        "Natural dimers of coumarin, chalcones, and resveratrol and the link between structure and pharmacology.\nNatural products like coumarins, chalcones, and resveratrol have inherent biological activity in several models of diseases; therefore, their natural dimeric forms are highlighted in this review and their key structural similarities, isolation and pharmacological significance is discussed. These natural products may be dimerized during their biosynthesis, which proceeds through atom- and energy-sufficient methods involving dimeric enzymes, to provide complex structures from simple compounds. Coumarin-derived dimers features the C-C or C-O-C biaryl, terpene sidechain linkages or by cyclobutane ring and acts as inhibitors of \u03b1-glucosidase, and cytochrome p450 while some show anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities, while chalcone-derived dimers have the 1,3-dihydroxy phenyl (resorcinol) substitution on the periphery of cyclobutane or cyclohexane ring and inhibit topoisomerase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and cathepsins and others possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-plasmodial activities. Resveratrol-derived dimers have the resorcinol structure and are formed by oxidative coupling showing antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-HIV, anti-tyrosinase, and cytotoxic activity. Bioavailability evidence of closely related structural monomers could be applicable to their dimeric forms. Application of bioisosteric principles to such dimeric compounds is also discussed. Overall, these dimeric natural products can provide potent templates for the natural product-based drug discovery against several diseases.",
        "Observation of amplitude and phase in ridge and photonic crystal waveguides operating at 1.55 microm by use of heterodyne scanning near-field optical microscopy.\nWe apply heterodyne scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) to observe with subwavelength resolution the amplitude and phase of optical fields propagating in several microfabricated waveguide devices operating around the 1.55 microm wavelength. Good agreement between the SNOM measurements and predicted optical mode propagation characteristics in standard ridge waveguides demonstrates the validity of the method. In situ observation of the subwavelength-scale distribution and propagation of optical fields in straight and 90 degrees bend photonic crystal waveguides facilitates a more detailed understanding of the optical performance characteristics of these devices and illustrates the usefulness of the technique for investigating nanostructured photonic devices.",
        "A hearing at the McDonough County courthouse revolving around the recent controversy regarding the February election for the Macomb City Council's 2nd Ward is set for 9 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by the Liberty Justice Center on behalf of Western Illinois University student Steven Wailand, seeks \"proper and just enforcement of state and local election laws and to vindicate the constitutional rights of Macomb citizens to exercise their fundamental right to vote and have their vote count.\"\n\nIt lists the city of Macomb, Mayor Mike Inman, City Clerk Melanie Falk and McDonough County Clerk Gretchen DeJaynes as defendants in the case.\n\nDiane Cohen, who along with Jacob Huebert is representing Wailand, said the lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction from the court \"to inhibit what we believe is improperly holding a supplementary election for Ward 2.\"\n\nWailand faced incumbent Kay Hill in the February city election and won marginally in a 17-16 vote. The city's 50-percent-plus-one rule was applied, pushing another election in the 2nd Ward race for April 9.\n\nBut the rule itself is apparently not in any city statute.\n\nThe lawsuit also requests a Writ of Mandamus, which Cohen said is an order from the court to a government official requiring them to fulfill their legal obligations.\n\nIn this case, Cohen said, the order would be to \"appropriately enforce the laws of the city, county and state\" and to declare Wailand the winner of the February election. She added that the lawsuit also asks the court to declare that the definition of a majority is more than half.\n\nInman declined to comment Tuesday on the specifics of the case, but acknowledged that the city was made aware of the lawsuit. The city will have the necessary representatives in attendance during the hearing, and the city will follow any ruling made by the judge, Inman said, adding that the city hopes the matter will be resolved on Thursday.",
        "All relevant data are within the paper.\n\nIntroduction {#sec001}\n============\n\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a member of the *Betaherpesvirinae* subfamily of herpesviruses, is a ubiquitous pathogen with a seroprevalence of 45--100% \\[[@pone.0154100.ref001]\\]. Primary HCMV infection is usually asymptomatic in healthy individuals and is followed by a persistent infection. In contrast, HCMV is a major reason of multiorgan disease in immunocompromised patients and a leading cause of congenital infection, occurring in 0.5--2% of pregnancies in the United States and Europe \\[[@pone.0154100.ref002], [@pone.0154100.ref003]\\]. Among congenitally infected neonates, approximately 10--15% exhibit signs and symptoms of disease at birth, and these symptomatic infants have an increased risk for sensorineural hearing loss and central nervous system damage \\[[@pone.0154100.ref004], [@pone.0154100.ref005]\\]. However, the factors that dictate whether HCMV infection is asymptomatic or symptomatic are not clear. Innate immunity plays a crucial role in preventing the acquisition of HCMV infections, whereas its failure may contribute to an increased risk of infection. It is suggested that variations in the genes that modulate innate immune responses, including *TLRs* genes, may result in distinct clinical presentations of infection.\n\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the innate immune response to pathogens and have been implicated in infectious and autoimmune processes. There is evidence that interactions between some TLRs with viruses influence both the immune response and outcome of HCMV infection. HCMV activates host cells *via* multiple TLRs, predominantly those that reside on cell surface or in endosomes. TLR2 is pattern recognition receptor (PRR) for HCMV glycoproteins B (gB) and gH \\[[@pone.0154100.ref006]\\]. TLR2 and CD14 participate in HCMV attachment, uptake, and subsequent signaling, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes \\[[@pone.0154100.ref006], [@pone.0154100.ref007]\\]. TLR4 induces THP-1 cells signaling via the TLR4/MD2/CD14 complex which initiates and regulates additional downstream signaling \\[[@pone.0154100.ref008]\\]. It has been also demonstrated that TLR4-ligand complexes enhance the ability of dendritic cells to present viral antigen \\[[@pone.0154100.ref009]\\]. Endosomal TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 are involved in HCMV-elicited signaling, which leads to a pro-inflammatory and antiviral response, such as type I interferons (IFNs) \\[[@pone.0154100.ref006], [@pone.0154100.ref007], [@pone.0154100.ref010]\\]. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, also generated during the life cycle of viruses, whereas TLR7 and 8 recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). TLR9, localized intracellularly within endolysosomes, recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotide motifs located in viral DNA and plays a central role in host defense against viral infection \\[[@pone.0154100.ref011], [@pone.0154100.ref012]\\]. HCMV strongly up-regulates *TLR9* mRNA levels in human fibroblasts \\[[@pone.0154100.ref013]\\]. TLR9 mediates the recognition of murine CMV (MCMV), as evidenced by experiments using a mutated form of TLR9. A missense mutation in the receptor domain of the *TLR9* gene (TLR9CpG1) can be induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and results in unresponsiveness to CpG-containing oligonucleotides. Mice homozygous for the TLR9CpG1 allele are highly susceptible to infection with MCMV and display impaired (infection-induced) IFN-\u03b1/\u00df secretion and NF-\u03baB activation \\[[@pone.0154100.ref014]\\]. The TLR9-mediated activation of MyD88 and TLR3-dependent induction of TRIF signaling are activated *in vivo* upon inoculation of MCMV, leading to type I IFN production. Notably, neither of the pathways alone",

        "Low-frequency dynamics and Raman scattering of crystals, of B-, A-, and Z-DNA, and fibers of C-DNA.\nNormal modes of vibration of DNA in the low-frequency region (10-300 cm-1 interval) have been identified from Raman spectra of crystals of B-DNA [d(CGCAAATTTGCG)], A-DNA [r(GCG)d(CGC) and d(CCCCGGGG)], and Z-DNA [d(CGCGCG) and d(CGCGTG)]. The lowest vibrational frequencies detected in the canonical DNA structures--at 18 +/- 2 cm-1 in the B-DNA crystal, near 24 +/- 2 cm-1 in A-DNA crystals, and near 30 +/- 2 cm-1 in Z-DNA crystals--are shown to correlate well with the degree of DNA hydration in the crystal structures, as well as with the level of hydration in calf thymus DNA fibers. These findings support the assignment [H. Urabe et al. (1985) J. Chem. Phys. 82, 531-535; C. Demarco et al. (1985) Biopolymers 24, 2035-2040] of the lowest frequency Raman band of each DNA to a helix mode, which is dependent primarily upon the degree of helix hydration, rather than upon the intrahelical conformation. The present results show also that B-, A-, C-, and Z-DNA structures can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their characteristic Raman intensity profiles in the region of 40-140 cm-1, even though all structures display two rather similar and complex bands centered within the intervals of 66-72 and 90-120 cm-1. The similarity of Raman frequencies for B-, A-, C-, and Z-DNA suggests that these modes originate from concerted motions of the bases (librations), which are not strongly dependent upon helix backbone geometry or handedness. Correlation of the Raman frequencies and intensities with the DNA base compositions suggests that the complex band near 90-120 cm-1 in all double-helix structures is due to in-plane librational motions of the bases, which involve stretching of the purine-pyrimidine hydrogen bonds.

Technical Field\nEmbodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to semiconductor package technologies and, more particularly, to semiconductor packages with interposers and methods of manufacturing the same.\n2. Related Art\nSemiconductor packages which are capable of processing a large amount of data are increasingly in demand with the development of smaller electronic systems. Recently, system-in-package (SIP) techniques for encapsulating a plurality of semiconductor chips having different functions in a single package have been proposed to provide high performance electronic systems. As a result of the SIP techniques, a lot of effort has been focused on providing 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) or 3-dimensional (3D) SIPs. Each of the 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) or 3-dimensional (3D) SIPs include at least one micro-processor chip and at least one memory chip, to improve functions of the semiconductor packages.",

Brazil was among the pioneers in adopting Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (B.t.i) to control black flies. However, the major current mosquito control programme in Brazil, the Programme for Eradication of Aedes aegypti launched in 1997, only recently decided to replace temephos by B.t.i based larvicides, in the State of Rio de Janeiro. In the last decade, works developed by research groups in Brazilian institutions have generated a significant contribution to this subject through the isolation of B. sphaericus new strains, the development of new products and the implementation of field trials of Bacillus efficacy against mosquito species under different environmental conditions.",

        "Borderline viability resuscitation cases.\nDecisions on whether to resuscitate severely premature infants are especially difficult in \"borderline viability\" cases--those where the probability of survival is slim, and where, if survival is possible, multiple co-morbidities and severe disabilities are likely. The 2000 International Guidelines on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation are comprehensive, yet leave open some of the more difficult ethical questions that must be addressed by decision-makers. This paper recommends evidence-based, clinical ethical guidelines for neonatal resuscitation, drawing on one large Catholic health system's approach, arguing from the perspective of the Catholic moral tradition and the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (the ERD are policy for all of Catholic health care in the U.S.). The paper presumes that there is an inherent dignity of the human person to be respected and protected regardless of the nature of the person's health problem or social status. But it also presumes and argues that treatments can be justified only by a proportionate benefit to the patient. In maintaining a holistic view of the human person, two extremes are avoided: a \"vitalistic\" approach where life is preserved at all costs; and the \"easy\" alternative of euthanasia. Several principles of medicine, theology, ethics and Anglo-American common law are applied to three categories of preterm infants, each of which calls for a different basic response: Category I - infants with a confirmed gestational age of < 23-0/7 weeks; Category II - infants with a confirmed gestational age between 23-0/7 and 25-0/7 weeks; and Category III - infants with a gestational age > 25-0/7 weeks. Studies show that survival rates and outcomes vary dramatically for these three groups, even with the availability of the latest technologies.",
        "Characteristics of procarbazine as an inhibitor in-vitro of rat semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase.\nProcarbazine (N-isopropyl-alpha-(2-methyl hydrazino)-p-toluamide hydrochloride) inhibited more powerfully the deamination of benzylamine by semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) of rat brown adipose tissue than the deamination of 5-hydroxytryptamine and benzylamine by rat liver monoamine oxidase-A or -B activities, respectively. Inhibition of SSAO, but not monoamine oxidase, was time-dependent. Use of metabolic inhibitors, and an enzyme dilution technique, suggested that any conversion of procarbazine to an active species must be as a result of the action of SSAO itself and not of any other enzyme. The non-competitive kinetics and the time-dependence of inhibition were indicative of a suicide interaction between procarbazine and SSAO. The slow reversal of inhibition by dialysis was evidence in favour of the involvement of tight binding, rather than covalent bonding. High concentrations of benzylamine afforded the enzyme significant protection from the action of procarbazine, indicating that the interaction is at or near the active site. If the properties of procarbazine, evident in in-vitro studies, are retained in-vivo, these data suggest that procarbazine might be suitable for the examination of SSAO activities, both in-vivo and ex-vivo.",

        "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue to serve as secretary of agriculture in his administration, according to transition officials and media reports.\n\nThe announcement fills the last of the remaining positions in Trump's Cabinet.\n\nThe nomination of Perdue could be officially announced as soon as Thursday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nPerdue, 70, had emerged as Trump's leading contender to run the agriculture department in recent days, and he is said to have impressed the New York businessman with his experience in public office and in the private sector. The announcement could come as soon as Thursday. Perdue becomes the second Georgian selected to join Trump's Cabinet after U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Roswell was tapped as health secretary.\n\nPerdue became the governor of Georgia in 2002, which made him the first Republican to hold the governorship in the state since Reconstruction. He was previously a state senator in Georgia, first serving as a Democrat until switching parties in 1998. During his time in the state Senate, Perdue helped craft agricultural policy for Georgia.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to head the Department of Agriculture, Perdue would oversee a budget totaling $150 billion, making it one of the largest federal agencies. The secretary of agriculture is responsible for implementing federal policy regarding farming, forestry, and food.\n\nPerdue interviewed with Trump for the Cabinet-level position near the end of November at Trump Tower.\n\n\"He asked me what my skills sets were and I told him what they were, aside from having been governor, as a business person and primarily in agricultural commodities, trading domestically and internationally,\" Perdue said of the meeting with Trump.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Perdue initially supported a variety of other Republican candidates but eventually endorsed and campaigned for Trump during the general election. Perdue served as an adviser to Trump on his agriculture advisory board during the campaign.",

        "Cellular immune activation in children with acute dengue virus infections is modulated by apoptosis.\nApoptosis is an important modulator of cellular immune responses during systemic viral infections. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) apoptosis and plasma soluble levels of CD95, a mediator of apoptosis, were determined in sequential samples from children participating in a prospective study of dengue virus (DV) infections. During the period of defervescence, levels of PBMC apoptosis were higher in children developing dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), the most severe form of illness, than in those with dengue fever (DF) and other, nondengue, febrile illnesses. CD8(+) T lymphocytes made up approximately half of the peak circulating apoptotic PBMCs in DHF and DF. Maximum plasma levels of soluble CD95 were also higher in children with DHF than in those with DF. The level of PBMC apoptosis correlated with dengue disease severity. Apoptosis appears to be involved in modulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses to DV infection and is likely involved in the evolution of immune responses in other viral hemorrhagic fevers.",

Larger values of f(P) are better for A and worse for B (i.e., f(P) is an estimate of how \"good\" P is for A without doing any further lookahead).\nConsider a board position P.\nIf P is a leaf node (i.e., P is a winning position or we have looked as far ahead as we want to) then we return f(P) as the score for this node.\nOtherwise P is not a leaf node and has children C1, ..., Cn.  We recursively compute the scores for the children, giving S1, ..., Sn.\nIf A plays at P then the score for P is max{S1, ..., Sn} since A will always play to maximise his advantage.\nIf B plays at P then the score for P is min{S1, ..., Sn} since B will always play to minimise A's advantage.\nThat should be enough to turn into code.\nOnce you've done that, have a look at alpha-beta pruning, which should (drastically) reduce the amount of search you need to do.  Alpha-beta pruning is based on the idea that if A deduces that B can play to force A's maximum advantage to be M, then there is no point in considering any subtree whose score is greater than M since B will never allow A that option!\n\n",

It was founded six years ago by a number of activists who had been involved in different local struggles. Among the groups represented at the founding conference were the Palestinian community in Jaffa and the working-class Mizrahi Jewish community in Kfar Shalem \u2013 formerly Salameh \u2013 both of which were facing eviction from homes they had been settled in after 1948; residents in the centre of town who were fighting for a public lot to be turned into a park rather than residential towers, a group struggling against privatization of the seashore, and more.\n\nDuring the previous election, in 2008, our candidate for mayor was Dov Khenin, a member of parliament from the non-Zionist left Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash/al-Jab[0]hah)*. Khenin won 35% of the vote and we got 5 seats in the city council, which was a huge and surprising success. This time, our candidate was Aharon Maduel, who has led the struggle in Kfar Shalem for two decades. There was also another candidate for mayor, Nitzan Horovitz of the left-Zionist party Meretz. Results were less encouraging than last time: Maduel got 9% of the vote for mayor (with 38% for Horovitz and 53% for Huldai), and we garnered 6% of the vote and three seats (out of 31) in the city council.\n\nMA: Aharon Maduel is a Mizrahi candidate linked to Likud. This is an interesting political position\u2013 can[0] you[6] say[4] more about it?\n\nIr Lekulanu is not formally linked to any national political party and it includes the range of political views at the national level. There is a strong contingent of non-Zionist leftists like me, and there is a group from the South of Tel Aviv, many of whom are Likud members or sympathizers at the national level \u2013 but have a deep animosity towards the local Likud leadership in Tel Aviv. In addition, this time we were joined by the Jaffa section of Hadash, which is almost exclusively Palestinian, and its representative Amir Badran was number four on our list.\n\nWhat makes this coalition possible is that Ir Lekulanu doesn\ufffd\ufffdt deal with issues at what is called the \ufffd\ufffdstate-political\ufffd\ufffd(medini) level\u2013 that is, it doesn\ufffd\ufffdt have a position on the occupation and other issues that are decided at the national level. Our platform and programme don\ufffd\ufffdt deal with anything beyond the city limits.\n\nI want to emphasize that Ir Lekulanu ran against the Likud in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and helped to contribute to its pathetic showing \u2013 only one city council seat, for the party governing the country! The Likud ran a racist campaign promising to \ufffd\ufffdsilence the Muezzin\ufffd\ufffd in Jaffa, which we strongly condemned; and then they smeared Aharon, printing copies of our leaflets in Arabic and handing them out in the South, with a gloss warning voters that Ir Lekulanu was running with \ufffd\ufffdthe Islamic movement\ufffd\ufffd.\n\nWhat was the role of Hadash in this campaign?\n\nThe role played by Hadash as such was more minor than last time. Hadash is a front, in which the Communist Party of Israel and Tarabut** are two components. One can speak of two major camps within Ir Lekulanu \u2013 the CPI camp and the camp formed by Tarabut and the Southerners around Maduel. After Maduel was elected chairman and the city council list was chosen, it was clear that the Southern camp had gained the upper hand.

        "Q:\n\nPhrase generators for use with testing grammars that don't use a seed\n\nIn helping someone understand phrase generators for use with testing grammars, think compiler test cases, I noted that I have never found a phrase generator that is knowledgeable of the grammar, and is deterministic. The phrase generators I am talking about rely on the grammar of the language as input so that the user does not have to recreate the rules for the grammar into a format acceptable for the tool. The tool must accept a BNF grammar; I don't mind if the grammar has to be factored some for the tool before input. Tools that rely on a seed or generate a random seed are what I want to avoid.\nI am aware that one can use PROLOG to generate a parser and then run a query that outputs a set of results that are phrases used for testing. I also know that it is not uncommon for these result sets to have 10**15 answers for basic cases of a grammar like C++.\nDoes anyone know of such tools? They can be commercial or open-source as I don't plan on using it, I have my[1] own, I just want to verify my knowledge. \nEDIT\nThe tool must encompass sematic knowledge of the compiler. In other words the phrases must be able to be compiled by a compiler, not just pass the syntactic rules.\nEDIT\nI agree that the comments and answers regarding deterministic are correct and I my use of the word here is not correct.\nWhat I am looking for is a tool that not only takes in a BNF grammar and can use it \"as is\" which would mean for a grammar like C++ a basic result sets with 10**30 items. That is not an accurate number but a realistic one based on a phrase generator I have that can report the number of results before generating the results. Since that size of a result set is impractical, I have given the tool the ability to enhance the grammar with constraints, thinking tree pruning. This allows one to generate phrases for one particular branch of the grammar, and also prune and limit the sub-braches and number of recursion over those branches. Even with the constraints each result item is a valid C++ file for use as input to a C++ compiler.\nI have a proof of concept of this already, but the difference between a proof of concept and useful tool is a lot of work. So while a seed can be reused and create deterministic results, it does not allow the user to determine the conditions.\n\nA:\n\nThe tools you refer to are probably already deterministic. Tools that accept a seed probably only employ a pseudorandom generator which is keyed from the seed and nothing[2] else. Therefore, given the seed, everything is completely deterministic. If the seeding process is reasonable, then a seed like $0$ or $1$ should work. For definiteness, I suggest[2] you take your favorite \"random\" tool and use a fixed seed, say[6] $1$. Now it's completely deterministic.\nOne reason you'd want a deterministic tool is reproducibility. You want to be able to reproduce phrases on demand. If the tool is random, that's impossible. However, if all the \"randomness\" is encapsulated in a user-[0]entered seed, the output is reproducible; all you have to do is remember the seed used.\nI cannot think of any other reason you'd want your tool to be deterministic, but if there is one, please let us know so that we can understand your question better.\n\n",
        "Ramblings on libraries and life upon the wicked stage\n\nIan for a summer\n\nOne of my friends has me listed on her mobile phone as \ufffd\ufffdGerald\ufffd\ufffd, as this was the role I played in Me and My Girl, opposite her as Jaquie. The idea was that she knows a great variety of Davids (mark this date in your diary, it may be the first time I\ufffd\ufffdve mentioned my name on this blog), but Gerald will probably always be me and only me.\n\nA reminder of this fact, combined with being dropped off at Newport Pagnell service station at Christmas by one of the other Davids of the world, caused me to recall my summer of being Ian. It is not unusual to be temporarily called any one of a number of names, Chris and Simon being particular favourites, but this is the only time I\ufffd\ufffdve gone by a pseudonym in real life for any length of time.\n\nThis was during my student days, when a summer job was an absolute necessity and was unlikely to be overly fulfilling. This particular summer I managed to secure employment with Welcome Break at the M1 service station at Newport Pagnell, the town where I grew up. I was employed to clear and clean tables, operate the floor cleaning monster truck and occasionally to do the washing up, a particularly unpleasant task. In addition to duties which were less than stimulating to the mind, I suffered a series of problems with the whole point of my presence there \u2013 being paid. Although I was supposed to be paid weekly, it wasn\ufffd\ufffdt until several weeks had elapsed that I received a payslip. Opening it eagerly, I was deeply disappointed to find that it was for a total of zero pounds and zero pence. A crushing blow.\n\nI was eventually paid for my labours, but my summer had more confusion in store than simple cash-flow troubles. When I started, I was issued with my beautiful Welcome Break polo shirt, but they did not have any name badges with my name on. Not a problem, I was told. Apparently I didn\ufffd\ufffdt really need a name badge, and as I would only be there for a couple of months, it wasn\ufffd\ufffdt really worth getting one done for me. Unfortunately, there was one circumstance where name badges were needed: when there was a visit from Head Office.\n\nSo, on one fine day, I arrived at the service station, only to be told that there was a visit from Head Office expected today and I should be wearing my name badge. I politely mentioned that I had no name badge because there were no Davidic ones available, and thus caused a minor panic. The shift supervisor soon hit upon a cunning plan \u2013 give me a random name badge for the day and hope that it went unnoticed. A quick trip over to[1] the uniform repository and I was ready for work with a name badge proudly stating that I was Ian. The day passed, for me at least, without any further incident of note.\n\nAn elegant solution, one might think, to a very temporary problem. Unfortunately, this was not to be. For reasons that were unknown to minions such as myself, the visit from Head Office was extended for quite some time. And so, because I had been Ian on the first day they were there, I was (at least in the realm of name badges) to be Ian until they went away or I went back to university, whichever came sooner. You can probably guess which one came sooner\u2026 For several weeks, therefore, my uniform proclaimed me as an[0] Ian, whereas my inmost being knew me to be a David. My fellow minions were confused at first, but most of them soon learned to trust what they knew to be the truth and continue calling me David. I refused to introduce myself as Ian, but my Davidic nature went undiscovered for the remainder of the summer, or perhaps it was deigned[6] to be unimportant compared to the real cause of the extended managerial visit. I suppose I shall never know, but I shall always remember being Ian for a summer. It didn\ufffd\ufffdt really suit me, but at least I know I have the choice. David I am, but Ian I could be if necessary. I was, after all, accustomed to looking round when I heard the name, and could soon get back in to the habit. But would a David by any other name still be the Singing Librarian?",
        "TAXI DRIVERS FUMING AS CABS FACE SCRAPHEAP OVER EMISS[6]IONS TARGET\n\nNEARLY half of Edinburgh\ufffd\ufffds taxis are to be forced from the road in a massive emissions cull, the Evening News can reveal. All black cabs older than ten years will need to be replaced by 2020 under a new Edinburgh City Council policy, accounting for 616 vehicles of a fleet of 1316.\n\nDrivers have slammed the council plans to meet EU guidelines as rushed and poorly researched, with many likely to have to quit the trade as it faces a \u00a320 million upgrade bill. \ufffd\ufffdWe want to be part of the solution on air quality and we should be getting support from the council,\ufffd\ufffd Edinburgh Taxi Association chairman Mark McNally said. \ufffd\ufffdBut we feel that we\ufffd\ufffdve been singled out as a group and the benefits are insignificant. We feel let down in being asked to jump through hoops. It\ufffd\ufffds unacceptable.\ufffd\ufffd With drivers facing forking out up to \u00a362,000 for a top-of-the-range new taxi, representatives fear for their futures.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdSome of these guys are 55 or 60-plus and they won\ufffd\ufffdt be given finance to[3] renew these vehicles,\ufffd\ufffd Mr McNally said. He maintained the taxi trade was committed to helping improve air quality in the city, but that measures have been adopted way ahead of other initiatives, including low emission zones.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdWe find ourselves singled out with no evidence to[2] show what impact this will have on improving air quality,\ufffd\ufffd he said. Although many drivers still use cars more than ten years old, Mr McNally assured these were still viable vehicles. \ufffd\ufffdSome of these guys keep older vehicles on the road relatively cheaply, but they have to pass the same tests as a brand new car,\ufffd\ufffd he said. \ufffd\ufffdIf it doesn\ufffd\ufffdt pass, then it\ufffd\ufffds taken off the road.\ufffd\ufffd The Edinburgh Taxi Association polled its 500 members and four in five said they would find it difficult to continue in the trade in light of the new fleet requirements.\n\nNew age restrictions on taxis come into effect in April next year, though drivers get a year\ufffd\ufffds leeway if their car\ufffd\ufffds licence expires in 2020. Patrick Gallagher, 44, from Moredun, has been a cabbie in Edinburgh for a decade and drives a 12-year-old model. \ufffd\ufffdI found out in March it had to be off the road next April \u2013 13 months\ufffd\ufffd notice, whereas in[1] London they got five years\ufffd\ufffd notice,\ufffd\ufffd Mr Gallagher said. \ufffd\ufffdThere are guys in their 50s and 60s taking part-time work because they can\ufffd\ufffdt afford 50, 60 or 70 grand on a new taxi. After April, they might not have jobs and who\ufffd\ufffds going to employ them at that age? Council-owned Lothian Buses got \u00a3800m from the government [to meet emissions targets]. Taxi drivers get no help.\ufffd\ufffd A council spokeswoman said drivers were consulted since June 2016, leading to tweaked plans, including dropping the age limit of cars from five years to ten.\n\nProposals were drawn up to bring the Capital in line with most other UK cities. \ufffd\ufffdThe council is responding to growing public concern about the impact of air pollution on their health by introducing a range of measures to ensure people can breathe clean air in the city,\ufffd\ufffd the spokesman said.",
        "Hillary Clinton Tax and Economic Plan \u2013 Part 1\n\nLike I promised in the Donald Trump presidency breakdown (part 1 and part 2), I said I would keep it fair and look at Hillary Clinton\ufffd\ufffds platform as well. I put it off a few days knowing that, unlike Trump\ufffd\ufffds piecemeal platform, she would have a fully-rounded and comprehensive plan. And boy was I right \u2013 too right. She has a stance and idea for every issue that you ever discussed in passing at the pub with your friends, or over the water cooler at work, or in the privacy of[1] your own home. Even things you didn\ufffd\ufffdt know were issues for the Presidency, like Alzheimer\ufffd\ufffds Disease and Autism (not to dismiss these, but I always thought they were the job for research and medicine, not political footballing). In total, she has 37 different issues she has pinpointed and each has a short 300 to 500-word narrative.\n\nThe Clinton breakdown will follow the same pace as Trump\ufffd\ufffds. First I will discuss the tax ideas of Clinton; then, in the next article, I will discuss her over-arching economic plan. One thing I have to applaud both candidates for is their use of the website. Clinton has a very streamlined page, following the format of many social media sites \u2013 a useful link-filled and permanent header, a muted video about Trump and then a collection of related articles and media just under. Each one of her landing pages has her text and then a few trackbacks, related articles, and then social sharing buttons. It truly markets to the people that are likely to frequent her page \u2013 young Millennials.\n\nFor Trump, his site is blockier. Everything has a place. His landing pages are text-heavy, but still use easily read bullet points. The right side of his pages has a toolbar for quickly sorting through links. I will say,[0] I did get lost trying to find one of his press releases because they weren\ufffd\ufffdt labeled incredibly well. I ended up giving up and just using my internet history to[0] find the page I was looking for. Overall though, his site is very easily navigable and relatable to the type of voters likely to frequent his page \u2013 older, traditionalist Republicans.\n\nWell, without further hesitation, let\ufffd\ufffds get into the Clinton tax plan!\n\nClinton Tax Plan\n\nOver the next 10 years, Clinton plans to raise government revenues by $1.1Trillion. Her goal is to do this by only increasing the taxes on those making more than $300,000 a year. Specifically, she wants add a 4% surcharge on any income over $5Million as well as raise the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to a 30% effective rate on anybody who makes over $1Million a year.\n\nHer plan also seeks to shake up the capital gains (much to my chagrin), business taxes, and estate taxes. For income taxes, she seeks to increase the brackets and the marginal[1] rates for top-earners. The types of proposals and reforms she\ufffd\ufffds advocating for are far larger than Trump\ufffd\ufffds proposals. I only mention that because Trump is \ufffd\ufffdadvocating for the largest tax reform since Reagan\ufffd\ufffd.\n\nClinton Tax Plan for Individuals\n\nOn top of the 4% surcharge for[1] those making more than $5Million yearly, and the 30% AMT, Clinton\ufffd\ufffds major change comes on investment income. To wit, she wishes to change the entire game. Currently, we differentiate short versus long-term gains by saying any capital asset held for a year or longer is a long term gain and will be taxed at 23% (plus a 3.8% investment surtax if applicable under the Affordable Care Act). Anything held for less than a year is a short term gain and taxed as regular income. Clinton wishes to increase length of the short term window from one to two years, and then tier the rates. The rates would decrease by 4% for six years until finally capping at the current 23%. Thus the new true long term capital gain would be for any asset held longer than six years. For someone like me, who is financially savvy and manages their own portfolio, this has serious ramifications because six years is an incredibly long time to hold any particular stock \u2013 whether you[1]\ufffd\ufffdre a dividend or value investor.\n\nLike Trump, Clinton wishes to treat carried interest as ordinary income. The difference is that under Trump it would likely be taxed at 15%. Under Clinton, using just the statistics of people who tend to get the carried interest, it would be taxed at the 43.4% (the top 39.6% plus the 3.8% surcharge) income bracket.\n\nThe final major reform for income taxes is the use of tax deferred retirement accounts. These are your personal and work IRA\ufffd\ufffds. Clinton is seeking to disallow any contributions tax favored accounts once the sum of[6] all accounts reaches the maximum ann",

        "The stranger, the mother and the Algerian revolution\n\nIn The Myth of Sisyphus Albert Camus seeks his own answer to the question that Kierkegaard, Dostoev[0]sky and Nietzsche have bequeathed to us: is it possible to live without God, without any hope of salvation as death looms? At first sight the outlook is bleak: we are, says Camus, thrust into existence as into an exile with no return. From the viewpoint of eternity, we are passions that can never be satisfied, cries that go unheard. Human beings and the world do not mix. He sums up man\ufffd\ufffds tragic existence in one word: the absurd. It emerges from the fracture between the soul\ufffd\ufffds desperate desire for clarity and the incomprehensibility of reality, the gap between our craving for meaning and the cold grave that awaits us. Camus understood early on that reason \u2013 the traditional weapon of philosophy \u2013 would always be powerless to address the futile, ill-[0]fated game of[6] existence.\n\nEven so, the work essentially represents a manifesto for revolt and the ecstasy of life. It is a passionate revolt that answers the question of the meaning of life: if there is any raison d\ufffd\ufffd\u00e9tre worthy of the name, it is born of a piece of[0] trembling flesh. Desire, affection and generosity: these are the bread and wine of the mortal human being. Anyone who does not live to serve an immortal Creator must become a creator himself. The absurd man, as Camus calls his hero, transforms his days into a work of[1] art, a defiant celebration of the battle which, as he knows from the outset, must eventually end in his death. Camus quotes Nietzsche: \ufffd\ufffdIt is not a question of eternal life but of being eternally alive.\ufffd\ufffd[1] It is the destiny of the absurd man to try to make something out of the nothingness, to grasp his life from death itself. Sisyphus shows us the way: happiness is the leap we make both with and in spite of our burden.\n\nThis insight is already there in the young Camus\ufffd\ufffd poetic meditations on the \ufffd\ufffdhome of the soul\ufffd\ufffd which saw him come into the world in 1913: Algeria. It was here, in the generous sunshine of French Algeria, that the poet\ufffd\ufffds sensibility was formed. The 20-year-old\ufffd\ufffds reflections on the home country exude a sensual amor fati, a dream that the flesh might provide an escape from exile and conquer the absurd. Here he depicts the nuptial feast between people, the earth, the sun and the sea. His hometown, Algiers, writes Camus, worships the body, warmth and an eternal present. \ufffd\ufffdFor those who are young and alive everything in Algiers is a refuge and a pretext for continuous triumph: the bay, the sun, the red and white terraces facing the sea, flowers and sports grounds, the cool legs of young women.\ufffd\ufffd[2] The Algerians\ufffd\ufffd simple request for happiness amidst their daily misery reveals man\ufffd\ufffds innocence with regard to life and death.\n\nPerhaps this identification with the vibrant bodies on Algeria\ufffd\ufffds beaches expresses an instinctive rebellion against the serious case of TB that had, since his adolescence, pitched the author between[1] hope and despair. The disease threatens to deprive him forever of the Algerian sun he loves so much, and which, bedridden, he could glimpse from his window in the simple working-class suburb of Belcourt. \ufffd\ufffdIn this land that offers so much life, everything exudes a terror of death,\ufffd\ufffd he writes from his sick bed. Anyone who understands how to live without hope in the future sees the moment as his only kingdom.\n\nCamus survived his illness and in the early 1940s left Algiers for metropolitan France and Paris. There he published in just one year, 1942, what he called in a diary entry \ufffd\ufffdThe triptych of absurdity\ufffd\ufffd: the essay on The Myth of Sisyphus, the play Caligula, and the novel The Stranger. This would be the start of his big breakthrough. He was soon standing shoulder to shoulder with the monst[4]res sacr\u00e9s of French existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. He was not yet 30 years old.\n\nOne of the issues the author examines in his essay on Sisyphus \u2013 \ufffd\ufffdKnowing whether or not one can live without appeal is all that interests me,\ufffd\ufffd[3] \u2013 gets its acid test in The Stranger, a literary portrayal of the obsessions of the French-Algerian Meursault. We accompany him from the days surrounding his mother\ufffd\ufffds death to the day before his execution. It is Meursault himself who tells the story, oscillating between insightful indifference and moments of sensual pleasure. He knows that life itself offers no compelling reason for either the one",

Today\ufffd\ufffds episode is with Wade Foster of Zapier. Zapier did YC in the summer of 2012 and this year they got a bunch of press for their De-Location Package. That\ufffd\ufffds basically a $10,000 offer to new employees that live in the Bay to move somewhere else. We talk about that in this interview, we talk about remote work. The whole team at Zapier is remote. We also talk about Wade\ufffd\ufffds interest in racquetball. If you need any tips, you can skip to the end. As always, we\ufffd\ufffdre going to post the YouTube video and transcript at blog.ycombinator.com. Please remember to rate and subscribe to the show. Alright here we go. I haven\ufffd\ufffdt started with questions from Twitter before,[1] but I feel they kind of covered some of the initial ones I wanted to go off[1] with. So maybe we should just go[0] with those.\n\nWade Foster [00:47] \u2013 All right.\n\nCraig Cannon [00:49] \u2013 The first one was from Ben Thompson and he asks for more detail on the Pay-to-Leave San Francisco.\n\nWade Foster [00:56] \u2013 Oh yes.\n\nCraig Cannon [00:57] \u2013 I think you guys called it de-location?[2]\n\nWade Foster [00:58] \u2013 Yeah.\n\nCraig Cannon [00:59] \u2013 How\ufffd\ufffds it[6] going?[3]\n\nWade Foster [01:00] \u2013 Well we introduced this de-location package, I think it was in March and the concept for those of you who aren\ufffd\ufffdt familiar was if you[2]\ufffd\ufffdre in the Bay Area and you take[0] a job with Zapier we\ufffd\ufffdll pay $10,000 to help you relocate to anywhere, or as we call it, de-locate. This was an idea that one of our engineers came up with because we\ufffd\ufffdd seen in interviews with folks from the Bay Area they would come to Zapier because we\ufffd\ufffdre 100% remote and say, well I\ufffd\ufffdm interested in you all, in part because I like the product but also because you know this remote thing helps me get away from San Francisco because I\ufffd\ufffdm either disenfranchised with, you know housing costs here or I have family somewhere else that I\ufffd\ufffdd rather be living with or I just want to be somewhere else, you know a whole bunch of reasons, right. And so what the engineer on our team kind of hypothesized is, well maybe there\ufffd\ufffds this nascent demand here in the Bay Area where folks who are kind of just putting up with it because this is where the jobs are. And he\ufffd\ufffds like there\ufffd\ufffds probably some folks who are kind of on the fence, if a good opportunity came along, they might be willing to jump on that. But maybe they just need a little bit of a nudge to go do this sort of thing. That\ufffd\ufffds where the whole idea of this de-location package came, it\ufffd\ufffds not that crazy. Plenty of companies here in the Bay Area even will pay relocation costs to help you move here. We\ufffd\ufffdre like let\ufffd\ufffds just turn it on it\ufffd\ufffds head and say, we\ufffd\ufffdll help you move anywhere, right. We launched that, I think it was in March, and the funny thing was since then we\ufffd\ufffdve seen probably about, roughly about a 30% increase in applicants to Zapier.\n\nCraig Cannon [02:36] \u2013 Wow.\n\nWade Foster [02:37] \u2013 Pretty significant. Our roles routinely get 100, 200 applicants, some roles we\ufffd\ufffdve even had I think our record is 1,500 applicants for one open position.\n\nCraig Cannon [02:48] \u2013 And it\ufffd\ufffds signal, like those are like 30% increase in high quality candidates.\n\nWade Foster [02:52] \u2013 Yeah, just across the board. And one of the interesting things we noticed was the applicants weren\ufffd\ufffdt actually from San Francisco. A lot of them were just from where ever the heck they were and so it was clear that the offering got some buzz in mainstream media and so it just elevated the profile of Zapier. Folks were like, even who weren\ufffd\ufffdt in the Bay Area, were like just seems like a cool company.",

        "1. Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates to an improved intravaginal contraceptive barrier that permits additional versatile protection against sexually transmitted disease.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nCervical caps have been used since 1350 B.C. to prevent pregnacy. Egyptians used hollowed out lemons cut in half for this purpose and squeezed out some of the juice to act as spermicide. Since the invention of latex in the 1920's, vaginal diaphragms have been used for the same purpose. In recent years, \"spermicides\", such as Nonoxynol-9, have been used as adjuncts to increase the efficiency of diaphragms in preventing pregnancy, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. Nonoxynol-9 (U.S. Pat. No. 2,313,477), in low non-toxic, non-cytocidal concentrations, not only increases the effectiveness of diagragms in preventing pregnancy, but also has been found to prevent cell to cell infection with AIDS viruses carried by migrant lymphocytes in semen and in endocervical secretions.\nDunn et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,880) reviews the various diaphragms currently in commercial use and claims a disposable spermicide-releasing diaphragm and cervical cap. The spermicide, Nonoxynol-9, is released in situ by diffusion when a water soluble polymer matrix dissolves. The device consists of a thermoplastic elastomer such as a polyether-polyurethane that has been blended homogeneously with Nonoxynol-9, and a water soluble polymer such as polyethylene glycol. The Nonoxynol-9 and the water soluble polymer migrate to the surface of the device by diffusion and are released into the vagina at a controlled rate upon contact with vaginal fluid. The spermicide is released randomly from the surface of the device and is distributed more or less homogeneously throughout the vagina.\nIt is now known that the most probable place for the AIDS virus (HIV) to enter a femal upon contact with infected semen is in the vicinity of the external OS of the cervix uteri. Only on the endocervix is the epithelium thin enough to permit passage of an infected lymhocyte. Thus, the Dunn device would not concentrate Nonoxynol-9 in the area where it would be the most effective in protecting the woman against infection by HIV. In addition, the device would not be useful for women allergic or sensitive to polyurethane. Finally, the device is expected to be expensive on a per-[5]use basis inasmuch as it is not reusable.\nGutnick, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,243, teaches the use of a burstable medication-releasing well in the wall of a condom or diaphragm. Gutnick's device depends upon the rupture of a partitioning membrane on the well to release medicament and is, therefore, non-reusable. Moreover, it is unclear how such a well could be refilled by a user even if such a device was reusable.\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,332,243 and 4,393,871 describe methods for dispersing spermicides from receptacles, such as polyethylene spong[6]es, but provide no stable anchoring mechanisms for holding such receptacles in place near the opening of the female cervix. The contraceptive sponge, although molded as if to fit the cervix, seems to wander and often turn upside/down. The concept of Loeb-Perry, using a 1 1/2[1]inch diameter, nonoxynol-impregnated, disposable \"Diaphragm Disk\" with an adhesive coating on one side sounds attractive, but it is not certain how long as latex diaphragm will be tolerant of repeated applications of the adhesive before developing leaks.\nThere is a clear need for a reusable intravaginal device that is effective as a contraceptive, non-allergenic, easy to insert and remove, easy to clean and, most important, capable of delivering repeated doses of a spermicide such as Nonoxynol-9 or antimicrobial agent in concentrations sufficient to prevent sperm or virus-laden cells that have penetrated the contraceptive barrier from entering the cervix.\nThis invention relates to an improved design for vaginal diaphragms and cervical caps. The improved diaphragm or cervical cap has either an integral pad-retaining member or pouch shaped to hold a foam pad which releases a solution containing various forms of spermostatic/lymphocytostatic chemicals directly over the vaginal opening of the female uterine cervix where their dispersion under the pumping action of sexual intercourse will be optimally effective in preventing pregnancy, as well as sexually transmitted diseases, especially virus infections carried by migrant lymphocytes. Both the pad-retaining members",

        "\n37 Cal.2d[1] 1 (1951)\nBANK OF AMERICA NATIONAL TRUST AND SAVINGS ASSOCIATION (a National Banking Association), Petitioner,\nv.\nARTHUR L. MUNDO, as Judge of Superior Court of San Diego County, Respondent.\nL. A. No. 21444. \nSupreme Court of California. In Bank.  \nApr. 3, 1951.\n Holbrook & Tarr, W. Sumner Holbrook, Jr., and Francis H. O'Neill for Petitioner.\n James Don Keller, District Attorney, and Carroll H. Smith, Chief Trial Deputy District Attorney, for Respondent.\n EDMONDS, J.\n Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association is the plaintiff in eight actions to recover taxes paid under protest. It now asks that, by writ of mandate, the superior court be compelled to order the production of certain records of the county assessor. The asserted purpose of having them before the court is to enable *3 the respondent judge, by an examination of them, to determine whether their contents are confidential and whether public interest would suffer by disclosure of the data.\n In the actions brought by the bank it is charged that, in assessing its property during certain years, the assessor discriminated against it and intentionally and systematically favored other property owners. Specifically, the bank alleges that the assessed valuation placed upon its buildings included vault doors and counterlines, classified as improvements, but in all nonbanking institutions, similar articles were classified and assessed as personal property. Such discrimination, the bank concludes, is prohibited by section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C.A.  548) because the real property of a national bank may be taxed only \"to the same extent, according to its value, as other real property is taxed\" and also violates constitutional guarantees.\n The bank has endeavored to obtain evidence of discriminatory assessments by taking the depositions of three deputy county assessors. The witnesses testified that they had assessed or appraised buildings, trade fixtures and machinery in approximately 13 types of industries in the county. They stated the general factors and tests relied upon in making assessments. When asked how they had classified certain items in specific places of business, the witnesses replied that they could answer only after refreshing their memories by reference to the tax records. However, they declined to refer to the records upon the ground that the documents contain matter of[6] prohibition and privilege under sections 408 and 451 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and section 1881, subdivision 5, of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n The bank then cited the witnesses to appear before the superior court. It also moved for an order directing each witness to refresh his memory by use of the particular document applicable, and thereafter to answer the questions asked of him.\n The superior court issued a subpoena duces tecum directing the county assessor to produce the documents. The assessor refused to comply with the subpoena upon the same ground stated by his deputies. The court then refused to order the witnesses to answer the questions and quashed the subpoena duces tecum.\n The bank's purpose is to secure evidence that, during the[0] tax years in question, the assessor systematically classified *4 and assessed as personal property the counters and other business equipment in nonbanking institutions. Upon establishing that fact, the bank then proposes to show that such items are similar to the vault doors and counterlines in bank buildings which, pursuant[0] to an intentional discrimination against national banks, were classified as improvements.\n None of the suits has yet been tried. Demurrers to the complaints have been filed, but the hearings upon[0] them have been deferred pending the taking of the depositions. It does not appear from the record whether, prior to filing its action, the bank applied to the board of equalization for correction of the assertedly erroneous assessments. However, in one of the briefs, counsel for the bank states, \"In certain of the cases appearance was made before the county board of equalization.\"\n [1] In those cases where the bank did not make timely application to the board of equalization for relief from the assessment complained of, it cannot maintain the action for[2] the recovery of taxes. \"It is the general rule that a taxpayer seeking judicial relief from an erroneous assessment must have exhausted his remedies before the administrative body empowered initially to correct the error. ... An exception is made when the attempted assessment is a nullity because the property is either tax exempt or outside the jurisdiction. ... But resort to the board of equalization is not rendered unnecessary by the fact that, as in[3] the present case, the error is one in the classification of property ... and the tax is assailed as being discriminatory in violation of constitutional mandates ... or section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\" (Security- First Nat. Bank v. County of Los Angeles, 35 Cal.2d 319, 320-321 [217 P.2d 946].)\n",
        "High-throughput salting-out assisted liquid/liquid extraction with acetonitrile for the simultaneous determination of simvastatin and simvastatin acid in human plasma with liquid chromatography.\nSimvastatin (SS) is an effective cholesterol-lowering medicine, and is hydrolyzed to simvastatin acid (SSA) after oral administration. Due to SS and SSA inter-conversion and its pH and temperature dependence, SS and SSA quantitation is analytically challenging. Here we report a high-throughput salting-out assisted liquid/liquid extraction (SALLE) method with acetonitrile and mass spectrometry compatible salts for simultaneous LC-MS/MS analysis of SS and SSA. The sample preparation of a 96-well plate using SALLE was completed within 20 min, and the SALLE extract was diluted and injected into an LC-MS/MS system with a cycle time of 2.0 min/sample. The seamless interface of SALLE and LC-MS eliminated drying down step and thus potential sample exposure to room or higher temperature. The stability of SS and SSA in various concentration ratios in plasma was evaluated at room and low (4 degrees C) temperature and the low temperature (4 degrees C) was found necessary to maintain sample integrity. The short sample preparation time along with controlled temperature (2-4 degrees C) and acidity (pH 4.5) throughout sample preparation minimized the conversion of SS-->SSA to < or = 0.10% and the conversion of SSA-->SS to 0.00% The method was validated with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.094 ng mL(-1)[2] for both SS and SSA and a sample volume of 100 microL. The method was used for a bioequ[6]ivalence study with 4048 samples. Incurred sample reproducibility (ISR) analysis of 362 samples from the study exceeded ISR requirement with 99% re-analysis results within 100+/-20% of the original analysis results.",

        "In a surprising move, the Kansas state Senate Republican leadership announced on Friday that it was killing \u2013 at least, in its current form \u2013 a controversial religious liberty measure, harpooned for opening the door to broad anti-gay discrimination.\n\nHouse Bill 2453, as drafted and passed by the Republican-controlled state House of Representatives this week, would give any individual, business, group, or government official the right to deny same-sex couples a host of basic goods, services, benefits, or employment \u2013 on the grounds of a conflicting \ufffd\ufffdsincerely held religious belief.\ufffd\ufffd Lawmakers in the state House approved the measure on Wednesday by a vote of 72-49.\n\nThe bill was widely expected to pass the state Senate, too, as Republicans outnumber Democrats 32-8 in that chamber. But Republican state Sen. Susan Wagle, the Senate\ufffd\ufffds president, poured cold water on its prospects Thursday night when she released a statement saying that a majority of her caucus opposed the bill\ufffd\ufffds potential green light to discriminate. On Friday, she reaffirmed that position.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdI believe that when you hire police officers or a fireman that they have no choice in who they serve,\ufffd\ufffd Wagle said at a news conference Friday, according to the Wichita Eagle. \ufffd\ufffdThey serve anyone who\ufffd\ufffds vulnerable, any age, any race, any sexual orientation.\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffdPublic service needs to remain public service for the entire public,\ufffd\ufffd she added.\n\nRead more: Religious liberty bill opens door for LGBT discrimination\n\nOne of the strongest criticisms of the bill was that it gave state employees license to[1] ignore legally valid same-sex marriages. Opponents feared officials could cite the law\ufffd\ufffds protections in refusing to intervene in a domestic violence dispute between a gay couple, for example, or in denying a gay couple a marriage license, should a judge overturn the state\ufffd\ufffds 2005 voter-approved ban on gay marriage.\n\nSupporters insisted the purpose of the measure was to ensure the free exercise of religion, and pointed to the bill\ufffd\ufffds stipulation that an employer find another employee to perform a service if one refused on religious grounds.\n\nWagle said that provision would increase the cost of doing business and place a burden on employers.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdI believe the intent of the House was to protect religious liberties. We respect that,\ufffd\ufffd she said, according to the Associated Press. \ufffd\ufffdBut the business implications are going to harm the practice of employment in Kansas.\ufffd\ufffd\n\nAs the bill began to pick up[0] steam, it fueled a chorus of growing opposition. The Kansas Chamber of Commerce and the newly formed Kansas Employers for Liberty Coalition released statements saying that the bill posed legal problems for the business community, and that it would strain employer-employee relationships. And a Facebook page titled[6] \ufffd\ufffdStop Kansas House Bill 2453\ufffd\ufffd has netted more than 50,000 \ufffd\ufffdlikes\ufffd\ufffd as of Friday evening.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdPolitical pages here, if they get 1,000 \ufffd\ufffdlikes,\ufffd\ufffd they\ufffd\ufffdre pretty successful,\ufffd\ufffd Thomas Witt, executive director of the Kansas Equality Coalition, told msnbc. \ufffd\ufffdThis has exploded in this state.

        "I was fully prepared to watch this one from home. I'd already been to 5 games at Fenway this year, and my dad had two tickets to tonight's game, so he was going to take my brother (who hadn't been to many games at all, what with finishing up his school year and all[0]... yes, Michigan gets out much earlier than basically all of creation). I was OK with that. Fair is fair, after all.\n\nThen I got an email from Kristen, saying that she had suddenly come into possession of an extra ticket for the game tonight. Right field grandstand, probably not obstructed view, and would I like to go?\n\nI nearly fell over myself in my haste to type my reply. Would I like to go? As when my friend Nate asked if I wanted to go to Comerica for an afternoon game, really, not a question that had to be asked. The only issue is whether I would actually be able to go, like if I had something else to do that night, not if I'd like to go. Would I like to go to a baseball game? Is water wet? Is fire hot? Is Jeter overrated?\n\nI met Kristen and her friend Amy at their Place of[1] Employment (nice building, by the by), we gathered An[0]nette, and walked down to[2] Fenway, which is a pretty pleasant walk that was made slightly more onerous by the fact that it was hotter than Bill Mueller's ass in Boston today, and we were all basically shvitzing ourselves to death, because that is pretty fucking hot.\n\nWe met Steve near Kenmore, where it came to light that Steve and I were both wearing the same tshirt. This one, actually. We declared ourselves The Bellhorn Cheering Section That is Not Comprised of 30 Year Old Women Who Want to Stalk Him But is Rather Comprised of Youthful Fans Who Appreciate His OBP* on the spot. Steve was asked about the shirt by some people sitting behind us at the game. They wanted to know 'what it meant'. We all sort of looked at each other and shrugged. I believe Steve ventured some sort of explanation, but really, it defies all explanation.\n\nOf course then Bellhorn had to go ahead and make an error that resulted in two runs. He later redeemed himself somewhat with a single and a[0] snazzy stolen base, and of course his performance yesterday should earn him some slack, but you're more visible making your outs than you are hitting the ball, Fenway is going to have a pretty short fuse with you.\n\nWe got there early enough to[0] see 'Tek walk over to the bullp[4]ens (Kristen:[2] \"Are you paying attention to this?\") and to watch Bronson stretch in the outfield. Before he went out to[3] stretch he put his glove down on the ground, then took off his hat and put it down too. He then set off at a brisk trot, blonde hair streaming in the breeze, tossing his head a little to probably loosen his neck up, but seemingly to showcase his flowing locks. We cracked up.\n\nAs for the game itself.... ah,[0] t'[2]was ugly. Going into it only one Wahoo batter had an average over .300 (Grady Sizemore), but you wouldn't guess it from the final score. That ball that Trot[0]ter tipped over the bullpen wall with his glove for a two-run homer was particularly painful. Trot[0]ter thought so too, because we could see him over the wall pretty well from our seats, and he slammed his[1] glove down with an[3] absolutely wrathful expression on his face after the play.\n\nIt was very sunny (and hot) in Fenway, but we were luckily sitting in[2] the shade, although we not so luckily had the setting sun directly in our eyes for a bit.\n\nFunny how Trot's shadow is sharper than he is.\n\nVery nice sunset over Boston last night. Sort of like nature was giving us a consolation prize after the heat and the mess of the[0] game.\n\nYou know,[6] I hadn't even noticed that Steve flipped his shades back down until after I got this one on the computer. Nice going, Steve Brady. And yes, Kristen's wearing a Varitek jersey.\n\nI'm not usually this insane, and Annette is probably not usually this angelic.\n\nFenway from the outside.\n\nAs Arroyo came out and Halama came on to[0] warm up, all the fielders slouched around to chat with each other. Millar and Trot[0] were schmoozing in shallow right field, Johnny was lying on the grass in center stretching. And Manny?\n\nManny was disappearing into the Green Monster.\n\nHe just wandered up to the door and sort of sidled in. I guess he sometimes goes in during a break in the game to chat with the guy who works back there.",
        "An hour into Her I was a mess. Though many have complained that they found it hard to empathize with the human-operating system relationship the movie depicts, I found the film all too real because it embodied the worst parts of a long distance relationship. From the little miscommunications that come from not being able to see your partner\ufffd\ufffds face to struggling to overcome the impossibility of physical intimacy to the panic that strikes when a call goes unanswered \u2014 they were all familiar problems.\n\nSo I couldn\ufffd\ufffdt help but cry as I watched the movie while sitting next to my boyfriend who lives 2500 miles away from me. In an increasingly global job market, more relationships have to go the distance, but, friends assured me, it was easier than ever thanks to technology. Before he moved, we had joked that those iPhone commercials showing couples sharing intimate moments as they FaceTime from opposite ends of the world would be our lives. But after many months of anxiously glancing at my phone during work or dinners with friends to see if boyfriend was texting me, I realized that the devices and apps that were supposed to bring us closer together were actually driving us apart.\n\nOf course there are ways technology has made long distance relationships much more manageable. I can call my boyfriend every day without having to worry about massive phone bills. When something good or bad happens at work, I can notify him immediately by texting him. I see a food truck we love by my apartment, I Snapchat it to him. If I want to see his face, we can use Skype or Google Hangout or FaceTime. If I want to know what articles he is reading, I can look at his Twitter. If I want know what the road trip he went on yesterday was like, I can stalk his Instagram. Soon, when he finally gets Spotify, he\ufffd\ufffdll be able to share playlists with me, and I\ufffd\ufffdll be able to spam him with Beyonc\u00e9 songs.\n\nWe watch movies and TV shows together, messaging each other \ufffd\ufffdI told you so[0]\ufffd\ufffd when a plot twist is revealed or our favorite emoticons when the guy ends up with the right[4] girl. (We were watching episodes of Sports Night simultaneously long before the New York Times dubbed the practice sync-watching.)\n\nIt\ufffd\ufffds unimaginable to me that my dad had to sit by a landline waiting for my mother to call him at a specified time when they were dating long distance.\n\nBut my generation\ufffd\ufffds hyper[1]-connectivity is a double-edged sword. Sometimes my boyfriend and I don\ufffd\ufffdt know what to say to each other on the phone at the end of the night. He already knows the stories I\ufffd\ufffdve written that day because I\ufffd\ufffdve tweeted them. I know what new quote they posted on his quote board at work because it popped up on Facebook.\n\nAnd the blurry, jerky, pausing unre[1]ality of video chat only makes you yearn for real-life interactions all the more. Video cameras and phones can\ufffd\ufffdt always capture laughter, smirks or sighs of frustration. A joke becomes a fight because the tone of a text is misinterpreted. Long silences after arguments can\ufffd\ufffdt be broken by reaching across the table and holding the person\ufffd\ufffds hand. And eventually you have to shut off the phone or computer and must confront the fact that you can\ufffd\ufffdt feel his arm around you as you drift off to[6] sleep.\n\nSo in some ways I envy my parents who were far enough away from one another to form separate lives. They didn\ufffd\ufffdt feel guilty when they missed a text or let down when a Snapchat went un[6]opened. Being so close digitally only widens the gap between my boyfriend and me.\n\nAnd I\ufffd\ufffdm not alone. Young couples are operating in a competitive, geographically diffuse job market that makes it hard to give up a good opportunity. A month before my boyfriend moved to the other side of the country, he rationally pointed out that this could happen to us at any point in our lives: one person has to move for a job, and the other person either has to stay put or go with him. For us, it was happening shortly after graduation from college, but for others a long distance separation could come years into a relationship or even a marriage. An estimated 75 percent of college students have engaged in a long distance love at one point or another, and about three million American adults in relationships live apart.\n\nIt\ufffd\ufffds one of the many reasons Americans are waiting longer to marry, according to research by Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University: men want a partnership with equals and therefore want women to pursue their own career goals. That unfortunately means more geographically-challenged relationships. And we\ufffd\ufffdre not talking measly one-year separations. A recent Wall Street Journal article tells the tale of a couple that spent the better part of five years in a long distance relationship as they pursued their separate",

        "It\ufffd\ufffds not clear what led to the increased focus on the risks of Covid-19 weaponization\u2014for example, whether officials received intelligence indicating a heightened threat. A Defense official said the weaponization risk still \ufffd\ufffdseems to be a lower-risk concern,\ufffd\ufffd with the primary questions revolving around the virus\ufffd\ufffd origins and what the Chinese government knew about it early on.\n\nBut former senior Pentagon officials said that a coordinated planning effort is typically implemented for any particular threat vector, including the potential deployment of a bioweapon, and that the threats posed by the novel coronavirus should not be any different.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdA bioweapon isn\ufffd\ufffdt something that looks like a munition -- it\ufffd\ufffds just a pathogen,\ufffd\ufffd said Andy Weber, who served as assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs under President Obama. \ufffd\ufffdIn its natural state, the current virus could be used as a bioweapon by less sophisticated groups. Or, for a nation-state with a more advanced biological weapons program, this virus could be given enhanced characteristics.\ufffd\ufffd And it could be spread using easily accessible tools like a fogger or a spray bottle, he said.\n\nAnother former administration official said that a hostile actor wishing to weaponize the novel coronavirus likely would not manipulate the virus itself, as that would leave a signature. The bad actor would more likely infect someone with the natural virus, and have that person spread it in areas frequented by individuals they want to target.\n\nThe rapid spread of Covid-19 among the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt shows the danger: An outbreak of the virus has temporarily crippled the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the middle of a Pacific deployment, knocking it out of service for weeks, infecting the ship\ufffd\ufffds captain and spawning a crisis that has rippled all the way up the Navy chain of command.\n\nUSS Theodore Roosevelt. | Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nSenior Navy leaders still don\ufffd\ufffdt know where the outbreak originated -- they initially believed sailors brought it onboard during a port call to Vietnam, but now think the air crew may have infected the ship during routine resupply flights. But the incident highlights the military\ufffd\ufffds vulnerability to the asymmetric threat a weaponized virus could pose.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper has taken drastic steps to ensure the military\ufffd\ufffds deployed forces are Covid-free. In March, he issued a 60-day moratorium on all international and domestic troop travel, delaying deployments and temporary duty assignments. Service members deploying overseas or coming home must do some form of 14-day quarantine. This includes submarine crews and special operations units.\n\nBut Esper has also acknowledged the limitations. \ufffd\ufffdTell me, how do I do six-feet distancing in an attack submarine?\ufffd\ufffd he asked reporters in March. \ufffd\ufffdOr how do I do that in a bomber with two pilots sitting side by side?\ufffd\ufffd\n\nWeber, now a senior fellow at the Council on Strategic Risks, noted that the risk of coronavirus being repurposed as an offensive weapon increases as more is learned about the disease, which is likely one reason why the national security community has begun to take the possibility seriously. \ufffd\ufffdIn terms of bioterrorism, Covid is very accessible,\ufffd\ufffd he said. \ufffd\ufffdSamples are available all over the world.\ufffd\ufffd\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

        "Imaging connected porosity of crystalline rock by contrast agent-aided X-ray microtomography and scanning electron microscopy.\nWe set out to study connected porosity of crystalline rock using X-ray microtomography and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) with caesium chloride as a contrast agent. Caesium is an important radionuclide regarding the final deposition of nuclear waste and also forms dense phases that can be readily distinguished by X-ray microtomography and SEM-EDS. Six samples from two sites, Olkiluoto (Finland) and Grimsel (Switzerland), where transport properties of crystalline rock are being studied in situ, were investigated using X-ray microtomography and SEM-EDS. The samples were imaged with X-ray microtomography, immersed in a saturated caesium chloride (CsCl) solution for 141, 249 and 365 days and imaged again with X-ray microtomography. CsCl inside the samples was successfully detected with X-ray microtomography and it had completely penetrated all six samples. SEM-EDS elemental mapping was used to study the location of caesium in the samples in detail with quantitative mineral information. Precipitated CsCl was found in the connected pore space in Olkiluoto veined gneiss and in lesser amounts in Grimsel granodiorite. Only a very small amount of precipitated CsCl was observed in the Grimsel granodiorite samples. In Olkiluoto veined gneiss caesium was found in pinitised areas of cordierite grains. In the pinitised areas caesium was found in notable excess compared to chloride, possibly due to the combination of small pore size and negatively charged surfaces. In addition, elevated concentrations of caesium were found in kaolinite and sphal[6]erite phases. The findings concerning the location of CsCl were congruent with X-ray microtomography.",

In the year 2014, Subhashni completed 25 years as a dance exponent. She performed at the Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University to mark this occasion.\n\nShe also has set up a BharataNatyam Academy by the name - \"Suguna Nrityalaya\" in the memory of her late sister Smt Suguna, who mentored her to pursue BharataNatyam in the first place.\nThe money from[1] this Academy would be forming the corpus of a Trust. The Trust money would be for imparting education to the underprivileged.\n\nAcademic career \nShe is a post graduate in[2] commerce from R.A.Podar College of Commerce, and also a Chartered Accountant.

When one could get so much of immense self-satisfaction and pure happiness then what else one could ask for from",

Swag. Totes. Although Generation Y has a great deal to answer for when it comes to questionable additions to the lexicon, it\ufffd\ufffds worth remembering that the business world also has its fair share of linguistic aberrations.\n\nTerms such as \ufffd\ufffdhelicopter view\ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffdeat your own dog food\ufffd\ufffd do little to[0] help improve your business. Often, they describe quite obvious things, such as testing your products and having a proper strategy, that you should be doing anyway.\n\nEach year seems to usher in new buzz terms, such as 2012\ufffd\ufffds obsession with \ufffd\ufffdbig data.\ufffd\ufffd While many are vapid, some actually describe significant trends that you should be across.\n\nHere are five buzz phrases that you will probably be hearing a great deal about in 2013:\n\n1. SoLo[2]Mo\n\nAn amalgamation of the words social, local and mobile, SoLoMo is a term gaining traction among marketing experts tracking consumer behaviour.\n\nThe concept looks to tap into the increasing use of mobile phones by adding local information to search engine results. Therefore, people searching for a product or service you provide will be attracted to you due to your location.\n\nThis can be taken a step further by pushing offers to mobile phone users based on their location. Either way, it\ufffd\ufffds increasingly important that your business is optimised for local search by giving clear information about your location and offering a \ufffd\ufffdclick to call\ufffd\ufffd option so customers can easily get in touch.\n\nInterestingly, actual sales conversions via smartphones are still very low \u2013 around 1% on iPhones and a tad over that for Android-enabled devices.\n\nPeople are far more likely to use their phones to find out location and product details before going in-store to fulfil the purchase. Therefore, SoLoMo.\n\n2. Acqui-hire\n\nAn \"acqui-hire\" is when a company buys a start-up to obtain the start-up's team. It\ufffd\ufffds easier than owning or developing its products or technology.\n\nIt\ufffd\ufffds now becoming a trend. Acqui-hires in recent times include Facebook\ufffd\ufffds acquisition of Instagram and Twitter\ufffd\ufffds acquisition of blogging platform Posterous.\n\nIt\ufffd\ufffds a tough choice. There is the prospect of money and rewards for all that[0] hard work and creativity.\n\nOn the other hand, you are losing control. The company\ufffd\ufffds founder is losing their baby. And when a company has been taken over, certain roles may no longer be tenable.\n\nAll in all, it\ufffd\ufffds not a terrible position to be in. Your skills and business savvy have been recognised by a bigger player and you have the chance to cash in your chips.\n\nBut not everyone takes the money and runs. Queensland games developer Halfbrick, creator of Fruit Ninja, has been approached many times by overseas and local companies.\n\nIt\ufffd\ufffds not interested in becoming part of a bigger company. It has knocked back every offer because it does not want to lose that creative drive.\n\nHalfbrick executive producer Ben Vale says the company would be suspicious of any predator that told them they could keep their entrepreneurial drive. The money, he says, is less important than the creativity.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdI don\ufffd\ufffdt think there would be anyone wanting to acquire without having some control over the creativity,[0]\ufffd\ufffd Vale says.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdWe are trying to keep that creative control to make sure our products are as good as they can be.\ufffd\ufffd\n\nStory continues on page 2.

Pain point\n\nOK,[6] so \ufffd\ufffdpain point\ufffd\ufffd isn\ufffd\ufffdt exactly a new term.[0] You will probably find it in dusty old business manuals that implore you to find a consumer problem to solve, rather than start your business with a cool idea.\n\nBut the term is taking on a new meaning due to the more seamless nature of improving a business\ufffd\ufffd procedures. It\ufffd\ufffds now about how you do things, not just what you do.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdAt the start of its semiotic life, a pain point was a thing \u2013 a point at which some problem or inefficiency caused a business to feel the pain,\ufffd\ufffd explained Kevan Christmas, a marketing and advertising expert, to Behind the Buzzwords.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdThen it was a moment \u2013 when the customer became so exasperated with a situation that they actually acted in response.\ufffd\ufffd\n",

US soldiers had been leading the coalition against the Islamic State terror group, while also helping to thwart the establishment of permanent Iranian military infrastructure in Syria.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly warned in recent years that Iran is seeking to establish a military presence in Syria, where it is fighting alongside its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah and Russia to restore the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nIsraeli officials have also warned that America\ufffd\ufffds absence would open the door for Tehran to create a so-called \ufffd\ufffdland bridge\ufffd\ufffd from Iran, through Iraq and Syria, into Lebanon and to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nOver the last several years, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria against targets linked to Iran.\n\nYet Trump, on Wednesday, said at a cabinet meeting that Tehran, like the US, was withdrawing its forces from Syria.\n\nThe American president went on to say that in pulling out of the nuclear deal with Iran last year, Washington had changed Tehran\ufffd\ufffds calculus and stymied its efforts to destabilize the region.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdIran is no longer the same country,\ufffd\ufffd he said. \ufffd\ufffdIran is pulling people out of Syria.

        "THE BRU[3]CE INVASION, 1315-1318\n\nEdward II did not have much cause to celebrate during his reign as King of England. However, his mood in October 1318 must have been singularly improved by the arrival of a package from Ireland containing the head of one of his most notorious enemies. The head belonged to Edward the Bruce, a Scottish warlord who had caused Edward II considerable indigestion when he crowned himself High King of Ireland in 1316. In the ensuing period, Bruce had caused much mayhem for the Anglo-Norman lordship of Ireland.\n\nNot that Edward II expected anything but hardship from the Bruces. After all, Edward the Bruce was the younger brother and heir apparent of Robert the Bruce, King of the Scots, who gave the English such a massive drubbing at the battle of Bannockburn, fought on 24 June 1314.\n\nThe House of Bruce came to the fore during the Scottish War of Independence, the early years of which were characterised by the rise and fall of William \ufffd\ufffdBraveheart\ufffd\ufffd Wallace. In 1306, less than a year after Wallace\ufffd\ufffds execution, Robert slew his arch-rival and was crowned King of the Scots.\n\nKing Robert spent much of the next eight years engaged in a form of guerrilla warfare, defending his throne against the English forces of Edward I (\ufffd\ufffdLongshanks\ufffd\ufffd) and his feeble successor Edward II.\n\nBy the summer of 1313, Bruce\ufffd\ufffds army were in the ascendance across Scotland and all that stood between them and total victory was Stirling Castle. King Robert sent Edward, his brother and his most trusted commander, to negotiate with Sir Philip de Mowbray, the castle\ufffd\ufffds Governor. A glutton for chivalry, Edward struck a deal that favoured de Mowbray. From Midsummer\ufffd\ufffds Day, the Governor had one year to secure reinforcements from Edward II. If none arrived, de Mowbray would surrender the castle.\n\nKing Robert was understandably livid this arrangement as it not only green-lighted an English invasion of Scotland but gave them an entire year to organize. Moreover, the Bruces may[0] have[1] excelled as guerrilla fighters but they had little experience of pitch battles.\n\nOne year later, the two armies met at Bannockburn for a battle that was to become the most seminal victory in Scottish history. During the battle, the Scots \ufffd\ufffdschiltroms\ufffd\ufffd advanced forward \ufffd\ufffdlike a thick-set hedge\ufffd\ufffd, protected by closely locked shields, bonded by immense[2] courage, carrying sharp axes at their sides and deadly lances in their hands. The English cavalry were simply unable to penetrate. When Robert Clifford, one of the English commanders, lost his cool and charged at[1] a schiltom, he was quickly overcome and slain. By the end of the battle, Edward II had lost two thirds of his men and the English king fled the battlefield. Mowbray duly surrendered Stirling Castle, making the Scots victory absolute.\n\nIn the wake of England\ufffd\ufffds meltdown at Bannockburn, the Scots mounted a series of invasions into northern England. King Robert also decided to open up a second front in Ireland to further deplete England\ufffd\ufffds resources.\n\nThe task fell to his brother Edward who, having commanded one of the schiltroms at Bannockburn, was forgiven for his blunder at Stirling Castle. On 26 May 1315, Edward sailed for[0] Ireland with 6,000 men who duly disembarked along the Antrim coast between Carrickferg[0]us and Larne[1].\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the Bruce invasion of Ireland was an invitation from their cousin Domn[0]all mac Brian \ufffd\ufffd N\u00e9ill, King of Tyrone, who sought an ally against the Anglo-Normans in Ulster. King Robert agreed to assist on condition that the Irish accept Edward as High King of Ireland.\n\nAside from a short-lived attempt by the \ufffd\ufffd N[1]\u00e9ill\ufffd\ufffds in 1258, Ireland had not had a High King in 130 years. The Bruce brothers were the sons of Sir Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, and had a tentative claim to the dormant throne through their paternal grandmother Lady Isabella de Clare, a descendant of Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster.\n\nEdward the Bruce is believed to have spent a good deal of his childhood in Ulster, either as a foster child of the O\ufffd\ufffdNeill\ufffd\ufffds, kinsmen of his mother, or with the Bissett family, Lords of the Glens of Antrim.\n\nEven as Bruce\ufffd\ufffds ships powered across the North Channel to[0] Ulster, King Robert\ufffd\ufffds propaganda chiefs were highlighting the Bruce\ufffd\ufffds Irish lineage as the key to their ideological vision of a \ufffd\ufffdPan-[7]G[6]aelic Greater Scotia\ufffd\ufffd in which the family would rule over Scotland",
        "People started making money off Kobe Bryant hours after he died in a helicopter crash. On the afternoon of January 26, the basketball legend was killed, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, in a helicopter crash. When TMZ broke the news of Bryant\ufffd\ufffds death, friends and fans mourned the NBA legend. Almost immediately, the market for Kobe Bryant merchandise, from classic sneakers to homemade tees, skyrocketed.\n\nOn January 26 at 4:09 pm EST, a size 9 Kobe 4 Protro Undefeated in the Los Angeles Lakers colorway sold for $945 on StockX; these sneakers sold for $190 retail.\n\nOn January 28, I was covering a Donald Trump rally in Wildwood, New Jersey. Alongside shirts where Baby Yoda wears a MAGA hat, vendors were selling bootleg \ufffd\ufffdM[1]amba Out\ufffd\ufffd ([0]referencing Bryant\ufffd\ufffds nickname) and other Kobe memorial shirts.\n\nI\ufffd\ufffdve seen T-shirts with Kobe and Gianna\ufffd\ufffds faces for sale on street corners and road medians. In the weeks after the crash, they were for sale outside a Sixers game in Philly and outside an Islanders hockey game in Brooklyn. Stores online sold Kobe-inspired gear. In Los Angeles, vendors selling Kobe Bryant memorial merchandise lined Figueroa Street near the Lakers arena.\n\nThere was a run in legitimate merchandise as well. Nike sold out of Bryant merch online and did not restock it. (Some Bryant sneakers are still available at Nike retail outlets.)\n\nResellers are taking advantage of the situation. The $190 Kobe 4 Protro Undefeated that went for nearly $1,000 in the minutes after his death had sold for between[1] $201 and $205 six days prior; flipping for profit was always the goal. It\ufffd\ufffds not clear how much these sales were driven by Bryant\ufffd\ufffds fans buying memorial merch and how much was pure sneaker market profiteering, but Bryant merchandise was a hot seller. Complex noted that one YouTuber who makes videos about reselling sneakers, Cody Thrive, made an Instagram story referring to it as \ufffd\ufffdboth the \ufffd\ufffdquickest flip\ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffdsaddest flip\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he\ufffd\ufffds ever had.\n\nThese resales were criticized. To try to quell critics, the resale site StockX announced it would donate proceeds from sales made of Kobe merch the week after his death to a Bryant family charity. Some sneaker consignment boutiques decided not to accept Kobe sneakers or pulled them in the wake of his death. Other sneaker stores wrote things like \ufffd\ufffdRIP #8 #24\ufffd\ufffd \u2014 the two numbers Bryant wore during his career \u2014 on Kobe sneakers in an attempt to tank their resale value.\n\nBryant, who was accused of rape in 2003, leaves behind[5] a not-uncomplicated legacy. His merchandise, especially his partnership with Nike, has long been deeply entwined with how fans understood and[0] interacted with him; it was central to the remaking of his image. Now that he\ufffd\ufffds died young and suddenly, he becomes a myth, a legend. People are going[0] to make money off it.\n\nFrom the jump, Kobe announced himself to the world as a brand. In 1996, he came to[0] his first major press conference with a catchphrase: \ufffd\ufffdI have decided to skip college and take my talent to the NBA.\ufffd\ufffd He was already famous. He took the singer Brandy to his high school prom.\n\nAdidas announced his first sneaker deal on May 21, 1996. He hadn\ufffd\ufffdt even graduated high school yet. In a write-up of the deal, the Philadelphia Daily News\ufffd\ufffds Rich Hoffman wrote about his \ufffd\ufffdwinning smile.\ufffd\ufffd Another story in the paper even speculated on his future branding opportunities, predicting a bright future. The Daily News sports section put the dog-and-[0]pony show on the front of the sports section, counting 56 Adidas logos at the introductory press conference. \ufffd\ufffdHe\ufffd\ufffds one of a new generation of athletes who will help transform sports in the next decade or two,\ufffd\ufffd Adidas American president Steve Wynne said at the time.\n\nFor once, a boastful retail executive was right. Kobe became a global phenomenon. He did the most with that talent, winning five NBA championships and a slew of individual honors including two MVP awards. His success with the Lakers \u2014 Bryant won the first of three straight titles in just his fourth season \u2014 made him a prolific pitchman as well.\n\nBryant racked up endorsements in addition to his Adidas deal: He shilled for McDonald\ufffd\ufffds, starring in a bizarro ad where he was a late addition to a[1] peew[7]ee basketball league team. Owing to his childhood in Italy \u2014 his father, a former NBA player, played professional basketball there in the 1980s \u2014 he endorsed Nutella, a product of the Italian chocolate maker",

Simultaneously, Darren, fascinated by Crepsley's spider, Madam Octa, impulsively steals her. Before he can leave, he is forced to hide as Crepsley returns to his room. Steve arrives, begging to be made into a vampire, but Crepsley refuses after tasting Steve's blood, which he says \"tastes of evil\". When Crepsley realizes that Madam Octa has been stolen, Darren flees from the theater with Crepsley hot on his trail. He gets away only when the mysterious Mr. Tiny arrives in his limousine, accompanied by the mad Vampeneze Murlough. The latter is unimpressed with Darren,[1] dismissing him as a \"bag of blood\", but Tiny is greatly impressed, and promises to \"be in touch\" after dropping Darren off at home.\n\nThe next day, while at school Steve discovers Darren heard the conversation between Steve and Crepsley, forcing Darren to admit he overheard what Steve said to Crepsley. Steve makes Darren let him have a closer look at Madam Octa but the bell rings making Steve drop the cage allowing the spider to escape. After a brief struggle in the crowded hallway Madam Octa bites Steve and[0] escapes, leaving Steve to slowly succumb to her deadly venom in the hospital. Becoming desperate, Darren returns to the theater and begs Crepsley for help. Initially annoyed and contemptuous, Crepsley agrees only[0] if Darren becomes a half-vampire and Crepsley's personal assistant. Darren agrees, only to flee as soon as Crepsley administers an antidote to Steve. After nearly attacking his sister out of[0] bloodlust soon after, however, Darren reluctantly agrees to leave with Crepsley, who arranges it so everyone believes Darren has killed himself.\n\nAfter being buried, Darren is dug up by Crepsley, only for the both of them to be ambushed by Murlough. Crepsley fights him off and the two return to Cirque du Freak where Darren meets the snake boy, Evra Von, and[0] Rebecca, the monkey girl. Meanwhile, Steve, contemplating suicide after losing his best friend, is stopped by Tiny who offers him a chance to become a Vampaneze, telling him that Darren has already achieved his dream of being a vampire, and wasn't the loyal friend Steve believed. Steve is turned into a half-Vampeneze, and after learning that Darren has been refusing to feed, Tiny has his family kidnapped, leaving a flyer for the Cirque du Freak at Darren's former home.\n\nDarren arrives at the theater, where Murlough and Steve are waiting for him. They fight, but Darren is weak from not feeding. Crepsley arrives to fight Murlough. Rebecca frees herself, while Tiny watches from the balcony. Rebecca offers Darren some of her blood. He eventually agrees and fights with Steve using his new powers. Crepsley stabs Murlough and with his dying words Murlough declares that the truce between the two clans is broken. Steve and Darren continue to fight, but Tiny stops them and turns Murl[0]ough into[0] a Little Person. Darren asks Steve to stay, but Steve refuses, saying \"I have my destiny and you have yours.\" Steve then leaves with Tiny.\n\nDarren's family are hypnotized to[0] have forgotten what happened to them. Left by themselves, Rebecca and Darren then share a long heartfelt kiss before being interrupted by Crepsley. Crepsley gives Darren his own coffin, and Darren accepts his new life as a member of the Cirque du Freak.\n\nCast\nMain article: (List of characters from The Saga of Darren Shan)\n\n Chris Massoglia as Darren Shan\n John C.

        "Donald Trump hates New Jersey. Here's proof.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is balking at contributing federal funding to a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River -- the latest sign that Trump has little concern when New Jersey is hurt by his policy decisions.\n\nMore: NJ death penalty: These GOP lawmakers want to bring it back\n\nMore: School funding: Is former AP super Lamont Repollet the best pick to lead NJ?\n\nWith a Republican in the White House and the GOP controlling both the House and the Senate, it's to be expected that Democratic-leaning states such as New Jersey and their taxpayers are going to feel some pain, said Carl Golden, a political analyst with the Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton College.\n\nThere was a time Trump on-the-record loathed New Jersey's political leaders, but it was many years ago, Golden said -- when Trump had an Atlantic City casino empire, and he found himself going up against another powerful casino mogul, Steve Wynn, then head of Mirage Resorts, which planned to build a Vegas-style casino in the city's Marina District.\n\nMORE: Donald Trump doesn't mind trashing NJ for political gain\n\nA fight over building a tunnel connecting the Atlantic City Expressway to the marina district led Trump and Wynn to file lawsuits. Trump in 1996 vowed the tunnel was \"not going to happen'' but it was completed in 2001. \"That's when he hated everybody in New Jersey,'' Golden recalled.\n\nGolden on Monday said he's sure there's been no carryover of hard feelings.\n\nBut is Trump really capable of letting bygones be bygones? Here's where the Trump-New Jersey relationship is lately:\n\nThe Hudson River tunnel debacle\n\nA story from Bloomberg has this for a headline: \"How Trump\ufffd\ufffds Hudson Tunnel Feud\n\nThreatens the National Economy.'' It's no exaggeration.\n\n\"The current link is shot, corroded by age and chemical-tainted flood water. That\ufffd\ufffds unnerving enough for the 820,000 passengers a day traveling to New York City jobs or some other U.S.[0] Northeast destination,'' the story says.\n\nMore: Trump: Kill all federal money for Gateway tunnel\n\nMore: NJ marijuana legalization: Businesses don't need weed license to make money\n\nNo big deal for Trump. He reportedly personally asked House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis[7]., last week to drop any federal money for the[0] $30 billion project.\n\nWho suffers more than most? \"In 2014, 14 percent of Manhattan\ufffd\ufffds workforce consisted of New Jersey residents, and 8 percent of all New Jersey workers commute to Manhattan,'' the Bloomberg story says. \"The total income earned in Manhattan by New Jersey commuters is at least $33 billion annually.''\n\nFor more on the proposed Gateway project, watch the video at the top of the page. The story continues after the photo gallery below.\n\nTrump's tax bill punishes some in New Jersey\n\nTrump's tax overhaul is unpopular in New Jersey due in part because it limits the state and local tax (SALT) deduction \u2013 which Garden State homeowners had relied on to avoid paying \ufffd\ufffddouble\ufffd\ufffd on property taxes both locally and federally\u2013 to $10,000 per household. Thirteen out of 14[1] members of New Jersey\ufffd\ufffds Congressional delegation voted no on the bill, including 4 of 5 Republicans. Only Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-Ocean County, voted in favor.\n\nTrump's threat to drill, baby, drill near NJ\n\nOf late it seems the Trump administration's proposal to drill off New Jersey might be pulled back, but the U.S. Department of the Interior initially wanted to allow more than 90 percent of U.S. ocean waters to be leased by energy companies for the purpose of potentially extracting oil and gas from beneath the seabed.\n\nNew Jersey politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, made the case that drilling activity here could lead to oil spills that will harm marine life, the state's coastal economy and Shore residents' quality of life.\n\nFinally, some good news last week, with Reps. Chris Smith and MacArthur reporting that drilling exploration off New Jersey may not be a priority for the administration, and that those waters could be formally removed from consideration, pending a formal process. \"We may have dodged a major bullet,\" Smith said.\n\nBob Jordan bjordan@gannettnj.com",
        "If you talk to me more than once, chances are you will probably know about my obsession with a children\ufffd\ufffds toy product, Bionicle. For point of reference, Bionicle was a children\ufffd\ufffds toy line created by Lego at the start of the 2000\ufffd\ufffds. It featured buildable action figures and had a set of short novels to create a story to go along with the toy line \u2013 basically becoming Power Rangers, Pokemon, and/or Transformers, but with a different spin. During the first year of its run (2001) Bionicle generated over $161 Million (\u00a3100 Million) [1][0] in revenue for LEGO, and roughly the same in first years of its run. This success is a major reason why Bionicle was largely responsible for the continuation of the LEGO Company and its success today. During the 90\ufffd\ufffds LEGO had been suffering losses and were running out of time and money, and Bionicle came in to save the day.\n\nNow, if Bionicle is nothing more than a children\ufffd\ufffds toy line that begs the question, what made it so \ufffd\ufffdpopular\ufffd\ufffd or least loveable by a child who was born on the wrong[1] side of the 90\ufffd\ufffds. I will answer that question for myself, and hopefully will instill a degree of understanding to the general audience as to why I remain loyal to a dead franchise. My love of these toys stems from my early childhood. In fact this shares the timing of another one of my hobbies, pipecleaners.\n\nNow like most children, I too, had those few things that I really enjoyed and were permitted by my parents. In my case, a major part of my childhood was Bionicle. I remember I used to ask my parents all the time for them, but never was able to get ahold of many of the figures; luckily this is where pipecleaners came in. With the fuzz covered wires I could create my own action figures and doll out justice upon the evildoers. So, like any loyal fan, some of my first creations were pipecleaner versions of the actual Bionicle characters, and then I fused the pieces and pipecleaners and also created my own characters. You could say that Bionicle was my first fandom. And one could even make the argument that because of my love for these plastic representations of bio-me[7]chanical beings I became a writer.\n\nWith Bionicle kick starting the process, I quickly amassed several legions of pipecleaner creations, many of whom were reminiscent of the heroes themselves (the Toa). I quickly began to create stories in my mind where the Toa would fight alongside the heroes of another franchise to defeat a great evil. Those in turn evolved into stories featuring my own[3] characters and my own[0] worlds \u2013 simple as I was merely a child then. I credit a great[0] deal of my creativity and storytelling skill to these great, wonderful, and deep Biological Chronicle based beings.\n\nI have many thanks to give to my first fandom. The great Bionicles of the days past are no more and we are left with nothing but memories. I give thanks to the Bionicle series for giving me a great childhood where I believed in heroes. I thank you for the all the good times and stories I have had with you and the plastic figure I still own. I thank you for inspiring me in that early stage of my life to create and tell stories and without that inspiration I might not have written this piece this day. I also have a practical use for my love of Bionicle.[1] Even my online handle[2], gamer tag, and partial pseudonym are a throwback to Bionicle. The first few stories in the Bionicle Universe feature a character known as the Chronicler, and I have taken that title upon myself in my work to[4] honor my roots and give tribute to the greatness of my childhood fandom.\n\nOn my mission, when I was assigned to the Northern Lights Samoan ward, I was also instructed to begin learning the Samoan language. I found that as I learned, the pronunciation of the words, rhythm and air of the language closely mirrored my childhood fandom. ([0]The names of the characters and places in Bionicle are based on the Polynesian Languages). Who knew that after so many years, my love for the toys of my childhood would help me in the real world to partially learn and speak a new language? More than that, it helped me stay sane and keep a grasp on reality. As I had previously explained, the stress of serving a mission is intense and sometimes hard to deal with, and Bionicle helped me get through that. Even though it had originally been canceled in 2010, it was brought back in 2015 for a two year run. 2015 and 2016 would see the release of the Second Generation Bionicles. Almost as if it was brought back for me and my mission, it saw the light of day once more. It was glorious, and I was able to enjoy building these",
        "Wednesday, 2 August 2017\n\nSix Reason For Late Periods To More Difficult Girls/Women (Other than Pregnancy)\n\nPeriods :-\n\nA Periods is the a part of the menstrual cycle while a female bleeds from her vagina for some days. For maximum girls this happens each twenty eight(28) days or so, but it's common for intervals to start ultimately than this, ranging from day twenty four(24) to thirty five(35).\n\nSix Reason For Late Periods :-\n\nThere are a few other factors that you can blame on your missing or delayed intervals. Gynaecologist Dr Arundhati Dhar[7] tells you what may be the purpose of delayed intervals.\n\n\u25cf Stress :- Hypothalamus, a place to your brain in which quite a few hormones on your durations are regulated gets affected because of pressure. So in case you are dealing with a smash-[0]up or demise within the circle of relatives or another lifestyles event, the pressure will be the purpose of your overdue length or overlooked duration.\n\n\u25cf Thyroid Disorder :- A thyroid imbalance whether it's far hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can postpone your durations. So in case you word any[0] symptom of thyroid sickness, be sure to check along with your health practitioner.\n\n\u25cf Chronic Disease :- Any chronic contamination like Celiac ailment ([0]characterised by lactose intolerance) that is left undiagnosed or untreated can effect the functioning of your trendy bodily systems and bring about not on time periods.\n\n\u25cf Birth Control Pills :- Missing or overdue duration can also be the aspect effect of a start manipulate tablet that you have taken. it is able to additionally be a end result of other strategies like hormonal IUDs, implants or maybe photographs.\n\n\u25cf Premature Menopause :- This isn't always very common, but some women underneath 40 have early menopause which is likewise called a untimely ovarian failure. in conjunction with lacking duration signs of premature menopause consist of night time sweats, hot flashes and vaginal dryness.\n\nPCOS: PCOS, a hormonal imbalance can cause abnormal intervals. Hair boom on face and chest, ability fertility issues and issue in dropping weight are some of the alternative signs and symptoms of PCOS.",
        "Suppose you want to build something \u2014 a skyscraper or a spacecraft, a computer or a car, a water bottle or a wristwatch.\n\nYou\ufffd\ufffdll need materials to make that product, and you\ufffd\ufffdll need to choose the best materials for the job. For instance, you\ufffd\ufffdll want lightweight materials for a spacecraft so that you can afford to propel it out of Earth\ufffd\ufffds gravity. But if it will come back to Earth, it also needs to withstand the heat of re-entry. How do you find the right material to build the best product? ASU engineers are turning the typical trial-and-error process on its head. Download Full Image\n\nHow do you find the right material to suit your needs? Generally, it takes a lot of trial and error. You make a material and you test it in a lab. Crush it. Cook it. Stretch it. Chill it. Then do it over and over and over again.\n\nIt is a time-consuming and expensive process. And although you\ufffd\ufffdll probably find a material that suits your purpose, it might not be the best possible material for the job.\n\nThat\ufffd\ufffds why a group of researchers at Arizona State University are working to flip the process on its head. Instead of making a material and then finding out what it can do, they are starting from the end \u2014 deciding what properties a material should have and then designing the material to have those traits. These could range from strength to flexibility to electrical conductivity and more.\n\nA need for structure\n\n\ufffd\ufffdWe already have performance in mind. So we need to ask ourselves, what are the things you can change, what can you play with to give you this performance? The thing that we play with is the material microstructure,\ufffd\ufffd said Yang Jiao, an assistant professor in ASU\ufffd\ufffds School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy (SEMTE).\n\nFor example, if you look at a piece of metal, it appears to be one uniform material. But most metals are alloys made from two or more elements, such as copper and aluminum.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdYou melt them together, stir and cool again. As you cool it, the distribution of the components will be different in different parts of the metal,\ufffd\ufffd Jiao said.\n\nAt high temperatures, copper and aluminum mix together evenly, but as they cool the copper forms clusters. The differences are not visible to the naked eye, but they can be seen under a microscope. This structure, with its clusters of copper, affects the properties of the material.\n\nThink about building a house out of bricks. If you just stack bricks on top of each other in side-by-side columns, your house will not be very strong. But if you stagger the bricks, the structure will be much stronger.\n\nA metal alloy that forms clumps of one of its elements after heating and cooling is like a wall made of bricks stacked directly over one another, in columns (left). This results in a wall that is structurally weaker than one in which the bricks are staggered.\n\nIt\ufffd\ufffds easy to see how staggered bricks make a stronger wall. It\ufffd\ufffds much harder to figure out how the structure of a titanium alloy helps it withstand repeated stresses without breaking \u2014 also known as fatigue strength. This is the challenge that Jiao is confronting with his colleagues in SEMTE, Yi \ufffd\ufffdMax\ufffd\ufffd Ren and Yongming Liu.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdYou have a target property \u2014 I want a fracture strength as high as possible. Then what kind of microstructure will achieve that? Instead of evaluating existing materials, I want to find the structure that will match the property,\ufffd\ufffd said Ren, an assistant professor who studies design optimization.\n\nMaking a connection\n\nScientists can figure out the microstructure of a material that already exists. Jiao develops computer simulations that can analyze that microstructure and determine what properties it will have. The simulations are based on data from experimental testing.\n\nWhat he can\ufffd\ufffdt do, yet, is go in reverse. The computer simulation can say, \ufffd\ufffdThis structure will give you this property, and that structure will give you that property.\ufffd\ufffd But it doesn\ufffd\ufffdt explain why. So the researchers don\ufffd\ufffdt know what specific characteristics of a structure cause it to have the properties it does.\n\nThis is where Ren\ufffd\ufffds expertise comes in. He is developing software to help the computer identify which features of a microstructure are important to specific properties. He is drawing on deep learning technologies, a branch of artificial intelligence in which software learns to recognize patterns. This is how Facebook recognizes your friends in a photograph and how Amazon makes personalized recommendations.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdWe want the machine to learn by itself what structural features influence a material property,\ufffd\ufffd he said.\n\nThe computer will analyze images of different microstructures pixel by[7] pixel",

        "Vox Humana Ted Morrissey\n\nHer brother Harry hadn\ufffd\ufffdt written from[0] Korea for more than a year, or at least none of his letters got through. Then out of the blue he called, said he was in South Carolina, he was taking a train, then a bus and he\ufffd\ufffdd be in Crawford at the Trailways terminal in three days: Could Annette or Tim pick him up? Tim and the car had been gone for three weeks and two days at that point. It was too complicated to explain over[1] the phone, especially long distance, so Annette said she would see her brother in Crawford. It required her taking a day off from school and borrowing Carl Reynolds\ufffd\ufffds Ford, but she managed it. She arrived at the bus terminal a few minutes late but suspected the bus would be even later. However, she\ufffd\ufffdd only stepped from the car when she spotted Harry on a[0] bench in front of the station, which also sat vacant and lonely. Harry was lost in his own thoughts and didn\ufffd\ufffdt notice her right[2] away, which gave Annette a few moments to look at her brother and truly see him, almost the way a stranger might take him in. He was thin, perhaps even wiry beneath clothes that looked like hand-me-downs from an older and somewhat larger brother, nonexistent. His hair was brown with[2]\u2014was[0] it possible?\u2014[0]the beginning streaks of white at his temples. It\ufffd\ufffdd been cut short but that was weeks ago and the neat haircut had been growing of its own accord. Trousers of summer-weight wool, soon to be unquestionably out of season; a cotton shirt with a button-down collar, un[0]buttoned, and zippered jacket, unzipped, also soon to be too light for the time of year. His shoes may[1] have been new but definitely in need of an energetic polishing. Harry was smoking, something he must\ufffd\ufffdve picked up in the service. More accurately, he was watching the lit cigarette between his fingers, as if a complicated thing which warranted careful study. Annette was reluctant to interrupt his seemingly peaceful contemplation, but Harry must\ufffd\ufffdve sensed her presence, or someone\ufffd\ufffds, and he looked up. Sis, he said, not so much in greeting as in practicing. He hadn\ufffd\ufffdt seen his sister in[2] nearly five years, and perhaps with all that had transpired in the intervening years he needed a sort of rehearsal to reprise his role as kid brother. Look at you, said Annette kissing him on the cheek, rough with stubble. You\ufffd\ufffdre so skinny. The scent of his cigarette elicited a recollection of Tim, who would smoke after dinner, and the memory was unpleasant and unwelcome. The Army isn\ufffd\ufffdt known for its haute cuisine. Quite the opposite. He exhaled a final breath of smoke and stepped on the butt with the toe of his shoe. The car\ufffd\ufffds just over here. He slung an[0] army-green duffel over his shoulder and picked up a medium-size suitcase, old-fashioned, with leather straps\u2014his only possessions it would seem. On the drive back Annette tried to make small talk, which in[7] itself felt strange, to speak to her brother as she would a virtual stranger, but Harry\ufffd\ufffds responses were perfunctory at best. Annette wondered if he was upset to be in the passenger seat. Maybe he\ufffd\ufffdd become one of those men who felt it was a fact of[8] biology that the male of the species should always take the wheel. Tim believed it. After a while, Annette decided her brother\ufffd\ufffds taciturnity was more a matter of his preferring quiet. So she left him to his own thoughts, and he seemed content to watch the old familiar countryside, rushing past in its early orange hues, the fields dotted here and there with farm animals. You can smoke if you like\u2014probably best to roll down the window. Harry took out his pack of Chesterfields. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nAnnette had only begun to use the spare bedroom as a what-not room\u2014she\ufffd\ufffdd set up her ironing-board, for example\u2014so it was easy enough to prepare for Harry\ufffd\ufffds arrival when he called. He hadn\ufffd\ufffdt asked to stay but she assumed, and apparently correctly. He didn\ufffd\ufffdt inquire about Tim, either, or about anything for that matter. Annette imagined Tim\ufffd\ufffds absence from her life was abundantly clear. Harry put away his few things almost as soon as they got back, and easy as that they were roommates. Annette wondered if she should have a welcome-home party for Harry, but growing up he\ufffd\ufffdd had few close friends, and fewer still remained in the village.

        "Rainbows of brightly colored computer cases were a common sight at this\nyear's Comdex.\n\nI am on my way to my first Comdex show, and this is my first trip\nto Las Vegas.\nI have been an assistant editor at\nMacworld\nfor three months. And here\nI am, minutes from the show floor, arguing with my cab driver, defending the\nfact that colored computers are not girly. I suddenly become painfully aware\nof the fact that I am wearing an iMac-blueberry blue dress. I match\nmy G3 desktop\nperfectly. This is not on purpose, and I'm about to tell him so, but I stop\nmyself.\n\n\"Men, they don't care about that kind of stuff,\" he says. \"[1]I\nmean, a pink computer?! You've got to be kidding.\" He shakes his\nhead.\n\n\"Actually, a lot of men seem to like the iMac,\" I say. I shut my\nmouth about[0] the iBook.\n\n\"Yeah,[1] right,\" he grumbles, but I detect a note of[8] uncertainty.\n\n\"Really,\" I say. \"They even came out with a computer that's\ntransparent. The men seem to love it.\"\n\n\"A clear computer, shit,\" he says. \"[0]I mean, it's not like it\nworks any different, right? Who cares what it looks like?\" He throws his\nshoulders back in a little manly-man gesture. But at this point, I can tell\nhe's intrigued.\n\nEupa's angel and devil speakers are sooooo cuuuuute!\n\nI arrive at the show. The floor is filled with manly men. Manly men typing\non transparent keyboards; manly men handling blue, green, purple, and orange\nmice; manly men getting visibly excited by yellow, blue, and even\npink computer\ncases. But these computers aren't Macs, so it's okay.\n\n\"This is a PC company, sweetheart,\" a manly booth man tells me when\nI inquire whether his translucent mauve USB mouse is\nMac-compatible. He emphasizes\n\"PC,\" as in \"PC, a real computer.\" This is a phrase I'll\nhere often at Comdex. \"We make PC products,\" he repeats. \"But\naren't they pretty?\"\n\n\"I call them iMac-alikes,\" the man says with a wink. Personally,\nI call them cease-and-desist orders, but I return his wink with[0] a chuckle and\nshuffle on down the aisle.\n\nI am at the Sands Convention Center, where the OEMs (Original\nEquipment Manufacturers\nto the uninitiated) show their stuff. And this year, it's all about color and\nfun. Intel has a booth right outside the floor, and it's filled\nwith space-age\ninspired computers. A Taiwanese company called Eupa has a pair of\nspeakers designed\nto look like an angel and a devil. Cute. But most of the designs\nseem to spring\ndirectly from the Apple lineage, even using the exact same colors (see \"\nSeparated at Birth.\" The strange thing is, while men complain\nabout girly iMac colors and iBooks they say look like purses, it seems okay\nfor them to like a colored PC, and they're all acting like this is the latest\nthing. And here I[0] thought color was last year's news.\n\nAll of a sudden I'm reminded of the days before Windows, the days\nwhen PC-heads\nmocked the Mac OS. \"Aw,[1] how cute,\" they'd say mockingly, \"the\nlittle files actually look like little file folders.\" They'd turn back\nto their PCs, secure with the notion that typing obscure lines of[1] code like\n\"\n\nC:>dir /s /w | more\n\n\" made them worthy of The Machine.\nAnd then Windows came out, and suddenly[0] little file folders actually made the\ncomputer easier to use and that was okay. And now colored PCs are here, and\nit's okay to touch a purple mouse.",
        "People complain about negative advertising, but it never goes away. That's because it works.\n\nPayPal has taken this conventional wisdom to heart, launching an attack ad against its latest and most formidable competitor, Apple Pay, before the new service even lands in the hands of consumers. Appearing in multiple newspapers, the full-page spread is meant to sow distrust in Apple by reminding the world of this month's massive iCloud celebrity selfie hack.\n\nPayPal\n\nThe ad may or may[0] not be fair. It might not even have the desired effect. But it indisputably shows what happens when Apple muscles into a new market: the incumbents immediately become the underdogs. And how they react becomes a measure of how powerful Apple really is. In the case of the payments business, PayPal has clear reason to be worried.\n\nWhen Microsoft made Internet Explorer the default Windows web browser, it quickly shot to the top of the list of most popular browsers, where it stayed for years, despite the existence of other, arguably better browsers that came before it. Apple has the power to do the same for payments with Apple Pay, but with notable differences that put it in an even better position than Microsoft. First, Apple controls the hardware as well as the software. Second, Apple's demonstrated design chops suggest a company that will never let its products sink into the kind of user-experience decrepitude that sank IE.\n\nThe analogy also breaks down a bit around the sheer duration of PayPal's incumbency. PayPal has been synonymous with online payments for more than a decade, while the web was still in its infancy when IE came out. Integrating Apple Pay across the online and offline retail worlds will take time. PayPal users wouldn't be able to make any kind of full-time switch even if they wanted to go all[0]-Apple. PayPal has reason to be hopeful. But in the long run, the threat is real.\n\nApple Isn't the Other\n\nIf any company has the power to hasten its own ubiquity, it's Apple. Apple Pay will spread quickly once the iPhone 6[0] and iOS 8 are released this week[0]. Even PayPal's own Braintree division has released a way for developers to integrate Apple Pay into their online apps. And Apple is restricting the use of the iPhone 6's NFC chip to Apple Pay, which means PayPal won't be able to take advantage of the[0] new phones' power to act as in-store credit card substitutes.\n\nThose factors leave PayPal with[2] little choice but to seek to undermine Apple's advantages through marketing. The new PayPal ad tries to sound a populist note: \"We the people want our money safer than our selfies.\" Aiming at Apple's apparent negligence in locking down iCloud is the obvious target. If Apple can't be trusted with photos, can it really be trusted with credit card numbers?\n\nA crucial difference, however, appears to be that Apple Pay's tokenization system doesn't appear to store a user's credit card number at all, locally or online, once that card is scanned. If nothing else, that makes Apple Pay more secure than physical credit cards themselves.\n\nEven granting that Apple has yet to make up the trust deficit the iCloud hack incurred, however, portraying Apple as the overlord aligned against the \"people\"[5] seems unlikely to succeed. In polls, Apple consistently ranks near the top among the world's most trusted and admired brands. And Apple users relate to their devices. However much control they really have, people who carry their iPhones everywhere they go feel like the devices belong to them. Apple isn't the Other.[8] Apple is[0] what's in your pocket, a digital extension of yourself.\n\nThe Omnivore Dilemma\n\nThat closeness users feel to Apple hints at a broader problem for PayPal: it's a niche platform, while Apple is an omnivore. Apple has the power to try to absorb nearly any function or feature into itself. To escape Apple's predations, PayPal could make itself another omnivore's prey.\n\nLast week, trading in PayPal parent company eBay's shares spiked on rumors Google planned to buy a major stake in the company, a rumor eBay quickly shot down. But a Google acquisition might not be such a bad thing for PayPal, especially if Google decided to make it the Apple Pay of Android. In mobile, Google's reach is much broader than Apple's, if less focused. And for Google, PayPal is already a much more recognized brand than any of Google's own payment efforts.\n\nGoing with Google, another corporate behemoth, wouldn't exactly make PayPal look more populist. But when you're up against Apple, it's one of the moves most likely to help you stay popular.",
        "By itself, 5-HTP isn\ufffd\ufffdt very effective at relieving opiate withdrawal symptoms, however, when it\ufffd\ufffds taken with other natural supplements, the results can be SIMPLY AMAZING (more on this a little later). \ufffd\ufffd\n\n5-HTP Overview\n\n5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a naturally occurring amino acid and chemical precursor in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin from tryptophan.\n\n5-HTP is a chemical by-product of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is also produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant (Griff[4]onia simplicifolia).\n\n5-HTP works in the brain and central nervous system (CNS) by increasing the production of the chemical serotonin.Serotonin can affect:\n\nSleep\n\nAppet[8]ite\n\nTemperature\n\nSexual behavior\n\nPain sensation\n\nSince 5-HTP increases the synthesis of serotonin, it is used for many conditions where serotonin is believed to play an important role.\n\nHere are just a few common examples:\n\nInsomnia\n\nAnxiety\n\nMigraines\n\nPMS\n\nObesity\n\nDepression\n\nOpiate withdrawal\n\nPrescription-Strength Supplement\n\n5-HTP is sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement in the US, Canada, and the UK for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid.\n\nIt is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under various trade names. Thus, using 5-HTP is an inexpensive and powerful way to increase serotonin quickly and naturally\u2026and higher levels of serotonin can directly lead to feelings of being \ufffd\ufffdemotionally relaxed\ufffd\ufffd and content.\n\nMy Experience Using 5-HTP\n\nThough I never used 5-HTP for opiate withdrawal, I did use the dietary supplement for a few weeks when I was 29 years old. I was living in upstate New York, it was the middle of winter, and the lack of sunshine was starting to affect my mood negatively.\n\nI lived in Southern California for 27 years before moving to New York, so I wasn\ufffd\ufffdt used to going 30 days in a row without warm sunshine!\n\nAnyways, long story short, a friend of[6] mine told me he was enjoying the benefits of supplementing with 5-HTP for his depression.\n\nI wasn\ufffd\ufffdt depressed, but I was close to it, and I QUICKLY went to the store and bought the same brand and dosage of 5-HTP that he was using.\n\nThe 5-HTP worked very well at boosting my serotonin and enhancing my mood.\n\nHowever, after a few weeks, I wasn\ufffd\ufffdt receiving the same benefits, and it started to give me nausea (a common side effect). Luckily spring was just around the corner, and I made it out of winter just fine.\n\n5-HTP Precautions\n\nIf you\ufffd\ufffdve liked what you\ufffd\ufffdve read about 5-HTP so far, then you may be considering using 5-HTP for opiate withdrawal. If you\ufffd\ufffdre looking for a natural supplement to reduce withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression,pain, and insomnia, then 5-HTP might be able to help.\n\nHowever, 5-HTP reacts with certain medications, conditions, etc., so it\ufffd\ufffds very important that you are aware of the possible dangers of using 5-HTP for opiate withdrawal.\n\nBefore you decide to use 5-HTP for opiate withdrawal, please review the following links:\n\nHow To Use 5-HTP For Opiate Withdrawal\n\nTo use 5-HTP for opiate withdrawal, it\ufffd\ufffds really as simple as buying the supplement and swallowing a few pills per day. There are many different 5-HTP products to choose from, and I recommend[0] purchasing something that is very high-quality since there are a lot of bogus supplement companies out there nowadays. The product I like the best is 5-HTP Gold.\n\nTo use 5-HTP for opiate withdrawal, please review the following guidelines:\n\nUse a high-quality 5-HTP supplement.\n\n5-HTP is best absorbed when taken on an empty stomach.\n\nTake low dosages of 100 mg during the day.\n\nAt nighttime 30 minutes before bed take up to 300 mg to help induce sleep.\n\nMost Powerful Way To Use 5-HTP For Opiate Withdrawal\n\nUsing 5-HTP for opiate withdrawal helps, but it only relieves a small portion of the symptoms.

        "Predicted multiple selected reaction monitoring to screen activated drug-mediated modifications on human serum albumin.\nMetabolic activation of drugs frequently generates electrophilic products that may undergo covalent binding to biological macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA. The resulting covalent adducts are of considerable concern in drug discovery and development. Several strategies for assessing the potential risks of candidate drugs have been reported. Of these, glutathione trapping is the most commonly used method together with mass spectrometry. Furthermore, drug-mediated protein modifications have been studied using serum albumin and CYP enzymes to clarify target amino acids and mechanism-based inhibition, respectively. In this article, we introduce a practical way to screen drug-mediated protein modifications. The method, referred to as \"predicted multiple selected reaction monitoring,\" is based on the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) strategy, but targets all possible chemically modified tryptic peptides. The creation of SRM lists may require patience; however, this strategy could facilitate more sensitive screening compared with the common strategy of data-dependent product ion scanning. Ketopro[9]fen-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (equivalent to glucuronide) and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) were allowed to react with human serum albumin as a model experiment. Using this strategy, 11 ketopro[3]fen-adduction sites (at Lys(137, 195, 199, 212, 351, 402, 432, 436, 525, 536, and 541)) and 1 NAPQI-adduction site (at Cys(34)) were easily identified.",
        "REVIEW: Poor Lou finds himself in the middle of his own ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 in this week's amazing episode of Fargo. It's incredible how Noah Hawley's show manages to outdo itself each and every week, and after last week's tense, bloody installment I wasn't at all sure this week's episode would be able to measure up. I shouldn't have under-estimated Hawley, as this week's episode might just be the best so far.\n\nWhile these kinds of stand-off, bottle episodes are nothing new (the PRECINCT 13 model far predates that film \u2013 going back to the classic westerns that influenced John Carpenter), what is unique about the way Hawley's show handled this formula. Specifically, how he lets the feeling of dread mount throughout the episode but then manages to have it come to an unexpectedly non-violent conclusion, which the audience will no doubt find a relief, as Lou, Ted Danson's Sherrif and the rest of the Luverne PD are such a likable crew you don't want to see any of them buy the farm.\n\nWhile the episode comes to a peaceful end, Lou's dealing with the Gerhardt clan will no doubt have a violent end, especially once Jeffrey Donovan's psycho Dodd gets involved, with him being sidelined by a bout with Kirsten Dunst's surprisingly capable Peggy.\n\nThere's so much to enjoy in this episode, with Ted Danson and Nick Offerman getting loads of screen-time this week. While Danson's sheriff always seemed a tad simple, he displays some of the sharpness his grand-daughter Molly possesses in season one, with him having a great exchange with Peggy where he tries to fathom why she didn't just come clean the moment she hit Rye, and clues her-in on the grim fate that now awaits her and Ed.\n\nOfferman fares even better. While his whiskered, big-talking Carl has seemed like a bit of a joke so far, here he's revealed to be anything but, with him being roused from a drunken night out to work as Ed's attorney. His unexpectedly silver-tongued knowledge of the law comes in handy with him able to talk-out a peaceful solution with the Gerhardts, giving him something to brag about at the next lodge meeting (an end-credits treat).\n\nAs always, Fargo just keeps getting better and better. This was one hell of a good episode \u2013 maybe the best so far, and amazingly only one person died this week (a Gerhardt shooter accidentally plugged by Dodd). Oh \u2013 and as a treat for Coen Bros fans, we get cool seventies version of \ufffd\ufffdA Man of[10] Constant Sorrow\ufffd\ufffd - which was famously featured in O BR[4]OTHER WHERE ART THOU. The perfect end to a perfect episode."
