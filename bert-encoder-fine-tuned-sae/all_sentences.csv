Introduction {#sec:hpr}
============

Tanno equation and Main result
------------------------------

Let $(M,g,J)$ be a pseudo-Riemannian Kähler manifold of real dimension $2n$."
"During the whole paper, we are using tensor notation, for example $T^{i_{1}...i_{p}}_{j_{1}...j_{q},k}$ means covariant differentiation of the tensor $T^{i_{1}...i_{p}}_{j_{1}...j_{q}}$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of $g$."
"If $\omega_{i}$ is a $1$-form on $M$, then $\bar{\omega}_{i}=J^{\alpha}_{i}\omega_{\alpha}$."
"Moreover, the Kählerian $2$-form is denoted by the symbol $J_{ij}=g_{i\alpha}J^{\alpha}_{j}$."
"We are interested in the question, if $(M,g,J)$ allows the existence of a non-constant solution $f$ of the equation $$\begin{aligned}
f_{,ijk}+c(2f_{,k}g_{ij}+f_{,i}g_{jk}+f_{,j}g_{ik}-\bar{f}_{,i}J_{jk}-\bar{f}_{,j}J_{ik})=0\label{eq:tanno}\end{aligned}$$ Originally this equation appeared first in spectral geometry, see [@Tanno1978]."
"Let $(\mathbb{C}P(n),g_{FS})$ be the complex projective space with Fubini-Study metric $g_{FS}$ of constant holomorphic sectional curvature equal to $1$."
"Then, the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian to the first eigenvalue $-(n+1)$ satisfy with $c=\frac{1}{4}$."
"Conversely, contracting with $g^{ij}$ shows that $(\Delta f)_{,k}=-4c(n+1)f_{,k}$, hence $$\Delta(f+C)=-4c(n+1)(f+C)$$ for any solution $f$ of and some constant $C$."
"The goal of this paper is to give a proof of the following Theorem:

\[thm:main\] Let $f$ be a non-constant smooth function on a closed, connected pseudo-Riemannian Kähler manifold $(M^{2n},g,J)$ such that the equation (\[eq:tanno\]) is fulfilled for some constant $c$."
"Then $c\neq 0$ and $(M^{2n}, 4cg, J)$ can be finitely covered by $(\mathbb{C}P(n), g_{FS}, J_{standard})$."
"In particular we obtain that on a closed, connected Kähler manifold $(M,g,J)$ such that $Cg$ is not positively definite for any constant $C\neq 0$, any solution of is necessarily a constant."
"If we assume in addition lightlike completeness, there is a simple and short proof of this statement."
"Indeed, let $f$ be a solution of equation and let $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow M$ be a lightlike geodesic."
"Restricting to $\gamma$ yields the ordinary differential equation $f'''(t)=0$, where $f(t)=f(\gamma(t))$."
The general solution $f(t)=At^{2}+Bt+C$ must have vanishing constants $A$ and $B$ since $\gamma$ is complete and $f$ is bounded on the closed manifold $M$.
We obtain that each solution $f$ of equation is constant along any lightlike geodesic.
"Since two arbitrary points can be connected by a broken lightlike geodesic, we obtain that all solutions of are constant."
"Theorem \[thm:main\] generalises this result to the case of a closed, connected lightlike incomplete manifold."
Theorem \[thm:main\] was proven in [@Tanno1978] for positively definite $g$ and $c>0$.
In this case it is sufficient to require that the manifold is complete.
In  [@HiramatuK] it was proven that the equation with positively definite $g$ on a closed manifold can not have non-constant solutions for $c\leq  0$.
"The Riemannian analogue: Gallot-Tanno equation
----------------------------------------------

Let us recall that the equation (\[eq:tanno\]) was introduced in [@Tanno1978] as “Kählerization” of $$\begin{aligned}
f_{,ijk}+c(2f_{,k} \cdot g_{ij}+ f_{,i} g_{j k} + f_{,j} g_{i k})=0\label{eq:GallotTanno}\end{aligned}$$ As its Kählerian analogue , this equation has its origin in spectral geometry: Consider the Laplacian on the sphere $S^{n}$ of constant sectional curvature equal to $1$."
"Then the eigenfunctions corresponding to the second eigenvalue $-2(n+1)$ satisfy with $c=1$, see [@Tanno1978; @Gallot1979]."
"Moreover, this equation appeared independently in many other parts of differential geometry."
"It is known that a non-constant solution of on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ implies the decomposability of the cone $(M'=\mathbb{R}_{>0}\times M,g'=dr^{2}+r^{2}g)$ (decomposability means that $(M',g')$ locally looks like a product manifold), see [@Gallot1979]."
In [@Mounoud2010; @Matveev2010] it was shown that this remains to be true in the pseudo-Riemannian situation for a cone over a closed manifold.
"Furthermore, equation is related to conformal and projective differential geometry (see [@Hiramatu; @Tanno1978] and [@Matveev2010; @Mounoud2010] for references)."
"The classical result dealing with equation states that on a complete, connected Riemannian manifold, the existence of a non-constant solution of with $c>0$ implies that the manifold can be covered by the euclidean sphere $S^{n}$."
"This was proven by Gallot and Tanno independently, see [@Tanno1978; @Gallot1979]."
"Recently, this result was generalised to the pseudo-Riemannian situation under the additional assumption that the manifold is closed, see [@Mounoud2010; @Cortes2009]."
"For non-closed manifolds, generalisations of the classical result of Gallot and Tanno for metrics with arbitrary signature where discussed in more detail in [@Cortes2009]."
"Organisation of the paper
-------------------------

The goal of this paper is to give a proof of Theorem \[thm:main\]."
In Section \[sec:c=0\] we consider the case when the constant $c$ in the equation (\[eq:tanno\]) is equal to zero.
"We show that there are no non-constant solutions of (\[eq:tanno\]) with $c=0$ on a closed, connected manifold."
The relation between non-constant solutions of and holomorph-projective geometry (the Kählerian analogue of projective geometry) will be shown in Section \[sec:hpro\].
"Given a solution of (\[eq:tanno\]), we can construct a solution of a linear PDE system which appears in the theory of holomorph-projectively equivalent Kähler metrics."
"Going a step further, in Section \[sec:proj\] we asign to each solution of a $(1,1)$-tensor on $\widehat{M}:=\mathbb{R}^{2}\times M$."
The family of tensors constructed in this way is invariant with respect to the operation of real polynomials on endomorphisms of the tangent bundle $T\widehat{M}$.
"This fact allows us to find special solutions of such that the corresponding $(1,1)$-tensor acts as a non-trivial projector on $T\widehat{M}$."
"Using such a solution, the final goal of this Section is to show that the metric $g$ is Riemannian up to multiplication with a constant."
The last step in the proof of Theorem \[thm:main\] is an application of the Theorem proven by Tanno for positive-definite $g$ and will be done in Section \[sec:proof\].
"The case when $c=0$ {#sec:c=0}
===================

Let us now treat the case when the constant $c$ in the equation (\[eq:tanno\]) is equal to zero."
"We show

\[thm:c=0\] Let $(M,g,J)$ be a closed, connected pseudo-Riemannian Kähler manifold and $f$ a solution of $f_{,ijk}=0$."
Then $f$ is a constant.
Let $p$ and $q$ be points of $M$ where $f$ takes its maximum and minimum value respectively.
"Then $f_{,i}(p)=f_{,i}(q)=0$ and the hessian satisfies $f_{,ij}(p)\leq 0$ and $f_{,ij}(q)\geq 0$."
"By assumption $f_{,ij}$ is parallel."
"It follows that $f_{,ij}=0$ implying that $f_{,i}$ is parallel."
"Since $f_{,i}(p)=$ we obtain that $f_{,i}=0$ on the whole of $M$, hence $f$ is a constant."
"Solutions of (\[eq:tanno\]) correspond to solutions of Frobenius system {#sec:hpro}
=======================================================================

Let $f$ be a non-constant solution of equation  on a closed, connected manifold $M$."
By Theorem \[thm:c=0\] we obtain $c\ne 0$.
The constant $c$ can therefore be included in the metric $g$ without changing the Levi-Civita connection.
"For simplicity, we denote the new metric again with the symbol $g$, hence $f$ satisfies equation (\[eq:tanno\]) with $c=1$."
"Consider the symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $a_{ij}$ and the function $\mu$ defined by $$\begin{gathered}
  a_{ij}:=-f_{,ij}-2fg_{ij}\mbox{ and }\mu:=-2f\label{eq:def}\end{gathered}$$ Then we obtain that the following linear system of PDE‘s is satisfied: $$\begin{gathered}
    \label{eq:system}
    \begin{array}{c}
      a_{i j,k}=f_i g_{j k} + f_j g_{i k}-\bar{f}_i J_{jk}-\bar{f}_j J_{ik}\\
      f_{i,j}=\mu g_{i j}-a_{i j},\\
      \mu_{,i}=-2f_i
    \end{array}
  \end{gathered}$$ Indeed, covariantly differentiating $a_{ij}=-f_{,ij}-2 f g_{ij}$ and substituting yields $$\begin{aligned}
  a_{ij,k}&=-f_{,ijk}-2 f_{,k} g_{ij}=2 f_{,k} \cdot g_{ij}+ f_{,i} g_{j k} +
    f_{,j} g_{i k} - \bar{f}_{,i}J_{jk}-\bar{f}_{,j}J_{ik} -2 f_{,k}
    g_{ij}\nonumber\\
    &=f_{,i} g_{j k}+f_{,j} g_{i k}-\bar{f}_{,i}J_{jk}-\bar{f}_{,j}J_{ik},\nonumber\end{aligned}$$ which is the first equation in ."
The second and third equations of are equivalent to the definition .
"\[rem:hpro\] The first equation $$\begin{aligned}
 a_{i j,k}=f_i g_{j k} + f_j g_{i k}-\bar{f}_i J_{jk}-\bar{f}_j J_{ik}\label{eq:main}\end{aligned}$$ in is the main equation in holomorph-projective geometry, see for example [@Sin2; @DomMik1978] or [@Mikes] for a survey on this topic."
Two Kähler metrics $g$ and $\bar{g}$ are said to be *holomorph-projectively equivalent* if their holomorphically-planar curves coincide.
"Recall that a curve $\gamma:I\rightarrow M$ is called *holomorphically-planar* with respect to the Kähler metric $g$ if there are functions $\alpha,\beta:I\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that $\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}\dot{\gamma}=\alpha \dot{\gamma}+\beta J\dot{\gamma}$ is satisfied, see [@Otsuki1954; @Tashiro1956]."
"The importance of equation is due to the fact, that the solutions $(a_{ij},f_{i})$ of , such that $a_{ij}$ is symmetric and hermitian, are in $1:1$ correspondence with metrics $\bar{g}$ beeing holomorph-projectively equivalent to $g$."
"\[rem:hpro2\] We want to mention that the $1$-form $f_{i}$ corresponding to a solution $(a_{ij},f_{i})$ of always is the differential of a function."
"Indeed, contracting equation with $g^{ij}$ shows that $f_{i}=\frac{1}{4}a^{\alpha}_{\alpha,i}$, in particular $f_{i,j}=f_{j,i}$."
"Let us note that the construction is invertible: If there is a solution $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ of (\[eq:system\]) we can use the equations in (\[eq:system\]) to show that $\mu$ always constitutes a solution of equation (\[eq:tanno\]) with $c=1$."
"Indeed, $$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{,ijk}&\overset{\mbox{\tiny\eqref{eq:system}}}{=}\nabla_{k}(-2f_{i,j})\overset{\mbox{\tiny\eqref{eq:system}}}{=}\nabla_{k}(-2\mu \tilde{g}_{ij}+2a_{ij})\nonumber\\
&=-2\mu_{,k} \tilde{g}_{ij}+2a_{ij,k}\overset{\mbox{\tiny\eqref{eq:system}}}{=}-2\mu_{,k} \tilde{g}_{ij}+2f_{i}\tilde{g}_{ik}+2f_{j}\tilde{g}_{jk}-2\bar{f}_{i}\tilde{J}_{jk}-2\bar{f}_{j}\tilde{J}_{ik}\nonumber\\
&\overset{\mbox{\tiny\eqref{eq:system}}}{=}-2\mu_{,k} \tilde{g}_{ij}-\mu_{,i}\tilde{g}_{ik}-\mu_{,j}\tilde{g}_{jk}+\bar{\mu}_{,i}\tilde{J}_{jk}+\bar{\mu}_{,j}\tilde{J}_{ik}\nonumber\end{aligned}$$ Hence, given a solution $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ of we can define $f:=-\frac{1}{2}\mu$ which gives a solution of ."
"This definition is the inverse construction to and therefore, the solutions $f$ of and $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ of are in linear $1:1$ correspondence.\
Let us now show the main advantage of working with a system like (\[eq:system\]):

\[lem:frobenius\] Let $(a_{ij},f_i,\mu)$ be a solution of the system (\[eq:system\]) such that $a_{ij}=0$, $f_i=0$, $\mu=0$ at some point $p$ of the connected Kähler manifold $(M,g,J)$."
"Then $a_{ij}\equiv 0$, $f_i\equiv 0$, $\mu\equiv 0$ at all points of $M$."
"The system is in Frobenius form, i.e., the derivatives of the unknowns $a_{ij}, f_i, \mu$ are expressed as (linear) functions of the unknowns: $$\left(\begin{array}{c}a_{ij,k}\\f_{i,j}\\\mu_{,i}\end{array}\right)
  =F\left(\begin{array}{c}a_{ij}\\f_{i}\\\mu\end{array}\right)\nonumber,$$ and all linear systems in the Frobenius form have the property that the vanishing of the solution at one point implies the vanishing at all points."
"If there is a non-constant solution of with $c=1$, then $g$ is positively definite {#sec:proj}
==================================================================================

The goal of this section is to prove the following

\[pos\] Let $(M, g, J)$ be a closed, connected Kähler manifold."
Suppose $f$ is a non-constant solution of with $c=1$.
"Then, the metric $g$ is positively definite."
"First we want to show that it is possible to choose one solution of equation (\[eq:tanno\]) such that the corresponding $(1,1)$-tensor $a^i_j=g^{i\alpha}a_{\alpha j}=-f^{i}_{,j}-2f\delta^{i}_{j}$ has a clear and simple structure of eigenspaces and eigenvectors."
"Evaluating $a_{ij},f_{,ij}$ and $g_{ij}$ on these eigenspaces will show that $g$ has to be positively definite."
"Matrix of the extended system {#99}
-----------------------------

In order to find the special solution of (\[eq:tanno\]) mentioned above, we asign to each solution $f$ of (\[eq:tanno\]) a $(1,1)$-tensor on the $(2n+2)$-dimensional manifold $\widehat{M}={\mathbb R}^2\times M$ with coordinates $(\underbrace{x_+,x_-}_{{\mathbb R}^2},\underbrace{x_1,\dots,x_{2n}}_{M})$."
"For every solution $f$ of equation (\[eq:tanno\]), let us consider the $(2n+2)\times(2n+2)$-matrix $$\begin{gathered}
  \label{eq:operator}
  L(f)=\left(
    \begin{array}{cc|ccc}
      \mu&0&f_{1}&\dots&f_{2n}\\
      0&\mu&\bar{f}_{1}&\dots&\bar{f}_{2n}\\
      \hline
      f^{1}&\bar{f}^{1}&&&\\
      \vdots&\vdots&&a^i_j&\\
      f^{2n}&\bar{f}^{2n}&&&
    \end{array}\right)\end{gathered}$$ where $a_{ij}$ and $\mu$ are defined by the equations ."
"The matrix $L(f)$ is a well-defined $(1,1)$-tensor field on $\widehat{M}$ (in the sense that after a change of coordinates on $M$ the components of the matrix $L$ transform according to tensor rules)."
"Using we see that the identity transformation of $T\widehat{M}$ corresponds to the function $f=-\frac{1}{2}$, i.e."
"$$\begin{gathered}
\nonumber    
L\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)=\left(
      \begin{array}{cc|ccc}
        1&0&0&\dots&0\\
        0&1&0&\dots&0\\
        \hline
        0&0&&&\\
        \vdots&\vdots&&\delta^i_j&\\
        0&0&&&
      \end{array}\right)={\bf 1}
  \end{gathered}$$

The matrix $L$ contains the information on the function $f$ and its first and second derivatives."
"By equation and Lemma \[lem:frobenius\], if this matrix is vanishing at some point of $\widehat{M}$ then $f\equiv 0$ on the whole of $M$."
"In the next section, we will see that the matrix formalism does have advantages: we will show that the polynomials of the matrix $L$ also correspond to certain solutions of equation ."
The constructions which where done here are visually similar to those which can be done for equation .
"However, in the non-Kählerian situation the corresponding $(1,1)$-tensor on the cone manifold is covariantly constant with respect to the connection induced by the cone metric, see [@Gallot1979; @Mounoud2010; @Matveev2010]."
This is not the case for the extended operator which poses additional difficulties.
"Algebraic properties of $L$
---------------------------

Obviously, the mapping $f\longmapsto L(f)$ applied to arbitrary smooth functions $f$ on $M$ is a linear injective mapping between the space of smooth functions on $M$ and the space of $(1,1)$-tensors on $\widehat{M}$."
"For two smooth functions $F$ and $H$ on $M$ let us define a new product $$\begin{aligned}
F*H:=-2FH-\frac{1}{2}F_{,\alpha}H^{\alpha}_{,}\mbox{ and the $k$-fold potency }F^{*k}:=\underbrace{F*...*F}_{k\mbox{ \tiny times}},\nonumber\end{aligned}$$ The product $*$ is bilinear and commuting but not associative."
"However, it turns out that the mapping $L$ now preserves the potencies $f^{*k}$ of solutions of :

\[lem:product\]

1."
Let $f$ be a solution of equation with $c=1$.
"Then, for every $k\geq 0$ there exists a solution $\tilde{f}$ such that $$L^k(f)=L(\tilde {f}), \mbox{ where }L^k = \underbrace{L
        \cdot ... \cdot L}_\text{$k$ times}.$$

2."
"If $f$ is a solution of with $c=1$, then $L^{k}(f)=L(f^{*k})$."
"In particular, $f^{*k}$ is a solution of ."
"$(1)$ Given two solutions $f$ and $F$ of equation , we denote by $(a_{ij},f_i,\mu)$ and $(A_{ij},F_i,{{\mathcal M}})$ the corresponding solutions of , constructed by ."
"After direct calculation we obtain for the product of the corresponding matrices $L(f)$ and $L(F)$: $$\begin{gathered}
 \label{eq:product}
 L(f)\cdot L(F)=\left(
 \begin{array}{cc|ccc}
 \mu {{\mathcal M}}+f_k F^k&f_k \bar{F}^k&\mu
 F_{1}+f_k A^k_1&\dots&\mu F_{2n}+f_k

 \end{array}\right)
 \end{gathered}$$ Suppose that $$\begin{gathered}
 \label{eq:op_eq}
 \mu F_j+f_k A^k_j= {{\mathcal M}}f_j+a^k_j F_k\quad\mbox{and}\quad f^k \bar{F}_k=0

"Now we show that $\tilde {a}_{ij}$, $\tilde {f}_i$ and $\tilde \mu$ satisfy (\[eq:system\])."
"In addition, we show that $L(f)\cdot L(F)$ is self-adjoint."
"Let us check the first equation of : $$\begin{gathered}

 \end{gathered}$$ As we already stated in Remark \[rem:hpro2\], since $(\tilde{a}_{ij},\tilde{f}_{i})$ satisfies , the $1$-form $\tilde{f}_{i}$ is the differential of a function."
"It follows that $\tilde{f}_{i,j}$ is symmetric and from the last calculation we obtain that $\tilde a_{ij}$ is symmetric since it is the linear combination of two symmetric tensors."
"Let us now check the third equation of : $$\begin{gathered}
\nonumber 
\tilde \mu_{, i}=(\mu {{\mathcal M}}+f_k F^k)_{, i}=
 \mu_{, i} {{\mathcal M}}+ \mu {{\mathcal M}}_{, i} +f_{k, i} F^k+f^k

 a^k_i)\stackrel{\eqref{eq:op_eq}}{=}-2\tilde f_i
 \end{gathered}$$ Thus, $(\tilde{a}_{ij},\tilde{f}_{i},\tilde \mu)$ is a solution of .\
Now we show that the operator $L(F)=L^k(f)$ satisfies the conditions ."
"Since $L^{k}\cdot L=L\cdot L^{k}$, using (\[eq:product\]) we obtain $$\mu F_j+f_k A^k_j= {{\mathcal M}}f_j+a^k_j F_k$$ The last condition will be checked by induction."
"Suppose $f^i \bar {F}_i=0$ then $$f^i J^{{i'}}_{\ \ i}\widetilde{F}_{{i'}}=f^i \cdot J^{{i'}}_{\
 \ i}(\mu F_{{i'}}+f_k A^k_{{i'}})=\mu\cdot 0 + f^k
 (J_{\ \ i}^{{i'}}A_{k {{i'}}})f^i=0.$$ From the constructions in , it is obvious that $L(\tilde{f})=L^{k+1}(f)$ where $\tilde{f}=-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\mu}$."
"This completes the proof of the first part of Lemma \[lem:product\].\
Part $(2)$ follows immediately from the already proven part: Proceeding by induction, we assume $L(f^{*k})=L^{k}(f)$."
"We already know from the first part of Lemma \[lem:product\], that $L^{k+1}(f)=L(f)\cdot L^{k}(f)=L(\tilde{f})$."
"The solution $\tilde{f}$ of is given by the formula $\tilde{f}=-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\mu}=-2fF -\frac{1}{2}f_k F^k$, see the equations following formula ."
By assumption $F=f^{*k}$ and therefore $\tilde{f}=f*f^{*k}=f^{*(k+1)}$.
Let us consider the natural operation of polynomials with real coefficients on elements of $T^{1}_{1}\widehat{M}$.
"From Lemma \[lem:product\], we immediately obtain that the family of $(1,1)$-tensors $L(f)$, constructed from solutions $f$ of is invariant with respect to this operation:

Let $f$ be a solution of with $c=1$ and $P(t)=c_k t^k+\dots+c_1 t+c_0$ an arbitrary polynomial with real coefficients."
Then $P*(f):=c_k f^{*k}+c_{k-1} f^{*(k-1)}+\dots+c_1 f-\frac{1}{2}c_0$ is a solution of with $c=1$ and $L(P*(f))=P(L(f))$.
There exists a solution $f$ of such that $L(f)$ is a projector.
"---------------------------------------------------------------

We assume that $(M, g, J)$ is a closed, connected Kähler manifold."
Our goal is to show that the existence of a non-constant solution $f$ of (\[eq:tanno\]) with $c=1$ implies the existence of a solution $\check{f}$ of (\[eq:tanno\]) such that the matrix $L(\check{f})$ is a non-trivial (i.e.
$\neq 0$ and $\neq {{\bf 1}}$) projector.
"(Recall that a matrix $L$ is a *projector*, if $L^2=L$.)."
"We need

\[lem:minim\] Let $(M, g, J)$ be a connected Kähler manifold and $f$ a solution of with $c=1$."
Let $P(t)$ be the minimal polynomial of $L(f)$ at the point $\hat p \in\widehat M$.
"Then, $P(t)$ is the minimal polynomial of $L(f)$ at every point $\hat q\in \widehat M$."
We will always assume that the leading coefficient of a minimal polynomial is $1$.
"As we have already proved, there exists a solution $\tilde{f}$ such that $$P(L(f))=L(\tilde{f}).$$ Since $P(L(f))$ vanishes at the point $\hat p=(x_+, x_-,p)$, we obtain that $\tilde {a}_{ij}=0$, $\tilde{f}_{i}=0$ and $\tilde \mu=0$ at $p$, where $(\tilde {a}_{ij},\tilde{f}_{i},\tilde \mu)$ denotes the solution of corresponding to $\tilde{f}$."
"Then, by Lemma \[lem:frobenius\], the solution $(\tilde a_{ij},\tilde{f}_{i},\tilde
  \mu)$ of is identically zero on $M$."
"Thus, $P(L(f))$ vanishes at all points of $\widehat M$."
"It follows, that the polynomial $P(t)$ is divisible by the minimal polynomial of $L(f)$ at $\hat
  q$."
"By the same reasoning (interchanging $p$ and $q$), we obtain that $Q(t)$ is divisible by $P(t)$."
"Consequently, $P(t)=  Q(t)$."
The eigenvalues of $L(f)$ are constant functions on $\widehat M$.
"By Lemma \[lem:minim\], the minimal polynomial does not depend on the points of $\widehat M$."
"Then, the roots of the minimal polynomial are also constant (i.e., do not depend on the points of $\widehat M$)."
"In order to find the desired special solution of equation (\[eq:tanno\]), we will use that $M$ is closed."
"\[lem:two\_eigenvalues\] Suppose $(M,g,J)$ is a closed, connected Kähler manifold."
Let $f$ be a non-constant solution of with $c=1$.
Then at every point of $\widehat M$ the matrix $L(f)$ has at least two different real eigenvalues.
"Let $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ denote the solution of corresponding to $f$."
"Since $M$ is closed, the function $\mu$ admits its maximal and minimal values $\mu_{\max}$ and $\mu_{\min}$."
Let $p \in M$ be a point where $\mu=\mu_{\max}$.
"At this point, $\mu_{,i}=0$ implying $f_i=\bar {f}_i=0$."
"Then, the matrix of $L(f)$ at $p$ has the form

$$\begin{gathered}
    L(f)=\left(
      \begin{array}{cc|ccc}
        \mu_{\max}&0&0&\dots&0\\
        0&\mu_{\max}&0&\dots&0\\
        \hline
        0&0&&&\\
        \vdots&\vdots&&a^i_j&\\
        0&0&&&
      \end{array}\right)
  \end{gathered}$$

Thus, $\mu_{\max}$ is an eigenvalue of $L(f)$ at $p$ and, since the eigenvalues are constant, $\mu_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$ is an eigenvalue of $L(f)$ everywhere on $M$."
The same holds for $\mu_{\min}$.
"Since $f_i\not\equiv 0$, $\mu$ is not constant implying $\mu_{\max}\ne \mu_{\min}$."
"Finally, $L(f)$ has two different real eigenvalues $\mu_{\max},
  \mu_{\min}$ at every point."
"\[-3\] For further use let us note that in the proof of Lemma \[lem:two\_eigenvalues\] we have proved that if $\mu_{,i}=0$ at a point $p$ then $\mu(p)$ is an eigenvalue of $L$."
"Finally, let us show that there is always a solution of (\[eq:tanno\]) of the desired special kind:

Suppose $(M,g,J)$ is a closed and connected Kähler manifold."
"For every non-constant solution $f$ of with $c=1$, there exists a polynomial $P(t)$ such that $P(L(f))$ is a non-trivial (i.e."
it is neither ${\bf 0}$ nor ${{\bf 1}}$) projector.
We take a point $\hat{p}\in \widehat{M}$.
"By Lemma \[lem:two\_eigenvalues\], $L(f)$ has at least two real eigenvalues at the point $\hat{p}$."
"Then, by linear algebra, there exists a polynomial $P$ such that $P( L(f))$ is a nontrivial projector at the point $\hat{p}$."
"Evidently, a matrix is a nontrivial projector, if and only if its minimal polynomial is $t(t-1)$ (multiplied by any nonzero constant)."
"Since by Lemma \[lem:minim\] the minimal polynomial of $P( L(f))$ is the same at all points, the matrix $P( L(f))$ is a projector at every point of $\widehat{M}$."
"Thus, given a non-constant solution of with $c=1$ on a closed and connected Kähler manifold $M$, without loss of generality we can think that a solution $f$ of (\[eq:tanno\]) with $c=1$ is chosen such that the corresponding $(1,1)$-tensor $L(f)$ is a non-trivial projector."
"Structure of eigenspaces of $a_j^i$, if $L(f)$ is a nontrivial projector
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming that $L(f)$ is a nontrivial projector, it has precisely two eigenvalues $1$ and $0$ and the $(2n+2)$-dimensional tangent space of $\widehat M$ at every point $\hat x=(x_+,x_-,p)$ can be decomposed into the sum of the corresponding eigenspaces $$T_{\hat x}\widehat M =
E_{L(f)}(1)\oplus E_{L(f)}(0).$$ The dimensions of $E_{L(f)}(1)$ and $E_{L(f)}(0)$ are even; we assume that the dimension of $E_{L(f)}(1)$ is $2k+2$ and the dimension of $E_{L(f)}(0)$ is $2n-2k$."
"If $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ is the solution of corresponding to $f$, $\mu_{\max}$ and $\mu_{\min}$ are eigenvalues of $L(f)$, see Lemma \[lem:two\_eigenvalues\]."
Since $L(f)$ is a projector we obtain $\mu_{\min}=0\leq\mu(x)\leq 1=\mu_{\max}$ on $M$.
"In view of Remark \[-3\], the only critical values of $\mu$ are $1$ and $0$."
Let $f$ be a solution of (\[eq:tanno\]) with $c=1$ such that $L(f)$ is a non-trivial projector.
"Let $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ be the solution of corresponding to $f$."
"Then, the following statements hold: \[lem:eigen\]

1."
"At the point $p$ such that $0<\mu< 1$, $a^i_j$ has the following structure of eigenvalues and eigenspaces

    1.  eigenvalue $1$ with geometric multiplicity $2k$;

    2.  eigenvalue $0$ with geometric multiplicity $(2n-2k-2)$;

    3.  eigenvalue $(1-\mu)$ with multiplicity $2$."
2.
"At the point $p$ such that $\mu=1$, $a^i_j$ has the following structure of eigenvalues and eigenspaces:

    1.  eigenvalue $1$ with geometric multiplicity $2k$;

    2.  eigenvalue $0$ with geometric multiplicity $(2n-2k)$;

3."
"At the point $p$ such that $\mu=0$, $a^i_j$ has the following structure of eigenvalues and eigenspaces:

    1.  eigenvalue $1$ with geometric multiplicity $2k+2$;

    2.  eigenvalue $0$ with geometric multiplicity $(2n-2k-2)$."
"We identify $M$ with the set $(0,0)\times M\subset \widehat M$."
"This identification allows us to consider $T_xM$ as a linear subspace of $T_{(0,0)\times x} \widehat M$: the vector $(v_1,...,v_n)\in T_xM$ is identified with $(0,0,v_1,...,v_n)\in T_{(0,0)\times x} \widehat M$."
Consider the point $p$ such that $0<\mu< 1$.
"For any vector $v\in E_{L(f)}(1)\cap T_{p}M$ we calculate $$\begin{gathered}
    L(f) v=\left(
      \begin{array}{cc|ccc}
        \mu&0&f_{1}&\dots&f_{2n}\\
        0&\mu&\bar{f}_{1}&\dots&\bar{f}_{2n}\\
        \hline
        f^{1}&\bar{f}^{1}&&&\\
        \vdots&\vdots&&a^i_j&\\
        f^{2n}&\bar{f}^{2n}&&&
      \end{array}\right)
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        0\\
        0\\
        v^1\\
        \vdots\\
        v^{2n}
      \end{array}
    \right)=
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        f_j v^j\\
        \bar {f}_j v^j\\
        \\
        a^i_j v^j\\
        \\
      \end{array}
    \right)
    = \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        0\\
        0\\
        v^1\\
        \vdots\\
        v^{2n}
      \end{array}
    \right)
  \end{gathered}$$

Thus, $v=(v^1,\dots v^{2n})$ is an eigenvector of $a^i_j$ with eigenvalue $1$, hence $E_{L(f)}(1)\cap T_{p}M$ is contained in the eigenspace $E_{1}$ of $a^{i}_{j}$ with eigenvalue $1$."
"Similarly, any $v \in E_{L(f)}(0)\cap T_{p}M$ is an eigenvector of $a^i_j$ with eigenvalue $0$ and $E_{L(f)}(0)\cap T_{p}M$ is contained in the eigenspace $E_{0}$ of $a^{i}_{j}$ with eigenvalue $0$."
"Note that the dimension of $E_{L(f)}(1)\cap T_{p}M$ is at least $2k$, and the dimension of $E_{L(f)}(0)\cap T_{p}M$ is at least $2n - 2k - 2$."
Let us now show that $f^i$ and $\bar{f}^i$ are eigenvectors of $a^i_j$ with eigenvalue $(1-\mu)$.
"We multiply the first basis vector $(1,0,\dots,0)$ by the matrix $L(f)^2-L(f)$ (which is identically zero) and obtain $$\begin{gathered}
    0 = (L(f)^2-L(f)) \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        1\\
        0\\
        0\\
        \vdots\\
        0
      \end{array}
    \right)=
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        \mu^2 + f_j f^j - \mu\\
        \bar{f}_i f^i\\
        \\
        \mu f^i + a^i_j f^j-f^i\\
        \\
      \end{array}
    \right)
  \end{gathered}$$ This gives us the necessary equation $a^i_j f^j= (1-\mu)f^i$."
"Considering the same procedure for the second basis vector $(0,1,\dots,0)$ we obtain that $\bar{f}^{i}$ is an eigenvector of $a^{i}_{j}$ to the eigenvalue $(1-\mu)$ and hence, the dimension of the eigenspace $E_{1-\mu}$ of $a^{i}_{j}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $1-\mu$ is at least $2$."
"On the one hand, $dim E_{1}+dim E_{0}+dim E_{1-\mu}$ is at most $2n$ but on the other hand, $2k \leq dim(E_{L(f)}(1)\cap T_{p}M)\leq dim E_{1}$, $2n - 2k - 2\leq dim(E_{L(f)}(0)\cap T_{p}M)\leq dim E_{0}$ and $2 \leq dim E_{1-\mu}$ implying that $$\begin{aligned}
T_{p}M=E_{1}\oplus E_{0}\oplus E_{1-\mu}."
"\end{aligned}$$ Furthermore $E_{1}=E_{L(f)}(1)\cap T_{p}M$, $E_{0}=E_{L(f)}(0)\cap T_{p}M$ and $E_{1-\mu}={\mathrm{span}}\{f^{i},\bar{f}^{i}\}$ are of dimensions $2k$, $2n-2k-2$ and $2$ respectively."
The proof at the points such that $\mu=0$ or $\mu=1$ is similar.
"If there exists a solution $f$ of equation (\[eq:tanno\]) such that $L(f)$ is a non-trivial projector, the metric $g$ is positively definite on a closed $M$
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above we have proven that, given a non-constant solution of with $c=1$, there always exists a solution $f$ of (\[eq:tanno\]) such that the corresponding matrix $L(f)$ is a non-trivial projector."
"If $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ is the solution of corresponding to $f$, this implies that the eigenvalues and the dimension of the eigenspaces of $a^i_j$ are given by Lemma \[lem:eigen\]."
Now we are ready to prove that $g$ is positively definite (as we claimed in Theorem \[pos\]).
"Let us consider such a solution $f$ and the corresponding solution $(a_{ij},f_{i},\mu)$ of ."
"We rewrite the second equation in (\[eq:system\]) in the form $$\begin{gathered}
  \label{eq:mu}
  \mu_{,i j} =2 a_{i j} -2 \mu\, g_{i j}\end{gathered}$$ Let $p$ be a point where $\mu$ takes its maximum value $1$."
As we have already shown $f^i(p)=0$ and the tangent space $T_pM$ is equal to the direct sum of the eigenspaces: $$T_p M=E_1\oplus E_0$$ Consider the restriction of (\[eq:mu\]) to $E_0$.
"Since the restriction of the bilinear form $a_{i j}$ to $E_0$ is identically zero, the equation takes the form: $$\left.\mu_{,i j}\right|_{E_0}=-2 \left.g_{i j}\right|_{E_0}.$$ But $\mu_{,i j}$ is the Hessian of $\mu$ at the maximum point $p$."
"Then, it is non-positively definite."
"Hence, the non-degenerate metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is positively definite on $E_0$ at $p$."
"Let us now consider the distribution of the orthogonal complement $E_1^\bot$, which is well-defined, smooth and integrable in a neighborhood of $p$."
The restriction of the metric $g$ onto $E_1^\bot$ is non-degenerate and is positively definite in one point.
"Hence, by continuity it is positively definite in a whole neighborhood."
"Similarly, at a minimum point $q$ one can consider the restriction of (\[eq:mu\]) to $E_1$: $$\left.\mu_{,i j}\right|_{E_1}=2 \left.a_{i j}\right|_{E_1}=2
\left.g_{i j}\right|_{E_1},$$ since $a^{i}_{j\,|E_{1}}=\delta^{i}_{j\,|E_{1}}$, which implies that $g$ is positively definite on $E_1$ at $q$."
"Considering the distribution $E_0^\bot$, we obtain that the restriction of $g$ to $E_0^\bot$ is positively definite in a neighborhood of $q$."
"Let us now consider the general point $x$, where $$T_xM=E_1\oplus E_0 \oplus {\mathrm{span}}\{f^i,\bar{f}^i\}.$$ We choose a piecewise smooth path $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow M$, connecting a point $p=\gamma(0)$ where $\mu(p)=1$ with the point $x=\gamma(1)$, such that there is no point along $\gamma$ where $\mu=0$."
"Since the distribution $E_{1}^{\perp}$ is differentiable on $M\setminus\{q\in M:\mu(q)=0\}$, there cannot be a change of signature of the restriction of the metric $g_{|E_{1}^{\perp}}$ along that path, unless the determinant of $g_{|E_{1}^{\perp}}$ vanishes at some point between $p$ and $x$."
"Since $g$ is nondegenerate, this never can happen and we obtain that $g_{|E_{1}^{\perp}}$ is positively definite at $x$."
Exactly the same arguments can be used if one wants to show that $g_{|E_{0}^{\perp}}$ is positively definite at $x$.
"In the end, we obtain that $g$ is positively definite at each point of $M$ and hence, Theorem \[pos\] is proven."
"Proof of Theorem \[thm:main\] {#sec:proof}
=============================

Let $(M,g,J)$ be a closed, connected pseudo-Riemannian Kähler manifold and $f$ a non-constant solution of equation ."
"By Theorem \[thm:c=0\], $c\neq 0$ and the metric $g$ can be replaced by $\tilde{g}=c\cdot g$ without changing the Levi-Civita connection."
The function $f$ is now a non-constant solution of with $c=1$ and using Theorem \[pos\] we obtain that $\tilde{g}$ has to be positive-definite.
"Applying the classical result of Tanno [@Tanno1978] for positive-definite metrics, we obtain that $(M,4cg,J)$ has constant holomorphic sectional curvature equal to $1$, hence Theorem \[thm:main\] is proven."

Endothelial modulation of resting and stimulated vascular tone in the pig capsular testicular artery.
"We have investigated the wall tension characteristics and the role of endothelium on vascular tone, at rest and under K+ depolarization, in isolated rings from the pig capsular testicular artery."
"The active tension reached a maximum that was significantly lower in vessels without endothelium, whereas the passive tension and the Ca2+-dependent myogenic tone were not significantly affected by endothelium removal."
"Both NG-nitro-l-arginine (L-NOARG, 10(-4) M) and methylene blue (10(-5) M), increased the basal resting tension (BRT) in vessels with endothelium, while indomethacin (10(-6) M) decreased BRT in vessels both with and without endothelium."
"Either removal of endothelium or treatment with indomethacin (10(-6) M), quinacrine (10(-5) M) or ibuprofen (10(-5) M), significantly depressed the K+ concentration response curve, while dazoxiben (10(-5) M) and SQ 30,741 (10(-5) M) had no effect."
"L-NOARG (10(-6) M) potentiated the contractile response to K+ in vessels with endothelium, whereas L-NOARG (10(-4) M) was ineffective in vessels devoid of endothelium."
"These results suggest that a predominating NO release from endothelium, together with a cyclooxygenase-derived vasoconstrictor, modulate vascular tone at rest."
"In contrast, predominant endothelial release of a cyclooxygenase-derived contractile factor, but different from TXA2, PGH2 or superoxide anions, is induced by K+ depolarization and leads to vasoconstriction."
"After a string of frustrating injuries, Indiana head coach Tom Allen had a plan for his starting quarterback going into the offseason."
"And much like he did on the field when healthy in 2019, Michael Penix was executing on that plan at a very high level."
"At its core, the idea was that Penix needed to get bigger and stronger to help him endure the physicality of Big Ten football."
"“We set out a plan for him and his weight has increased quite a bit since the end of the season,” Allen said in February as the team was getting set to embark on spring practice."
"After checking in on the 2019 roster at 202 pounds, Penix added more than 15 pounds while rehabbing from a shoulder injury that ended his 2019 season."
"“He’s close to 220 — 217, 218 right now,” Allen said in February."
"“Really changing himself there which is really important.”

Penix officially weighed in at 218 on the 2020 spring roster, and he looked noticeably more muscular as IU took the field in March."
That was then.
Now?
"The annual Cream and Crimson spring game should be in 10 days, but instead Penix, like just about everyone else around the country, is back home."
"Tampa, Fla., to be precise."
"Penix is long way from the IU weight room in the the north end zone of Memorial Stadium, and a long way from the training table meals that college athletes are accustomed to."
"But while much has changed over the last month, Penix found a familiar face to help keep him on the plan."
"“My mom’s been cooking a lot for me,” Penix said this week on a teleconference."
And so far mom’s home cooking has been on point.
"“My weight’s definitely been staying the same, if not going up a little bit."
"I’m certainly not losing any weight,” Penix said."
"While everything he knew a month ago has changed, Penix believes that maintaining his new physique is part of his commitment to his team."
And that is fueling him to find answers rather than excuses.
“I can’t just go out and come back not my weight.
"That would be letting my team down and that’s something I’m not going to do,” Penix said."
"While mom is keeping Penix well fed in the kitchen, the challenges in the weight room and on the football field are far greater."
The biggest challenge of them all?
What weight room?
What football field?
Penix’s experience over the last month has been like most everyone else throughout this evolving COVID-19 pandemic.
Just when you think you find an answer to get you through your new reality — things change.
"“At the beginning of this, we were on the field."
"We were going basic quarterback drills, just continue to stay fresh on mechanics,” Penix said."
"As a quarterback, Penix needs plenty of open space to refine his craft."
"And day by day, that space is shrinking."
"“As they’re closing the fields down here, it’s just been a lot of fractional work."
"Making sure that we’re studying film and helping me just continue to focus and stay sharp on my game,” Penix said."
Probably no one has had a greater challenge in the IU program in recent weeks than new strength coach Aaron Wellman.
"All Wellman has had to do in his first days on the job is design customized training plans for every player on the team, that he has never met, based on the equipment that they have, or don’t have, available at home."
Allen remarked that Penix had been one of the top five performers in the workouts back at the cozy confines of Memorial Stadium over the winter.
Weight training is the key component to Penix’s additional pounds.
"But now the redshirt sophomore has been reduced to what he has available, and Wellman’s plan."
"“He (Wellman) gave us all workouts,” Penix said."
“He made them specific for whatever we had.
He sent out body workouts if we don’t have weights.
He sent out dumbbell workouts.
"If you have a full gym, he sent us a full gym workout."
He’s been talking to us and continuing to tell us that working out is going to keep us in shape.
"I’ve been training and running on my own for the most part.”

There is one more thing that Penix is missing throughout this strange new reality."
Something every good quarterback needs.
Receivers.
"Penix has been staying in touch with that group remotely, and he hopes to reunite with the guys that are uniquely capable of providing him with the repetitions he needs soon."
“I’m going to go back to Bloomington soon just to get with some receivers.
We are always communicating.
"We always talk about how we want to run things,” Penix said."
But as for when that will be?
Penix is stuck under the same cloud of uncertainty as the rest of us.
“No specific plans yet.
"It is whenever the time comes,” Penix said."

Picking a favorite superhero is tough.
"But as of today thanks to good, not-so-old-fashioned Google Trends analytics, we know one thing for certain: Batman is the most popular superhero in the world – on YouTube at least."
"Logging more than 3 billion views of more than 71,000 hours of video, the Dark Knight is almost a billion views ahead of the next most popular hero—Thor—based on data released today by YouTube."
"Coming up close behind Thor is Superman, with 1.7 billion views and counting, and close behind the Man of Steel is Iron Man, the Avengers, and Wolverine."
"(Google’s analysis only looked at the specific name of each character, so nicknames like Man of Steel and Dark Knight weren’t counted in the totals.)"
"“If YouTube popularity can determine who’ll win the upcoming Batman vs. Superman movie, your views and uploads put Batman as the clear winner,” the video-sharing site wrote on the YouTube Trends blog today."
"“Based on keyword searches, Batman is the most popular of all superheroes on YouTube.”

All told, the top 10 superheroes on YouTube have amassed more than 10 billion views and some 234,000 hours of video, and even though Batman may “the one man who beat” Superman in overall searches since YouTube launched in 2005, his status has fallen a bit since 2008—overcome by searches for Thor, Iron Man, and the rest of the Avengers."
Some of this data seems fairly obvious–most of the search spikes each hero’s timeline correlate to the release of films about that character or group of characters (in the case of the Avengers)—but there are a few interesting and unexpected tidbits.
"For example, Superman, despite being consistently popular (lots of Smallville fans out there?)"
"and coming in third place, never really sees a huge bump in interest."
"There was a small jump in June when Man of Steel was released, but nothing like the leap Iron Man saw a month earlier around the release of Iron Man 3."
"It’s also surprising that Spider-Man, who has had a string of successful films in the last few years—all with his name in the title—actually comes in at No."
"7, with 340 million views, and Captain America, who had his own film and is an Avenger, is behind him."
"It’s also interesting that after those two not-so-super heroes and the Justice League, which is getting a film in 2017, sits Deadpool—the off-kilter anti-hero with no movie (yet) but a loyal following."
The analytics don’t reveal why the searches were done (obviously) but it’s possible folks were looking for tidbits from the Marvel character’s videogame or simply trying figure out who this “Deadpool” is that everyone’s talking about.
"Either way, he’s got a lot of catching up to do before he ever reaches Batman status."

"A case of GM1-gangliosidosis type I: glycosphingolipid profiles of urine and transformed lymphocytes and beta-D-galactosidase activities in peripheral lymphocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts and transformed lymphocytes."
A female infant with early-onset GM1-gangliosidosis type I was investigated.
"The lymphocytes, transformed lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts of the patient were demonstrated to have severe beta-D-galactosidase deficiency."
The beta-D-galactosidase activities of these cells from the patient's father and mother were at the lower limit of the normal range.
"The oligosaccharide accumulation in urine of the patient showed the typical type I GM1-gangliosidosis pattern, but no GM1 ganglioside was detected in the patient's urine or transformed lymphocytes."
The clinical features were compatible with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis.
The mixture of homogenates from the cultured fibroblasts or transformed lymphocytes of the patient and controls showed no complementation of beta-D-galactosidase activity against the controls.
I don’t want to masquerade as an all-wise mother and grandma.
No mother of 4 daughters ever masters sibling rivalry.
"In the last 3 years, since 3 daughers became mothers, I feel like I am back in adolescence and all the rules have changed."
My daughters find my journals hysterically funny.
"Fall 176–Emma is 3 1/2; Michelle is 17 months

When Emma came home from nursery school, she wanted me to read Green Eggs and Ham."
"She settled on my lap in the small black chair, and I began to read."
"Michelle immediately came over protesting, tried to climb into the chair."
"I assumed she wanted to listen to the story, so I asked Emma to move to the couch, so we all could fit."
"But then Michelle started grabbing the book, bringing me her books to read."
"I discouraged her, feeling she had had my exclusive attention for 4 hours; now it was Emma’s turn."
"My friend Terry offered to read to Michelle, but she struggled down from her lap 2 or 3 times."
I finished reading Green Eggs and Ham.
"Terry started to read to Emma and Erin, so I could read to Michelle."
Michelle got down from my lap and tried to grab the book away from Terry.
"When that failed, she tried bribery–3 books, her blanket, a slip, her rabbit skin."
"Erin wanted the rabbit skin, but every time she took it away from Michelle, she protested and only stopped when Terry took it back from Erin."
Finally Michelle used one of the cardboard blocks to climb on the ottoman; from there she lunged for the big black chair where Terry was sitting with Emma and Erin.
"She didn’t quite make it and had to be rescued, but she had achieved her purpose–the reading stopped."
"I’ve noticed that she often starts fussing if someone picks up Emma, reads to her, pays her exclusive attention in any way, shape, or form

I’m glad to see such self-assertion on her part, even though I feel pulled in two directions now with both of them clamoring for exclusive attention."
It frees me from being Michelle’s defender.
More and more I can let them learn to handle their disputes by themselves.
"I know Emma’s worst won’t really hurt Michelle, and Michelle’s protests more than enough to warn me if any mayhem is actually occurring."
"Once or twice lately I’ve rushed in ready to scold Emma, when Michelle’s protests had absolutely nothing to do with her."
Emma’s being away at school mornings seems to have encouraged Michelle to increase her demands.
"If she could get rid of Anne in the mornings, why not all day?"
"After describing this revealing incident, I earnestly tried to establish rules for myself ."
"As the oldest of six, I probably overidentified with Emma."
"I read this to her recently, when her son was Michelle’s age, and we collapsed in helpless laughter."
"How earnest and intellectual I was trying to be, pretending I could objectively stay above the fray."
Some of my advice is excellent; too bad I wasn’t able to follow it.
I had obviously read too many parenting books and taken too many contradictory parenting classes.
"When in doubt about what to do, don’t interfere."
"If I am concerned that one of them could really get hurt, always intervene."
"In practical terms, that means always being within interfering distance when they are both playing on the slide, on the climbing structure, or on the terrace."
"When other people are around who would tend to think very badly of Emma if she made Michelle cry, intervene."
Protect Emma from Michelle.
"She should have time alone in her room to paint, to build with blocks, when Michelle is not constantly at her back, intent to destroy what she has just made."
"When Emma complains that Michelle is bothering her, respond and help her out."
It is completely unreasonable to expect Emma to handle Michelle’s interference by herself.
I find it hard enough to distract single-minded Michelle.
Encourage Anne to find solutions to the problem herself.
“I’m sorry Michelle keeps knocking down your blocks.
Do you have any idea how we can stop her from doing it.” Poor Anne.
"No wonder, she told me, a few years later, “Don’t give me any of that active listening crap.”

Try to spend one hour special time with Anne after dinner."
"Now that she will be away from me three hours a day in nursery school, this is particularly important."
Make a firm rule about no hitting with things.
The thing used as a weapon gets put in the closet until the next day.
"“Blocks are for building, not for hitting Michelle."
"You can have it back tomorrow.”

When I find it necessary to intervene, use actions not words."
"No screaming, no getting angry."
Separate them physically.
"Then, and only then, try to help Anne."
“I think you are trying to say something to Michelle.
Talk it.
You can talk; you don’t have to hit.
"I know how you feel, but I can’t let you hurt Michelle."
"It makes her feel like hitting you.”

When one of them is likely to continue hurting, use physical restraint."
"Take her to another room to calm down, telling her she can come back when she can play without hurting."
Don’t get angry.
"If I can’t intervene without getting angry, don’t bother."
"Michelle is not a helpless baby, and she is not always an innocent victim."
Don’t always assume I saw the curtain-raiser to this particular squabble.
"In my defense, my daughters are all very close to one another and form a wonderful support system."

"Barberini, the name of a powerful Italian family, originally of Tuscan extraction, who settled in Florence during the early part of the 11th century."
"They acquired great wealth and influence, and in 1623 Maffeo Barberini was raised to the papal throne as Urban VIII."

That's completely correct.
Such a method doesn't exist yet as it's not supported by libgit2 yet.

Description

Located in the easternmost shore in the Gulf of La Spezia, opposite Porto Venere, Tino and Plamaria islands and near the eastuary of river Magra, Lerici is one among the most beautiful towns of Liguria."
It has preserved its original medieval structure.
"Thanks to its bay, well-sheltered against libeccio and sirocco, and its proximity to Francigena road, it became a very important maritime and commercial junction over the centuries."
Lerici has always been a reference harbour for pilgrims travelling to Rome or even St. James of Compostela.
"The harbour has always hosted cargo, passenger and military ships."
"What is striking in the landscape around Lerici and its harbour is certainly the castle which overlooks the harbour and the bay, once a point of contention between Genoa and Pisa."
"The harbour itself extends from the castle through a 250-metre-long dock, two piers and a quay."
"Today, its hosts many fishing and recreational boats, most of which are stationary."
"Moreover, there are some areas reserved for transiting boats, equipped with water and electricty and managed by Erix Sailing Club."
These areas can receive both motor and sailing boats up to 12 m. Some mooring places are also available (only for sailing boats) at the piers owned by the Club and the buoys.
"The club provides guests with toilets, showers, Wi-Fi and even a terrace."
"The dock is equipped with a coffee bar, a gas station and a scuba diving centre."
"The town of Lerici, of course, offers all you need: having a walk along the dock at the sunset and tasting the typical Ligurian delicacies at one of the many restaurants existing here is with no doubt a unique and unforgettable experience."
"Together with La Spezia and Porto Venere, Lerici faces the famous and wonderful Gulf of Poets."
"Together with the not far San Terenzo, these towns have hosted stars like Lord Byron and Mary Shelley over the years."
"Another interesting village in the surroundings is Tellaro, a typical coastal village, considered one among the most beautiful seaside villages of Italy."

The invention relates to a self-tapping screw.
"This type of self-tapping screw is screwed into a predrilled drill hole in the substrate using a suitable tool such as, for example, a screwdriver, drill hammer, screw-wench or the like, wherein the start of the thread of the screw grooves a mating thread into the substrate that corresponds to the thread."
"The subsequent thread of the screw engages in the mating thread, whereby when a load is applied to the screw, it transmits the load to the substrate."
"In a soft substrate such as, for example, porous concrete or plasterboard, self-tapping screws can also be screwed in directly without predrilling a drill hole in the soft substrate."
An essential advantage of self-tapping screws is the possibility of unscrewing them from the substrate without parts of the fastening that was created remaining in the substrate.
"Self-tapping concrete screws, which are driven into mineral substrates, are also used in practice by users for temporary fastenings, for example, in concrete form work, building scaffolding or when configuring drilling and cutting tools in diamond drilling and separating technology."
"As a result, the self-tapping screws are not only removable, but are also reusable in principle."
Known from European Patent Document No.
"EP 1 862 677 A1 is a self-tapping screw with a shaft, which has a first end and an opposing second end with a load-engaging means, and with a thread, which extends at least in sections over the length of the shaft, wherein at least one wear indicator means is provided on the thread."
The at least one wear indicator means of the known screw indicates the rate of wear of the thread and thereby allows a conclusion to be drawn about the load capacity or load bearing property of a removed self-tapping screw and about its ability to be reused.
"When manufacturing the screw as well as during its use, parts of the thread can break out, which the user might inadvertently interpret as wear indicator means."
This could lead to a misinterpretation with respect to the reusability of the screw.
"The object of the invention is creating a self-tapping screw, in particular a concrete screw, which can be used several times and in which a simple assessment of usability is possible."
"According to the invention, at least one identifier is provided on the screw for identifying the wear indicator."
The at least one identifier guarantees a clear identification of the at least one wear indicator.
"Because of the identifier provided on the screw, it is no longer possible for any undesired breakouts in the thread or damage to the thread to be inadvertently interpreted as a wear indicator."
"As a result, even with repeated use of a self-tapping screw that has wear indicators, a reliable assessment by the user with respect to its reusability is guaranteed."
The at least one identifier is preferably provided on a thread flank of the thread and preferably directly adjacent to the wear indicator to be identified by this identifier.
The at least one identifier is advantageously configured directly during the forming of the thread on the thread.
The at least one identifier is preferably provided on an outer side of the shaft and advantageously directly adjacent to the wear indicator to be identified by this identifier.
The at least one identifier is advantageously configured directly during the forming of the shaft on the shaft.
"Several identifiers may be provided on a self-tapping screw, each of which is arranged on the thread flanks of the thread and/or on the outer side of the shaft."
"The at least one identifier is preferably a depression provided on the screw, which can be configured in a simple manner during manufacturing of the self-tapping screw, e.g., in a rolling method, on the screw."
"The at least one identifier is preferably an elevation provided on the screw, which can be configured in a simple manner during manufacturing of the self-tapping screw, e.g., in a rolling method, on the screw."
"Several identifiers may be provided on a self-tapping screw, which are configured as depressions and/or as elevations."
"In addition, the at least one identifier may also be a profiling, which features only depressions, only elevations, or depressions and elevations."
"At least two identifiers are preferably provided for identifying a wear indicator, which make a simple and precise identification of the wear indicator possible."
"The at least one identifier preferably has a polygonal design in plan view, whereby the at least one identifier features an advantageous design for identifying the corresponding wear indicator."
"A corner of the at least one identifier advantageously points in the direction of the to-be-identified wear indicator, thereby further improving the identifiability of the to-be-identified wear indicator."
The identifier has an especially advantageous triangular design in plan view.
"In an alternative embodiment, the at least one identifier has a round design in plan view, thereby making it possible for the at least one identifier to be configured in a simple way."
"In addition to a circular design, the at least one identifier may also have an oval design or a design with more than two inflection points."
The invention is explained in greater detail in the following on the basis of exemplary embodiments.
Child custody and support laws have become more onerous over the last 50 years due to fewer parents staying together and women becoming equally as capable as men at earning a living outside the home.
"Instead of reflecting these changes, the laws have lagged behind, continuing to favor mothers over fathers."
"The laws generally award primary custody to the parent who spent more time at home with the children and less time working, even if the difference was miniscule."
"The other parent is then ordered to pay a crushing amount of child support, sometimes on top of alimony."
"In a small percentage of situations, usually where the father was the primary caregiver, this situation is reversed and the laws punish the mother."
Fathers have reacted over the years in different ways.
Some fathers' rights activists in Britain dress up as super heroes and scale public buildings to draw attention to the inequity.
"The founder of Fathers 4 Justice, Matt O'Connor, started a hunger strike for equal parenting earlier this month outside the home of British Prime Minister David Cameron."
Some fathers tragically commit suicide.
"Last month, a distraught father immolated himself on the steps of a courthouse in New Hampshire, after mailing a 15-page ""last statement"" to the local newspaper detailing his final frustrations with the child custody legal system."
"The most high-profile victim of the child custody system, actor Alec Baldwin, helped bring exposure to the unfairness by writing a book about his experience."
"Although a few small changes have been made to the laws within the last few years, due to exposure and the efforts of advocacy organizations, there has not been significant progress."
"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 84 percent of custodial parents are mothers, a figure that has not changed since 1983."
"This is unfortunate, because Canadian economist Paul Miller analyzed data on families and found that ""parental gender is not a…predictor at all of any of the child outcomes examined, that is behavioral, educational or health outcomes."""
"The children often end up with ""Parental Alienation Syndrome,"" developing a dislike for the noncustodial parent bought on by the custodial parent."
Long term studies of children in the U.S. and New Zealand have found there is a direct correlation between a father's absence and teen pregnancy.
"The latest effort to change the system calls for ""shared parenting."""
"Although advocacy groups differ on how shared parenting would be implemented, it generally consists of making the default custody arrangement 50/50 joint physical and legal custody when parents split up, absent egregious circumstances."
"This would replace the current system which leaves it up to a judge's whim to decide what constitutes ""the best interests of the child."""
"Shared parenting bills are being introduced in state legislatures around the country, and several states now have some version of shared parenting."
"In those states, studies are finding that divorce rates are lower and the children are better adjusted."
"In addition to passing shared parenting laws, there must be tougher requirements for issuing restraining orders and reform of child support laws."
50/50 shared custody should not include child support unless there are egregious circumstances.
Child support creates an incentive to continue fighting.
"Neither parent wants to get stuck paying it, and some parents greedily want it as a source of income to use as they please, since there is little monitoring of how it is spent."
"Eliminate child support in all but the most egregious situations, and most of the fighting clogging our family courts will cease."
"The ""deadbeat dad"" roundups by law enforcement of fathers who are behind in child support needs to stop."
"Many of them are fathers who were not lucky enough to be awarded custody, and are now working two jobs just to try and keep up with expenses and child support."
"Figures from the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement show that more than two-thirds of ""deadbeat dads"" earn poverty-level wages, and only four percent earn $40,000 or more per year."
Less than one in 20 noncustodial parents who suffer a drop in income are able to get the court to reduce their child support payments.
Grandparents often end up paying the child support.
Laws like the Violence Against Women Act need to be repealed or significantly revised.
"Every year $1 billion is given to domestic violence organizations, making it very easy for one spouse to complain about the other and have the complaint used against them in child custody disputes."
"These organizations, which tend to favor women, have now formed their own lobbying organizations that fight against meaningful changes in child custody laws."
David Usher of The Center for Marriage Policy believes the solution lies in renewing the importance of marriage.
He proposes eliminating no-fault divorce laws and requiring couples where only one spouse wants a divorce to work out the divorce agreement themselves.
"This would disincentivize divorce, since couples could no longer simply run to court to end the marriage, but would be forced to work with each other to come up with a custody situation they both agree to."
"Currently, marriage is about the only kind of contract where one party can unilaterally end the contract."
"The Center for Marriage Policy recommends shared parenting that would place a child primarily with one parent for the first half of their childhood, then with the second parent for their later years."
The small changes that have been made in recent years are encouraging.
"Thanks to organizations like Fathers and Families, last year Massachusetts, which has some of the most punishing child support laws in the country, reduced the interest on overdue child support by 50%."
Legislation has been passed in several states around the country within the past year protecting disabled and military parents from child custody abuses.
"As families continue to modernize, and more women also suffer the effects of outdated child custody laws, the laws will be finally forced to keep up."
It may just not be in our lifetime.
"This is a new kind of civil rights struggle, and one day our great-grandchildren will look back and remember their forefathers who fought so hard for their right to have meaningful time with both parents."

"Drill hole SC-82W intersected another higher grade massive sulphide zone approximately 45 metres updip from a similar intersection reported originally in hole SC-82 (October 29, 2015 press release)."
"As was the case in SC-82, this shallower high grade massive sulphides intercept is located along the potential up-dip extension of the CFO Lens."
Another mineralized interval was also obtained along the Gap Lens in hole SC-31W2.
"These mineralized intervals, as were all intercepts released by the Company since June, are located outside of the mineral resources as currently estimated (see attached Figure 1) at the Scott project."

As this is still preliminary drilling on the above mineralization, the exact shape and true width cannot be determined with certainty."
The core lengths obtained may not reflect the true width of the mineralization.
The high grade massive sulphides (5.0 metres of 12.1% zinc and 0.7% copper) discovered at a depth of 588.6 metres are associated with a distinct mineralized horizon located about 100 metres to the north of the one hosting the newly discovered Gap Lens.
These sulphides are associated with a rhyolite unit known as “Tony Rhyolite” and this interval is therefore interpreted as being located along the up-dip extension of the CFO Lens but at much shallower depth than indicated by previous work (see attached Figure 1).
Hole SC-82W did not intersect mineralization along the Gap Lens.
"Indeed, at the targeted depth volcanic host rocks are cut by barren intrusive rocks associated with the Chibougamau Pluton."
"This situation is analogous to what happened in hole SC-53W5 (see Figure 1 and press release of October 13, 2015) and reinforces the concept of a steep plunge to the west for the Gap Lens and possibly the West Lens."
"Hole SC-31W2 is a wedge cut drilled from hole SC-31W (press release of November 30, 2015)."
"The stringer sulphides in SC-31W2 are all hosted by altered rhyolite, as is the case in the West Lens and in previous intersections from the Gap Lens."
Company president Gérald Riverin stated: “We are very encouraged with the high grade results of SC-82W along the CFO horizon.
"Now with a second cut on this target horizon, we are confident that this shallower high grade zone has some extent and may develop into a significant zone."
"We are looking forward to pursuing drilling in this sector.”

Drilling will resume shortly with one drill rig and in fact the hole that was in progress just before the winter holiday break had already reached a depth of 900 metres and was close to the target depth."
"All drill core discussed in this press release was logged and marked up for assay at the Company’s secure facility in Chibougamau, Quebec."
Drill core for assay was split in half.
Half of the core was shipped in sample bags to Techni-Lab S.G.B.
"Abitibi Inc. (ACTLABS) of Ste-Germaine-Boulé, Quebec, with appropriate standards, duplicates and replicates used for quality control purposes."
The other half of the core is retained for future reference.

Levels of plasma lipid peroxides before and after choledocholithotomy in patients with obstructive jaundice.
Plasma lipid peroxide levels were measured in a group of 40 healthy controls and 11 patients with jaundice.
"In the case of these 11 patients, we checked the plasma lipid peroxide concentrations prior to and after choledocholithotomy."
"Before choledocholithotomy, there were significantly higher mean concentrations of plasma lipid peroxides and bilirubin in patients with jaundice than in the control cases (11.8 +/- 2.3 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 nmol/ml and 10.3 +/- 1.82 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.03 mg/dl, respectively, P < 0.05)."
"In addition, patients with jaundice had lower plasma vitamin E levels in comparison to the controls (8.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 12.2 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml, P < 0.05)."
"In patients with jaundice, the increased plasma lipid peroxides were clearly related to the serum levels of bilirubin (r = 0.87, P < 0.05)."
"After surgery, the higher plasma levels of lipid peroxide and bilirubin were reduced markedly (11.8 +/- 2.3 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.4 nmol/ml and 10.3 +/- 1.82 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.47 mg/dl, respectively, P < 0.05) with the restoration of bile flow which was associated with improvement in liver function tests."
"Consequently, these results suggest that there is an involvement of lipid peroxidation in liver cells damaged by obstructive jaundice in patients with cholelithiasis, and that these high plasma lipid peroxide levels may correlate with the severity of the disease."
Serotonergic mediation of tetrahydro-beta-carboline.
"Rats were trained to discriminate between the stimulus properties of tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC) and its vehicle in a two-lever, food-motivated operant task."
"By steadily increasing the training dose, the discrimination was attained at 20.0 mg/kg THBC."
Dose-response experiments subsequently indicated that decreasing doses of THBC produced decreased discrimination and generated an ED50 = 3.63 mg/kg.
"Administration of the serotonergically-active drug, fenfluramine, produced THBC-appropriate responding in a dose-responsive manner."
"In addition, LSD and yohimbine produced partial generalizations in the THBC-trained rats."
These data suggest that the discriminative stimulus properties of THBC are mediated by serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system.

"People don't want to open Portage and Main to pedestrians because they have no idea what it will look like, urban planners say after a new poll suggested declining support for yanking barriers from the iconic intersection."
"Michelle Richard, a former planner with the City of Winnipeg, says no vision or drawings have been presented to show the benefits of a pedestrian-friendly intersection — so people have drawn their own conclusions ahead of next month's plebiscite."
"""People will inevitably kind of fall to the perspective that they feel sort of speaks to their concerns — and for most Winnipeggers, it's a traffic concern."""
"The proportion of people who favour opening Portage and Main to pedestrians is at its lowest mark in the 20 years Probe Research has tracked this topic, suggests the poll, which was commissioned by CBC Manitoba."
The top concern driving opposition is the fear of traffic gridlock.
"Support for opening the intersection rose slowly, peaking at 42 per cent in 2016, but it has since slipped precipitously, with only 33 per cent of Winnipeggers who responded to the late August poll saying they want to reopen the intersection."
The poll of 600 Winnipeg adults was weighted to reflect the city's age and gender demographics and has a margin of error of plus or minus four per cent.
"Even among young adults and people who live, work or play downtown, the majority of poll respondents don't want people walking across Portage and Main."
The poll suggests 42 per cent of Winnipeggers aged 18-34 and 48 per cent of those who frequently spend time downtown want the intersection reopened.
And they're unlikely to budge from their stance.
Seventy-six per cent of respondents said either there's no chance or it's unlikely they will change their minds.
"""There is a broad and deep intense dislike for this idea,"" said Mary Agnes Welch, a senior researcher at Probe Research."
She believes the abrupt drop is linked to the recent focus on opening Portage and Main.
The concept has become real to Winnipeggers for perhaps the first time since it was closed to pedestrians in 1979 in order to shoehorn people toward the shops downstairs.
"'Lost' in the conversation

Richard, now a planning consultant with Richard Wintrup and Associates, said the declining support conflicts with the walkable neighbourhoods where we crave to live and the areas we seek out as tourists."
"Portage and Main should be a similar haven, she argued."
"""Something's been lost here,"" she said."
"""The focus of opening an intersection is, from my perspective, not the right focus."
"It's about how do we create the heart of Winnipeg in this place,"" she said."
"""Walking, and the opening of the intersection, is just one part of that whole vision that really should have been explored over the last four years."""
"In 2014, Brian Bowman was elected mayor after a campaign during which he promised to reopen the intersection."
"Negotiations with the property owners at the intersection's corners lasted until early 2017, traffic study findings were revealed later that year, and the cost was pegged at $6 million with $5.5 million more to bolster Winnipeg Transit's fleet to accommodate rush-hour delays."
"A request for designs for the revitalized intersection, made earlier this year, has been shelved until after the plebiscite determines whether the majority of the public is even interested."
"While all this was going on, no one explained to Winnipeggers how an opened intersection could influence the city's economic, social and environmental well-being for the better, Richard said."
Time-lapse video shot from the roof of the Fairmont Hotel shows late-afternoon traffic at Winnipeg's most famous intersection.

""Nobody's gone through a process to explore and let people kind of have the opportunity to be brought along with an alternative vision,"" said Richard, who questions why the city never introduced a public awareness campaign."
"""Maybe moving forward, it has to be there."
"I don't know how you recover from the numbers [in this poll]."""
"She said the survey's findings do not go against the city's efforts to promote active transportation, such as more bike lanes."
"Protected routes for cyclists, for example, can be seen and understood by people, Richard said."
"""With Portage and Main, it's something a little less tangible."""
"People have been barred from crossing Portage and Main on foot since 1979, when property owners agreed to shoehorn pedestrians into the underground concourse and toward its businesses."
"(Lyzaville Sale/CBC)

Richard Milgrom, head of the University of Manitoba's department of city planning, understands the resistance to a barrier-free intersection."
"There has to be some kind of concept for voters to consider, he said."
"""People don't know what they're voting to have."""
"Too many haven't considered that the intersection would have to be remodelled, he said."
"There would likely be barrier changes, a redeveloped median and a concerted effort to make Portage and Main a place where people want to linger, he said."
"""What most people want is what they know, and what people know is 'I like to drive my car through Portage and Main.'"""
The survey suggests 28 per cent of people consider traffic flow the top reason to keep the intersection closed to pedestrians.
"Other arguments, in order of preference, are the cost, safety of pedestrians and the view the investment will not improve the downtown."
"This debate hangs on traffic, Welch said."
"""That is sort of the litmus test on this question — do you think cars should be king or do you think pedestrians should be king?"
"And we are profoundly divided on that issue."""
"Cars take precedence

Hazel Borys, a Winnipeg-based urban planner, believes Portage and Main will always be the realm of cars, but it can and should exist for more modes of transportation."
"""We don't think of it as a people place, we think of it as a car place, but it can really be both, and it can be both really gracefully."""
"The survey suggests 66 per cent of people agree with the statement that ""smooth traffic through the downtown is more important than pedestrian access."""
"Sixty per cent of respondents don't enjoy spending time downtown, while 33 per cent believe it's important for visitors and tourists to cross the intersection on foot."
"Many other intersections in downtown Winnipeg have similar traffic counts, yet there are no complaints about permitting vehicle and pedestrians at those corners, Borys said."
"""So much about this is just our perception."
"What does it mean to be a car city and what does it mean to also open ourselves to other ways of getting around?"""
"In line with the city's swelling population, increasingly more vehicles are on Winnipeg roads."
"As of Sept. 1, 381,279 passenger vehicles were registered in Winnipeg, a total that has increased annually for at least the last decade, Manitoba Public Insurance said."
Milgrom believes the city's car culture is firmly entrenched in part because some people have no choice but to drive.
"""It doesn't work to say people shouldn't be driving cars everywhere."
"There has to be some good viable alternatives to it,"" he said."
"""Right now we have an underfunded transit system."
"We have pedestrian environments that generally aren't very good."""
"People cross Main Street at Portage Avenue in February 1979, seven months before the underground pedestrian concourse opened."
"(Winnipeg Archives)

The 2016 census results say 69 per cent of the city's commuters (216,675 citizens) are driving their vehicles to work and nine per cent of people (28,065) are passengers, with the latter a rising figure."
"Transit ridership fell 1.1 per cent from the 2011 census to 42,375 riders in 2016, and walking to work remained fairly steady at nearly 19,000 Winnipeggers, or six per cent of commuters."
"Convincing more drivers to turn over their keys will take time, Milgrom said."
"City planning cannot be overhauled in a night, and urban sprawl nearly stipulates a driver's licence for many."
"On an average weekday, 81,000 vehicles pass through Portage and Main, the City of Winnipeg says."
"(Gary Solilak/CBC)

""We need some people who will stand up and do the right thing."
"If we make every single decision based on some sort of referendum, it's going to be very hard."""
"Outside Winnipeg's downtown, nearly four in five denizens balk at opening the intersection."
"Frank Capasso, president of the Sage Creek Residents Association, said he understands where his neighbours are coming from, even though he's in the minority who support opening the intersection."
"""To get downtown, unless you have a car, it's difficult to get to from where I live,"" Capasso said."
"Suburbs like his are growing, and his neighbours rarely feel compelled to go downtown."
They pass through the centre of the city to go elsewhere.
"Frank Sherlock, executive vice-president of property management at Artis REIT, wants a strategy for reopening the intersection to pedestrians that goes beyond a paint job and new lighting."
"(Marcy Makusa/CBC)

""We don't go enough downtown so people don't want it open."""
Frank Sherlock has a big stake in the future of the intersection.
"He's executive vice-president of property management at Artis REIT, which owns 1.5 million square feet of property around the intersection, including the Shops at Winnipeg Square."
"He supports making the corner pedestrian-friendly, but he wants meaningful development and investment along with it."
Painting lines on pavement and installing street lighting is not enough.
"""If it's just opening the intersection, making it look like any other intersection and doing nothing else, I think it will be a flop."""
"The referendum is non-binding, but Bowman and Jenny Motkaluk, the most high-profile candidates for mayor, have promised to do what the majority wants."

How to write an update hook for git submodules?"
"I would like to copy some files in the submodules in my ""vendor/assets"" directory to another directory -- ""public/assets."""
I heard about update hooks but I am not sure if they work for submodules.
"I wrote a simple hook and ran update from commandline, but it didn't work."
"My update hook looks like this:
#.git/gooks/update.rb

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts ""Copying files...""

So is this even possible?"
"btw, I'm using Braid to manage my submodules."
"A:

The update hook is only run when someone has pushed into the current repository, which doesn't sound like what you want."
"You could use the post-commit hook, if you want to copy these files into place every time you create a commit in your repository."
"(That should be sufficient, because you'd need to commit the new version of any submodule in the main project when you change the commit that the submodule is meant to be at."
This would be a natural point to update the files in public/assets.)
You say that your test hook isn't being run - that may be simply because you have the name wrong.
The update hook must be an executable file called .git/hooks/update (n.b.
without a .rb suffix).
"Similarly, a post-commit hook must be .git/hooks/post-commit."
"You shouldn't create hooks in any particular submodule for this task, since the action the hook will be taking is specific to the main project."
"Because of that, it doesn't really matter whether the change you're worried about it due to committing a new version of the submodules or just updating any random file."
"For writing hooks, you'll find the official githooks documentation useful, and possibly these additional tips."
"Q:

Please explain this delete top 100 SQL syntax

Basically I want to do this:
delete top( 100 ) from table order by id asc

but MS SQL doesn't allow order in this position
The common solution seems to be this:
DELETE table WHERE id IN(SELECT TOP (100) id FROM table ORDER BY id asc)

But I also found this method here:
delete table from (select top (100) * from table order by id asc) table

which has a much better estimated execution plan (74:26)."
"Unfortunately I don't really understand the syntax, please can some one explain it to me?"
Always interested in any other methods to achieve the same result as well.
"EDIT: I'm still not getting it I'm afraid, I want to be able to read the query as I read the first two which are practically English."
"The above queries to me are:
delete the top 100 records from table, with the records ordered by id ascending
delete the top 100 records from table where id is anyone of (this lot of ids)
delete table from (this lot of records) table

I can't change the third one into a logical English sentence..."
"I guess what I'm trying to get at is how does this turn into ""delete from table (this lot of records)""."
The 'from' seems to be in an illogical position and the second mention of 'table' is logically superfluous (to me).
"A:

This is explained well here  (The article talks about using a view but I presume the same logic must apply to your query if you are getting a better execution plan)

the first one reads the “deleted”
  portion of the table twice."
"Once to identify
  the rows to delete and then once more
  to perform the delete."
The second one avoids this.
Edit This seems to be more a question about syntax.
The syntax for delete is described here.
"The relevant bit is
DELETE 
    [ FROM ]
    { <object> | rowset_function_limited 
    }
    [ FROM <table_source> [ ,...n ] ] 

Your query is 
delete alias 
from 
    (select top (100) * 
     from table 
     order by id asc) alias

You are using a derived table so need the FROM <table_source>."
You are omitting the first optional FROM.
"A:

What you are looking to do is a technique called a Fast Ordered Delete."
"Take a look at the following Blog post: Performing Fast SQL Server Delete operations

A:

The delete command takes several similar forms, as the from keyword is optional, and the deletion table can be specified separate from the query selecting the records:
delete table where ...

delete from table where ...

delete table from <query...>

delete from table from <query...>

The idea with the last two ones is that you can first define which table to delete from, then you can specify a query that picks out the records to delete."
"The query can join in other tables, that's why you would need to separately define from which table to delete."
The query that you found just uses a subquery to pick out the records to delete.

"TOKYO, March 24."
/ITAR-TASS/.
"The majority of Japanese believe that Tokyo should pursue a more independent policy in connection with the crisis around Ukraine, and should not just tighten sanctions against Russia together with the West, according to a public opinion poll conducted by the Nikkei Research centre and TV Tokyo."
"The poll was conducted by telephone by a random sample method among 1,500 citizens of the country."
Only 31% of those polled supported the “tightening of sanctions against Russia in coordination with the United States and European Union.
"At the same time, 52% of respondents believe that Japan, in connection with the situation around Ukraine, should pursue “an independent diplomatic policy”, taking into account the importance of negotiations with Russia on the territorial issue and other factors."
The Japanese government’s attitude towards the situation over Crimea is more reserved than that of its Western partners.
"After the signing of the agreement on the peninsula’s accession to Russia, Tokyo, however, announced the suspension of the consultations with Moscow on easing visa restrictions and froze the beginning of talks on a number of documents."
"However, Japanese government representatives have said that these measures are limited and do not affect economic relations."
This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No.
"2001-1129 filed on Jan. 9, 2001, in the Korean Industrial Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference."

"Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a tilt compensation method and an apparatus therefor, and more particularly, to a method of compensating for the tilt of an optical recording medium in which the tilt margin is between 0 and 0.0052, that is, 0 less than tilt margin less than 0.0052, and an apparatus used therefor."

"Description of the Related Art
When an optical disc such as a DVD or a CD-RW used for high density recording is tilted, an error is generated during recording or reproducing data according to a degree of tilt."
"When the disc is tilted severely, recording or reproducing of data itself is difficult."
"Table 1 below shows how margin changes, with respect to the characteristic of light and the change in tilt and thickness of an optical disc at a data recording surface thereof, according to a change in numerical aperture (NA), may affect a process of recording data on the optical disc."
"As shown in the table, when the numeral aperture increases, a spot size decreases so that the data recording capacity is increased."
"However, it is also shown that the depth of focus and margin of disc tilt are reduced."
A new optical disc named as a DDCD (double density CD) has been suggested.
The DDCD uses the same wavelength as the wavelength used for an existing CD while using an objective lens having a larger NA and having a small track pitch.
"Also, the NA of a DDCD is different from that of an existing DVD (digital versatile disc)."
"Thus, a tilt margin of the DDCD is clearly different from that of the existing CD or DVD."
"Table 2 shows the characteristics of a CD, a DDCD and a DVD."
"In Table 2, the NA of the DDCD is 0.50 for reading only, that is, for reproducing only and 0.55 when used for both reading and recording."
The NA of the CD is 0.45 for reading only and 0.50 when used for both reading and recording.
The NA of the DVD is 0.60 when used for both reading only and reading and recording together.
It can be seen that the NA of the DDCD is greater than that of the existing CD and less than the existing DVD.
"Table 3 below shows the result of calculation of tilt margin with respect to a CD, DDCD and DVD by using a mathematical formula (xcex/tNA3; where xe2x80x9ctxe2x80x9d denotes the thickness of a disc) indicating a tilt margin."
It can be seen from Table 3 that the tilt margin of a DDCD is less than that of a CD and 22% less than that of a DVD.
Such a fact can also be seen from FIG.
1.
"In detail, FIG."
1 is a graph showing the cases of different NAs which may have the same tilt margin as that of a DVD.
"In the graph, the horizontal axis denotes wavelength (nm) and the vertical axis denotes the thickness of an optical disc (mm)."
"The first and second lines G1 and G2 indicate a change of the tilt margin of a CD-R/RW when the NA is 0.5 and a change of the tilt margin of a DVD when the NA is 0.6, respectively."
In FIG.
"1, all lines indicating different NAs show the same tilt margins."
"For example, the tilt margins indicated by the first and second lines G1 and G2 are the same."
"The NA of a DDCD is 0.55 for recording and reproducing, and a graph corresponding to this condition is indicated by a projection line which is positioned between the first and second lines G1 and G2."
"Thus, if the tilt margin of a DDCD having a NA of 0.55 is the same as that of a DVD, since the wavelength of a DDCD is 780 nm, the thickness of the DDCD must be about 0.92 mm."
"However, since the thickness of a DDCD is actually 1.2 mm, the tilt margin of the DDCD naturally decreases, which can be seen from the above mathematical formula."
"Therefore, since the tilt margin of DDCD is different from that of CD or DVD, correction for this difference is needed."
"Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a tilt compensation method by which recording is performed by controlling power and/or time needed for recording according to the tilt of an optical recording medium."
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method that adaptively compensates for a recording pulse according to the detected tilt of an optical recording medium.
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a tilt compensating apparatus which performs recording by controlling power and/or time needed to record according to the tilt of an optical recording medium.
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a tilt compensating apparatus to adaptively compensate for a recording pulse according to the detected tilt of an optical recording medium.
"The foregoing and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a method that compensates for a tilt of a recordable and reproducible optical recording medium comprising detecting a tilt of the optical recording medium, and compensating for a recording signal having a predetermined recording pattern by using a predetermined system according to the detected tilt, wherein, when detecting the tilt, the tilt is detected with respect to an optical recording medium in which a tilt margin is greater than 0 and less than 0.0052 (0 less than tilt margin less than 0.0052)."
The foregoing and other objects are also achieved by providing a method that compensates for a tilt of an optical recording medium when input data is recorded as a mark and a space by a recording pulse having a predetermined recording pattern.
"The method comprises detecting a tilt of the optical recording medium, and adaptively compensating for the recording pattern according to the detected tilt by using a memory, where a recording power and/or time compensating for the amount of shift of the recording pattern and the length and width of a mark according to the tilt and/or the length of the mark is stored, wherein, during detecting the tilt, the tilt is detected with respect to an optical recording medium in which a tilt margin is greater than 0 and less than 0.0052 (0 less than tilt margin less than 0.0052)."
"The foregoing and other objects may also be achieved by providing an apparatus that compensates for a tilt of a recordable and reproducible optical recording medium comprising a tilt detector detecting a tilt of the optical recording medium, and a recording compensator compensating for a recording signal having a predetermined recording pattern by using a predetermined system according to the tilt detected by the tilt detector, wherein the tilt detector detects the tilt with respect to an optical recording medium in which a tilt margin is greater than 0 and less than 0.0052 (0 less than tilt margin less than 0.0052) and the recording compensator compensates for the detected tilt."
"The foregoing and other objects may also be achieved by providing an apparatus that compensates for a tilt of an optical recording medium when input data is recorded as a mark and a space by a recording pulse having a predetermined recording pattern, the apparatus comprising a tilt detector detecting a tilt of the optical recording medium, and a recording compensator adaptively compensating for the recording pattern according to the tilt detected by the tilt detector by using a memory where a recording power and/or time compensating for the amount of shift of the recording pattern and the length and width of a mark according to the tilt and/or the length of the mark is stored, wherein the tilt detector detects the tilt with respect to an optical recording medium in which a tilt margin is greater than 0 and less than 0.0052 (0 less than tilt margin less than 0.0052) and the recording compensator compensates for the detected tilt."
"U.S. authorities have identified a suspect in last year's ""Vault 7"" leaks of CIA hacking and electronic surveillance tools used in foreign espionage operations, reports the Washington Post."
"The Vault 7 release - a series of 24 documents which began to publish on March 7, 2017 - reveal that the CIA had a wide variety of tools to use against adversaries, including the ability to ""spoof"" its malware to appear as though it was created by a foreign intelligence agency, as well as the ability to take control of Samsung Smart TV's and surveil a target using a ""Fake Off"" mode in which they appear to be powered down while eavesdropping."
The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency.
"Each technique it has created forms a ""fingerprint"" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity."
...
The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.
"With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from."
"UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques."
"-WikiLeaks

Joshua Adam Schulte, 29, a former employee in the CIA's Engineering Development Group, is believed to have provided the agency's top-secret cyber warfare tools to WikiLeaks - according to a disclosure by federal prosecutors at a January hearing in a Manhattan court on unrelated charges of possessing, receiving and transporting child pornography."
"Schulte, who has been in jail for months, has pleaded not guilty on the child porn charges."
"Schulte previously worked for the NSA before joining the CIA, then ""left the intelligence community in 2016 and took a job in the private sector,"" according to a statement reviewed by The Post."
Schulte also claimed that he reported “incompetent management and bureaucracy” at the CIA to that agency’s inspector general as well as a congressional oversight committee.
"That painted him as a disgruntled employee, he said, and when he left the CIA in 2016, suspicion fell upon him as “the only one to have recently departed [the CIA engineering group] on poor terms,” Schulte wrote."
"-WaPo

Prosecutors allege that they found a large collection of child pornography on a server maintained by Schulte, however his attorneys argue that anywhere from 50 to 100 people had access to it, which Schulte set up several years ago to share movies and other digital files."
"Federal authorities searched Schulte’s apartment in New York last year and obtained personal computer equipment, notebooks and handwritten notes, according to a copy of the search warrant reviewed by The Washington Post."
But that failed to provide the evidence that prosecutors needed to indict Schulte with illegally giving the information to WikiLeaks.
"-WaPo

And while Schulte ""remains a target of that investigation,"" prosecutor Matthew Laroche, assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York, said that the investigation is ""ongoing."""
"Part of that investigation, reports WaPo, is analyzing whether the Tor network - which allows internet users to hide their location (in theory) ""was used in transmitting classified information."""
"In other hearings in Schulte’s case, prosecutors have alleged that he used Tor at his New York apartment, but they have provided no evidence that he did so to disclose classified information."
Schulte’s attorneys have said that Tor is used for all kinds of communications and have maintained that he played no role in the Vault 7 leaks.
"-WaPo

“Due to these unfortunate coincidences the FBI ultimately made the snap judgment that I was guilty of the leaks and targeted me,” Schulte said."
"He has launched Facebook and GoFundMe pages to raise money for his defense, as well as post articles critical of the criminal justice system."
"As The Post notes, the Vault 7 release was one of the most significant leaks in the CIA's history, ""exposing secret cyberweapons and spying techniques that might be used against the United States, according to current and former intelligence officials."""
"The CIA's toy chest includes:

Tools code named ""Marble"" can misdirect forensic investigators from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to their agency by inserted code fragments in foreign languages."
The tool was in use as recently as 2016.
"Per the WikiLeaks release:

""The source code shows that Marble has test examples not just in English but also in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi."
"This would permit a forensic attribution double game, for example by pretending that the spoken language of the malware creator was not American English, but Chinese, but then showing attempts to conceal the use of Chinese, drawing forensic investigators even more strongly to the wrong conclusion, --- but there are other possibilities, such as hiding fake error messages."""
iPads / iPhones / Android devices and Smart TV’s are all susceptible to hacks and malware.
"The agency's ""Dark Matter"" project reveals that the CIA has been bugging “factory fresh” iPhones since at least 2008 through suppliers."
"Another, ""Sonic Screwdriver"" allows the CIA to execute code on a Mac laptop or desktop while it's booting up."
"The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell’s 1984, but “Weeping Angel”, developed by the CIA’s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization."
"The Obama administration promised to disclose all serious vulnerabilities they found to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers."
The US Government broke that commitment.
"""Year Zero"" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments."
Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals.
The Frankfurt consulate is a major CIA hacking base of operations.
"In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa."
"CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ( ""Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe"" or CCIE) are given diplomatic (""black"") passports and State Department cover."
Instant messaging encryption is a joke.
"These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the ""smart"" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied."
The CIA laughs at Anti-Virus / Anti-Malware programs.

"Yesterday, Kazakhstan was among the rapidly developing republics of former USSR."
"However, the world recession has given an estimate for the genuine price of the nation’s “success”, where the major vector of economic development was the export of mineral resources."
Is Washington at the End of the Rope with Venezuela?
The silence is almost deafening.
Is it the quiet before the storm?
– Or is the US giving up on Venezuela?
I don’t think so.
"It’s more like a regrouping after a first defeat, well, it’s a multiple defeat, if we start counting since the failed coup attempt against Hugo Chavez on 11 April 2002."
"However, Washington is not giving up."
The first blows come flying.
"Pompeo to Maduro – open your borders for humanitarian aid, or else…."
"which implies the usual, “all options are on the table – ’humanitarian’ military intervention is an option”."
"Washington – April 10, 2019, high level US and South American (members of the infamous and nefarious Lima Group, naturally) politicians and military held a secret meeting about the strategic next steps to subdue Venezuela, how to “regime-change” the Maduro Government, by ‘military options’, as reported by investigative journalist Max Blumenthal."
The meeting was dubbed ‘Assessing the Use of Military Force in Venezuela.’ It was hosted by the DC-based neoliberal thinktank the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"Venezuela’s ambassador to the UN, Samuel Moncada, denounces Trump’s preparations for war to the entire UN community."
"The UN Community is increasingly taking note of the atrocities and lawlessness of the one rogue UN member that has the arrogance of thinking and acting as if it were above the law, above every law, even the laws made by its own lawmakers, the United States of America."
"In the context of the failed coup attempt on Venezuela, a group of about 60 UN members formed, including Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran and many more, representing about half of the world population, in support of Venezuela and especially in support of the UN Charter."
"The group requests and will enhance actions for UN members to respect the UN principles, the laws and rules upon which the United Nations were created almost 75 years ago."
This is a new twist within the UN body.
"On 11 April, US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, met in Washington with 16 ministers of finance and representatives of 20 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Germany, Guatemala, Guyana, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Portugal, Peru, Spain, and the UK) – to enhance the support of some 50 countries of the self-declared president Juan Guaidó, and how to support Venezuela, once the Maduro Government “is gone”."
"– Hilarious, if it wasn’t so serious."
"It is as if these, otherwise smart people, were falling into the trap of Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s Propaganda Minister – if a lie is repeated enough, it becomes the truth."
"Indeed, there is no other country in recent history that emulates Hitler and his approaches to world dominance by manipulation as well as Washington."
"And indeed, it is not quite clear, who was teaching whom."
"Venezuela’s Vice-president, Delcy Rodriguez, denounces the preparation of a military intervention in Venezuela by the US, Colombia and Brazil."
"She warns the world from a humanitarian disaster if the global community, allows the United States and its minions to interfere in Venezuela."
"Mexico’s new President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), also vehemently rejects any interference in Venezuela – and offers his Government’s services to mediate a dialogue between the Maduro Government and the opposition, a dialogue to which President Maduro has invited the opposition already many times."
To no avail.
"Mostly because the orders from Washington are clear, no dialogue – no compromise, the Maduro Government must be go."
"We will inject the necessary capital into the inefficient oil industry, and our petrol corporations are eager to revive Venezuela’s hydrocarbon industry and make it profitable again."
"These are the bold and honest words of John Bolton, US National security Adviser."
Let’s see where all this hoopla may lead.
"If it sounds like wishful thinking, it is wishful thinking."
"—-

Even though the true media hero, Julian Assange is for totally illegal reasons behind bars in the UK."
"And this because laws are made in Washington as Washington sees fit, as Trump signs papers, shows them on TV and they becomes law – and laws of the US are applied throughout the US vassalic world, and especially by its poodle puppets in London."
Never mind this minor detail of human derailment.
"More importantly, it seems that Mr. Assange’s spirit and that of his creation of truth telling, Wikileaks, is increasingly reflected by politicians and journalists – who, though somehow coopted into the ‘system’, feel discomfort with this very system and decide to leak so-called classified information into the non-mainstream truth-telling media."
A classical case may be the secret ‘RoundTable’ that took place in Washington on 10 April to discuss the fate of Venezuela.
The news about it was first published by the Grayzone portal on 13 April.
Mr. Blumenthal has obtained the information along with a “check-in list” of the high-flying participants to this private ‘round-table’.
"When confronted and asked for interviews on the event, most members on the list were surprised, even stunned, and refused to talk."
Somebody from inside must have leaked the information about the clandestine meeting.
"On a totally different issue, but equally important for the concept and philosophy of leaking information to the outside world, is the recent disclosure – “leak” – by someone in the French military that sophisticated French weaponry was used by Saudi Arabia to attack and kill defenseless Yemenis."
"And this, although the French – and especially Roi Macron himself, has always denied that the French were participating offensively in this also illegal US-UK-NATO proxy war."
The French narrative was and is that France’s weapons were only defensive.
"Sounds as stupid as calling the US War Ministry, the Ministry of Defense."
"Are we entering a Leak-zone (no pun intended) – an epoch of leaking, of divulging ‘secret’ and classified information?"
Have we had enough impunity?
It’s time to stop it.
What is this “classified” and secret information anyway?
"In a so-called Democracy – why are the elected government officials privileged to hold on to secret information, unknown to the public who lives under the illusion that they elected them, and – more importantly, or even worse – the public, who pays for them."
"Can’t you see, dear People, what aberration of “democracy” we have moved into?"
"– Please, just open your eyes and see all these contradictions, contradictions for us, but they serve the chosen- and you believe elected-by-you – elite, lining their pockets and increasing their power."
Now the public must know the truth.
This new Leak-Culture may take hold.
"– If so, its high time, but never too late."
"It would be another sign towards the empire heaving on its last breath, or as Andrew Vltchek so adroitly puts it, when he describing the ultimate crime of the lawless London gang, the police manhandling a sick and defenseless Julian Assange, “By dragging him from the embassy into a police van, it [the empire] has admitted that it already has begun sewing its own funeral gown.”
—

Back to Venezuela."
Has Washington given up?
Most likely not.
Although their first coup attempt has failed.
The Venezuelan military did not defect.
"Despite Trump’s warning, even threats, they stood and still stand behind Nicolás Maduro."
The humanitarian aid trucks at the border in Cúcuta did not cross into Venezuela.
"In fact, they were burned by the very opposition, hoping to make believe that Maduro’s troops put them on fire."
No.
They were indeed the opposition forces and their allies in Colombia.
"Ironically, the mayor of Cúcuta, after the humanitarian aid stayed stuck at the border, asked Colombian President Duque, whether he, the mayor, might distribute the aid among the poor people of Cúcuta, because this aid was more needed in Cúcuta than in Venezuela."
"Second, Juan Guaidó was never able to mobilize the crowds as Washington expected."
"Guaidó, a US lackey in the first place, lacks any charisma."
He does not appeal even to the majority of Venezuela’s opposition.
"So, he is a dead horse."
Bad choice by Washington.
"Third, a direct military intervention seems unlikely – at least at this point – as Russia quietly but with considerable force has made known her presence in the country."
And so does China.
"Though China may not have sent military personnel, China’s position was and is: Don’t mess with Venezuela."
China and Russia have both huge investments in Venezuela’s hydrocarbon industry.
"In the meantime, Bolton and Pompeo have already accused, in addition to Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua as spreading ‘socialism’ in the region."
That’s their crime.
"It’s now in the open – it’s not just the oil, it’s also ideology."
They are going to be sanctioned.
"In Cuba invoking again the 1996 Helms–Burton Act, under which foreign companies are prohibited from doing business in Cuba, lest they are prevented from doing business in the US."
"In addition, the amount of money Cuban American’s may send home is again limited, after Obama lifted the restrictions."
– And exile Cubans – mostly applying to those in Florida – may now sue Cuba in US courts for confiscated and nationalized land after the revolution.
And that after 60 years.
"I wonder, what US courts have to meddle in Cuba."
This latest US arrogance stinks to heaven.
Will the world smell it?
– Is Washington at the end of the rope with Venezuela?
– Will see.
Not voluntarily; that’s for sure.

Why Site Hoardings Are An Important Part Of Community Engagement

by Shannell Davies
on 29th November 2018

Although construction site hoardings are sometimes treated as a temporary, disposable part of the construction process, they represent a tremendous opportunity to positively engage nearby residents and boost the contractor’s reputation."
"It is an unavoidable fact that initiating any building project automatically enters the construction company into a dialogue with the local community, whether the contractor takes ownership of the situation or not."
"Plain, undecorated hoardings may be functionally acceptable – but with extra care, these could be used to improve public relations, engage local residents and improve brand equity."
"Giving a voice to the local community

Often construction works are seen as an imposition by the local residents, who may feel as though an unsolicited outside force has arrived to fill their environment with machinery, scaffolding, noise, and disruption."
They are also likely to feel that there is nothing they can do about it – a situation likely to breed resentment and complaints.
"By involving the neighbours in decisions on the design of the site hoardings, a contractor can give them some input in the process; it may be that they would be prepared to tolerate or react positively to the presence of the works in their environment if the hoarding graphics displayed something appealing, an image of local importance, or any other subject of their choice."
"By initiating talks or forums with the town hall, local council, or even by polling residents on social media, a construction company can make the locals feel as though they are being listened to and erect hoardings that everybody agrees are more appropriate for the area."
"Reducing potential delays and expenses

The majority of contractors work in a manner that is considerate of residents’ needs, attempting to keep noise, dust, and disruption to a minimum."
"However, if complaints do arise, it’s important to make sure that they don’t delay the work or cause too much unnecessary expense – and hoarding graphics have a part to play in this, too."
"Sometimes, badly-judged or entirely undecorated and ugly hoardings can cause neighbours to complain, forcing a time-consuming and potentially expensive process of redesigning and reprinting the graphics – a situation that could have been avoided by speaking to the locals beforehand and asking for their input."
"Early discussions can negate these kinds of problems, but to be on the safe side, you could even adopt a policy of approachability into the designs themselves."
"By using site hoardings to display contact details, a construction company can invite potentially unhappy locals to speak with the site manager or head office to resolve the issue directly and discreetly – and not leave them to complain to the council or local press."
"Conveying the nature of the project

Construction projects are sometimes undertaken without much communication to the neighbours as to what is actually being built; often, it’s not always easy for residents in proximity to the site to become aware of the planning stages of a project (aside from the standard planning applications and notices), and are thus expected to tolerate building works in their environment despite having no idea what is happening."
"Hoardings, then, are a great opportunity to very clearly illustrate how the local community can expect the finished work to look – and sometimes ideas that may not sound too appealing on paper can be made more palatable by visualising the idea with some artwork to show that the proposed building could look very attractive when completed."
"Hoardings can in some circumstances also be used to generate interest for the client’s business; in the case of a block of flats, appealing promotional artwork around the building site could prime the local community to be excited about the new residential opportunities and to make enquiries – improving the standing of the contractor in the eyes of both the local inhabitants and the client."
"Mitigating controversy

Sometimes, regrettably, a construction contract may come with a pre-existing dispute – perhaps the local community is unhappy about their tax money being deployed on a project they don’t believe to be a priority, or there might be disagreement about the environmental impact of the building work in a particular location."
"Even though these issues may have been under discussion long before the construction company arrives to begin their work, it may well be the contractor who bears the brunt of much of the local displeasure."
"The site hoardings, however, are an opportunity to diminish potential ill-feeling and communicate with positive messaging."
"The printed designs on the hoardings could explain the beneficial impact of the work being undertaken for the local community, and emphasise the contractor’s dedication to cultural sensitivity and environmental protection."
"In other words, a construction company can show that they have been listening."
"In a sense, the hoardings of a building site are the “face” of a contractor; where the plans, contracts, and the construction work itself are often obfuscated from public view, the site hoardings are the one thing prominently on show for all to see – so why present a blank board?"
"Overall, hoarding graphics represent a tremendous opportunity to increase brand awareness and equity."
"In time, a construction company can build an emotional association that their business cares about the communities in which it works, listens to the concerns of residents and is invested in the future of local people."
"Reducing Tensions in the Layers of Organizations

by Paul Hobcraft

The really hard part of managing in larger organizations is in managing the layers and competing forces."
"Often we forget to reinforce acceptable behaviours, we leave role structures lose and incomplete and we set deliverables in often ‘woolly’ ways."
This just promotes uncertainly and it is not an adaptive organization in leaving this so open.
These unnatural built-in tensions create this shearing effect.
"They grind against each other, like tectonic plates that force further disruption and upheaval."
These different layers actually require several levels of reconfiguration designed into the organization.
"One really critical one to address and to ‘kill off,’ is the pressure of time."
Time horizons to achieve different tasks often cannot be ‘legislated’ or ‘dictated’ but sadly they are forced on reluctant innovators responsible for delivery of new concepts.
"We need to re-establish the difference between goals– within a certain period covered (one year), objectives– attained later but are progressed within the period and finally ideals– those unattainable but clearly possible concepts, that progress at slower rates and go well beyond normal goals."
"Innovation works within this environment, actually it will thrive."
"Not just the incremental, but the radical, disruptive and breakthrough innovation craved for by the top management, can finally have a ‘decent’ time horizon to be managed through."
"Planning needs to account for all three horizons and publically discussed, irrespective of the industry you are in, it does not matter if you are building planes or developing food products."
We really should stop pretending that innovation is not so hard and actually state it is often incompatible to much of what we perform on a daily basis.
"The task of managing intangibles (unknowns) alongside tangibles (known’s) needs greater appreciation of their complexities, and the difficulties of balancing the two for achieving a ‘decent’ result."
"Leadership, I believe, would need to understand innovation far more in this demanding environment of enquiry."
No wonder it is often ducked and just vaguely talked about as much of innovation understanding is still poorly understood in its impacts and effect.
"The opportunity of the network economy

Again, the realization of the growing web of networks that we are constantly engaging with, is become a growing part of the new more adaptive innovating enterprise."
"We need to encourage more empowerment to engage with outside parties, to explore, to investigate, to bring in and then diffuse and disperse in new ways."
For this we need to design around more absorptive capacity I’ve often written about.
"Reducing activities and replacing these with outcome orientation

Innovation is no different from what we expect from efficiency or effectiveness; we want to see the outcomes."
We have struggled on many parts of establishing the really good metrics for judging innovation.
They seem to get lost within organizations.
"Part of the innovation activities has been assigned to some other cost centre, or the capacity was already established and we often don’t break these down and assign these clearly enough to the different activities, we should, but into outcome orientation ones."
Were the activities contributing to efficiency or innovation?
We judge these through effectiveness of the outcome.
We need to balance existing performance engines for repeatable everyday tasks with innovation delivery engines for new activities to make our organizations function more effectively.
"Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble have offered some thoughts on this at the implementation stage, although they are still needs more examination."
"As Scott Anthony points out in his article “Negotiating Innovation and Control’ on the different ways to balance tension there is one, in my opinion, that needs deeper investigation and development and that is the ‘ambidextrous’ one."
"This makes distinctions but links the parts of the whole organization by developing competing frames, not competing forces."
Roger Martin suggests in one of his books “The Opposable Mind” that we need to develop “integrative thinking” as part of this need to change.
Ecosystems often reflect the shearing effect.
In any environment the ‘rates of exchange’ of the different components or constituents operate at different speeds.
"Interactions occur more at your own level of contribution, the different layers sometimes you are simply oblivious too or ignore."
The ‘in-spite of’ syndrome kicks in.
"Sometimes though, something catastrophic does occurs and you have to pay attention ( a merger, layoffs, threat of closure) but the real reality is, different layers within organizations tend to be often simply oblivious, even impervious, to necessary change and just ‘does its job’."
"Maybe then, this is why so many organizations seem dysfunctional but do continue to survive, to limp along, until something really does disrupt their world as the existing ecosystem just seems to allow different interactions and speeds."
Can we not alter this though in more thoughtful ways.
than the ‘carrot and the stick’ approach or ‘fear and retribution’ methodologies often employed to achieve results?
"The worrying thing is any dynamics within the system are dominated by the slow components, and the rapid components simply have to follow along."
"“Slow constrains quick, slow controls quick”."
"The only way to ensure a speeding up is to be coherent on the purpose, clarify the bounds and governing principles that need to be enacted."
"Consciously working on our dysfunctional points would help innovation

Simply by consciously working on all the dysfunction points within an organization will certainly reduce the tensions, reduce the shearing and allow the organization in all its layers to ‘react’ and be allowed to come back into a balance, where innovation sits equally alongside efficiency, especially if both focus on outcome orientation and that certainly is not the current business as usual we see today."
Freeing up valuable time to innovate.
"Perhaps working on these dysfunction spots it might free up some real, much needed space for innovation to take a deeper hold."
"It does seem with all the suggested emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness, if you accept this argument, it might be a good idea to have innovation alongside, as it does thrives more when there is creative tensions around!"
This article is part two (of two blogs) on built-in tensions within organizations.
"Paul Hobcraft runs Agility Innovation, an advisory business that stimulates sound innovation practice, researches topics that relate to innovation for the future, as well as aligning innovation to organizations core capabilities."
"Q:

Inserting data from *.txt file into assoc array

I have a text file 'test.txt' having  fruitnames and their scientific names in separate lines."
"I want to create an array as  
$FRUIT_NAME ( fruit1=>""apple, 
              SNfruit1=>""Pyrus malus"",  
              fruit2=>""mango"", 
              SNfruit2=>""Mangifera indica""  ...  )

But, I am getting blank values in SNfruit1, SNfruit2.."
"Here is the 'test.txt'
SNapple=""Pyrus malus"" 
SNmango=""Mangifera indica"" 
SNbanana=""Musa paradisicum"" 
SNorange=""Citrus aurantium"" 
SNDefault=""No SN"" 
fruit1=""apple|$SNapple"" 
fruit2=""mango|$SNmango"" 
fruit3=""banana|$SNbanana"" 
fruit4=""orange|$SNorange"" 
veg1=""potato"" 
veg2=""cauliflower""

Here is the code file 'test.php':
$lines=explode(""\n"", file_get_contents('test.txt'));

$FRUIT_NAME=[] ;
$result=[];
for($i=0; $i<count($lines); $i++)
{   if (strpos($lines[$i], '=') !== false) 
    {  
        $link = explode('=', $lines[$i], 2); 
        if (strpos(substr($lines[$i], 0, 2), 'SN') !== false)
           $result[str_replace('""',"""",$link[0])] = $link[1];
        else
        {   $FName=$link[1];
           if (strpos($link[1], '|') !== false)
              {  
                $LINK = explode('|$', $link[1]); 
                $FName=$LINK[0];
                $SN=str_replace('""',"""",$LINK[1]);
              }
           else $SN=""SNDefault"" ;

           $FRUIT_NAME[$link[0]] = $FName ;
           //$FRUIT_NAME[""SN"".$link[0]] = $SN ;
           $FRUIT_NAME['SN'.$link[0]] = $result[$SN] ;
        }
    }
}

foreach ($result as $key => $value) echo ""$key::$value""."
"'<br>';

echo '============================================';

foreach ($FRUIT_NAME as $key => $value) echo ""$key::$value""."
"'<br>';  

A:

Re-write your middle if-else statement:
if (strpos(substr($lines[$i], 0, 2), 'SN') !== false)
    $result[str_replace('""',"""",$link[0])] = $link[1];
else

with 
if (strpos(substr($lines[$i], 0, 2), 'SN') !== false){ 
   $result[$link[0]] = str_replace('""',"""",$link[1]);
}

and 
$FName=$link[1];
if (strpos($link[1], '|') !== false) {  
    $LINK = explode('|$', $link[1]); 
    $FName=$LINK[0];
    $SN=str_replace('""',"""",$LINK[1]);
} else $SN=""SNDefault"" ;

$FRUIT_NAME[$link[0]] = $FName ; 
$FRUIT_NAME['SN'.$link[0]] = $result[$SN] ;

with 
$link[1] = str_replace('""','',$link[1]);

if (strpos($link[1], '|$') !== false) {  
     $sublink = explode('|$', $link[1]); 
     $FRUIT_NAME[$link[0]] = $sublink[0]; 
     $FRUIT_NAME[""SN"".$link[0]] = $result[trim($sublink[1])];
} else { 
    $FRUIT_NAME[$link[0]] = $link[1] ; 
} 

then outputs will be:
SNapple::Pyrus malus
SNmango::Mangifera indica
SNbanana::Musa paradisicum
SNorange::Citrus aurantium
SNDefault::No SN
============================================
fruit1::apple
SNfruit1::Pyrus malus
fruit2::mango
SNfruit2::Mangifera indica
fruit3::banana
SNfruit3::Musa paradisicum
fruit4::orange
SNfruit4::Citrus aurantium
veg1::potato
veg2::cauliflower

The problem was in true and false parts."
"In true you did str_replace of wrong element, that's why you've received values like ""apple instead of clean apple."
"In false part you didn't trim, that's why indexes were incorrect and so your $FRUIT_NAME was built not so correctly."
Note: echo '============================================'.

"In a cloud computing scenario, magnetic disk data of a virtual machine (Virtual Machine, VM), including data of a system disk and of a data disk, is under a security risk."
"If full disk encryption is performed on VM data and a key is held by a user, unauthorized personnel are incapable of obtaining data of the user."
"In this way, sensitive data of the user in the cloud is protected to a great degree."
"A conventional full disk encryption technology, as a solution to terminal security, is already mature."
"In the conventional technology, before booting an operation system, that is, in a pre-boot (Pre-boot) phase, a key may be generated by a boot loader (boot loader) program according to a password input by the user."
Data on the magnetic disk is decrypted by use of the key.
"The decrypted data includes an operation system (Operation System, OS), and the operation system may be booted after being decrypted."
"In the foregoing conventional full disk encryption technology, the user executes an operation on a single terminal, and the boot loader program may obtain the key."
"However, in a cloud application scenario, a key needed by the VM needs to be obtained from an external cloud platform."
"Before the operation system of the VM is booted, the VM does not have an IP address and is incapable of communicating with the outside, thereby being incapable of obtaining the key."
"Therefore, the operation system of the VM cannot be booted, which causes the VM to be halted in the pre-boot phase."

"Man mauled by tiger at NYC zoo pleads not guilty

A man who jumped into a tiger den at the Bronx Zoo and was mauled by a 400-pound animal told police, “Everyone makes choices,” a court complaint says."
"David Villalobos, 25, of Mahopac, was arraigned Friday in a Bronx courthouse and pleaded not guilty to trespassing charges."
"On Sept. 21, Villalobos jumped from a monorail train that tours the zoo’s Wild Asia exhibit."
He cleared a 16-foot-high fence and was attacked and dragged by a Siberian tiger named Bashuta.
"Villalobos suffered bites on his arms, legs, shoulders and back."
"He also had a broken right shoulder, right rib, right ankle and pelvis and a collapsed lung."
"In the complaint, police Sgt."
"Peter Monopoli says that when Villalobos was asked why he jumped, he said, “Everyone makes choices and we have our reasons in life why we do things.”

He told another investigator, “I was testing my natural fear, you would not understand,” the complaint says."
"“It is a spiritual thing, I wanted to be at one with the tiger.”

Villalobos was alone with the tiger for about 10 minutes before he was rescued by workers who used a fire extinguisher to chase the animal away."
Zoo director Jim Breheny said at the time: “The tiger did nothing wrong.
... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves.” Breheny would not comment Friday on whether the tiger was still at the zoo or whether any safety procedures had been changed since the attack.
"Villalobos’ attorney, Corey Sokoler, would not comment directly on the case but described his client as “a very intelligent young man.”

“He knows and I know this is a very interesting human interest story and people have a lot of questions,” Sokoler said."
"At present fixing anchors cast into concrete consist of a screw threaded element attached to reinforcing rods within the concrete element, into which a threaded bar or other connecting element can be secured."
The threaded bar is used to connect one concrete element to another.
"It is now essential that it such connections are going to fail, due to an earthquake or other building disturbance, that the connection elements fail in a ductile manner to avoid failure of the surrounding concrete in a non-ductile manner."
Currently available fixing anchors do not provide reliable ductile failure.

"British India Steam Navigation Company

British India Steam Navigation Company (""BI"") was formed in 1856 as the Calcutta and Burmah Steam Navigation Company."
"The company had been formed out of Mackinnon, Mackenzie & Co, a trading partnership of the Scots William Mackinnon and Robert Mackenzie, to carry mail between Calcutta and Rangoon."
It became British India SN Co in 1862.
"Under the hand of Lord Inchcape, who had become chairman in 1913, the company became part of the P&O group of companies in 1914 through a complex amalgamation, but continued with its own identity and organisation for another nearly 60 years until 1972, when it was entirely absorbed into P&O."
"As one of the largest shipowners of all time, the company owned more than 500 ships and managed 150 more for other owners."
"At its height in 1922, BI had more than 160 ships in the fleet, many built on Clydeside, Scotland."
"The main shipping routes of the line were: Britain to India, Australia, Kenya, Tanganyika."
"The company ran services from India to Pakistan, Ceylon, Bay of Bengal, Singapore, Malaya, Java, Thailand, Japan, Persian Gulf, East Africa and South Africa."
BI had a long history of service to the British and Indian governments through trooping and other military contracts.
In the last decade of its operational existence BI carried thousands of school children on educational cruises.
"The cargo ship , carrying silver bullion, pig iron and tea, which was sunk at great depth by the  some  southwest of Galway Bay, Ireland, carried the richest cargo of any sunken ship in world history."
"Some of the company's better known passenger ships included , , , , Leicestershire, , the sister ships  and , and  and , and , which was sunk by a terrorist bomb in 1961. 

 of 1956 was the final passenger ship built for BI."
"Serving as a troopship until redundant in 1962, Nevasa was assigned new duties with the BI educational cruise ship flotilla until 1974, when she became surplus and was scrapped in 1975 having earlier been joined in this trade by the more economic Uganda."
The highly popular Uganda was taken up (STUFT) by the British Ministry of Defence in 1982 as a hospital ship during the Falklands war with Argentina.
"Returning to BI's tradition of government service again in 1983 – this time as a troopship – Uganda was ""the last BI"" when finally withdrawn in 1985."
"Dwarka holds the distinction of closing British-India's true ""liner"" services, when withdrawn from the company's Persian Gulf local trades in 1982, in her 35th year."

"VANCOUVER—Canadian actor Cory Monteith, who rose to stardom playing the reluctant quarterback-turned-singer Finn Hudson in the hit television series “Glee,” was found dead Saturday in a Vancouver hotel room."
He was 31.
"Acting Vancouver Police Chief Doug LePard confirmed his death Saturday night, telling a hastily called news conference that the cause of death had yet to be determined, but foul play was not suspected."
He added that investigators believed Monteith died alone.
Police say an autopsy is expected to take place on Monday to determine the cause of death.
"The actor‘s death comes more than three months after he told People magazine he had voluntarily admitted himself into rehab for substance abuse, though police declined to speculate whether there was any connection."
"“We only notified family members about an hour ago, and so we haven’t been able to have those conversations with them,” LePard said, when asked about the possibility Monteith’s death was related to substance abuse."
"“What we can say is that the cause of death wasn’t immediately apparent.”

LePard said Monteith checked into the hotel a week earlier and had been scheduled to check out on Saturday, but when he missed his check-out time, hotel staff entered the room around noon and found his body."
"Video and electronic records from the hotel indicate Monteith entered his room early Saturday morning, and British Columbia’s chief coroner said he‘d been dead for several hours by the time he was found."
LePard said police took the unusual step of summoning the media to head off the inevitable speculation the star‘s death would generate.
"“Obviously, with a celebrity like Mr. Monteith, there’s going to be an extraordinary level of interest in a routine sudden death,” he said."
"“We know there would be a great deal of speculation and probably inaccurate information, so we wanted to provide accurate information as soon as we could.”

LePard also added a personal note about the case."
"“I watched ‘Glee’ regularly with my daughters, and I know there will be shock and sadness in many households with the news of his tragic death,” he said."
"Monteith’s publicist, Melissa Kates, issued a brief written statement shortly after the police news conference."
"“We are so saddened to confirm that the reports on the death of Cory Monteith are accurate,” wrote Kates, who works for the publicity company Viewpoint, based in L.A.

“We are in shock and mourning this tragic loss.”

Monteith, who was born in Calgary and raised in Victoria, joined the cast of “Glee” when the series started in 2009."
His fellow “Glee” cast members took to Twitter shortly after the news broke.
"Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

“I am so saddened to hear about Cory."
"He was such a great guy/Super-kind &warm,” wrote Josh Sussman, who plays Jacob on the show."
“A tragic loss.
"My heart goes out to all his friends & family.”

Nolan Gerard Funk, an actor from Vancouver who joined the “Glee” cast last year, tweeted: “Thanks for always being kind Cory."
You came a long way from hanging on the beaches in Vancouver with the gang pre Glee.
"Sending you love bud.”

And Mark Salling, who plays Puck, wrote simply, “No,” in a tweet that later appeared to have been deleted."
"In April, Monteith told People magazine that he had voluntarily admitted himself into “a treatment facility for substance addiction.”

It wasn’t his first time in rehab."
"He was also treated when he was 19 and had talked openly about his addiction struggles, saying he had a serious problem and took just “anything and everything.”

He told Parade magazine in 2011 that he was “lucky to be alive.”

B.C.’s chief coroner, Lisa Lapointe, said further tests would be needed to determine how Monteith died."
"“The exact nature of those examinations will depend on investigative findings within the next day or two as information is gathered from medical records and discussions with family take place,” she said."
"Before becoming an actor, Monteith worked in Nanaimo, B.C., as a Wal-Mart people greeter, taxicab driver, school bus driver, and roofer."
"Monteith had minor roles in “Final Destination 3,” “Whisper” and “Deck the Halls,” and had a recurring role in “Kyle X.”"
Display banners or other types of elongated display mediums are often utilized to display information in an eye-catching manner.
"For example, it is common practice within the trade-show industry to use such banners to attract potential customers or clients to a particular trade-show display booth."
Trade-show display booths have various sizes and shapes and include a wide range of structural designs.
"For example, trade-show booths often incorporate collapsible, self-standing display structures that define curved display walls."
"For aesthetic reasons, it is desirable to span display banners across the fronts of the curved walls."
Display banners are typically manufactured of flexible materials such as flexible plastic or fabric material.
"Because the banners are generally flexible in nature, rigid frames are often used to provide support for preventing the banners from sagging."
U.S. Pat.
No.
"5,494,369 discloses an exemplary display frame having resilient connectors for interconnecting the various components of the frame."
"Trade-show display banners are also commonly spanned between structures so as to form display ""bridges""."
"Once again, because the banners are typically made of flexible materials, rigid display frames are often used to prevent the banners from sagging."
"The use of rigid frames insures that the banners are presented in a clear, easy to read, and aesthetically pleasing manner."
"Often, the presentation and visibility of the banners is further enhanced through the use of lighting secured behind the banners."
The mobile nature of the trade-show industry presents special concerns to suppliers of rigid display frames.
"For example, one concern relates to providing display frames that can be quickly and easily assembled and disassembled."
Another concern relates to providing display frames that are compact when disassembled.
"A further concern relates to providing display frames that are light weight, substantially rigid when assembled, and capable of providing large graphic display areas."
"Additional concerns relate to providing display frames that are durable, cost effective to manufacture, and aesthetically pleasing."
The present invention addresses these concerns as well as other concerns.
Synthesis of human globin polypeptides mediated by recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors.
"Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2)-based chimeric plasmids that harbored a near-full-length human alpha- or beta-globin cDNA were constructed."
"The cDNAs were spliced into an AAV plasmid, pAAV delta K, downstream from the viral P40 promoter, substituting the capsid gene region."
The correctness of the insertion with regard to the transcription polarity was ascertained by both restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing.
"One of the constructs, pAAVcHBBLCR, contained the erythroid-specific enhancer elements, the locus control region, HS1 and HS2, to ensure an efficient and tissue-specific gene expression."
"Use of a defective complementing helper, pAVXB (Dixit, M.; et al."
"Gene 1991, 104, 253-257.)"
and adenovirus 2 made it possible to prepare recombinant AAVs (rAAVs).
"Infection of human 293 cells (embryonal kidney cell line) with the resultant rAAV (AAVcHBB) and cotransfection of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with the beta-globin construct (pAAVcHBBLCR) and an alpha-globin construct (pAAVcHAB) triggered efficient synthesis of human globin polypeptides in the cells, as analyzed by biochemical and immunohistochemical means."
"The LCR made the construct respond to an inducer, N,N-hexamethylenebisacetamide, the amount of expressed human beta-globin reaching a similar level as the endogenous mouse beta-globin in MEL cells."
"Electrotransfection of mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with the constructs dramatically increased the number of benzidine-positive cells in liquid suspension culture, indicating expression and synthesis of a human hemoglobin in these cells."
"Thus, the rAAV constructs may be useful for gene therapy of hemoglobinopathies."
"Glycol methacrylate embedding for improved morphological, morphometrical, and immunohistochemical investigations under light microscopy: testes as a model."
"Glycol methacrylate (GMA), a water and ethanol miscible plastic resin, is a medium handy to use for light microscopy embedding that has a number of advantages than paraffin embedding."
"The GMA improves the histological, morphometrical, and immunohistochemical evaluations, mainly due to the accurate assessment of cytological details."
"This chapter focuses on our experience in the GMA processing and describes in detail the fixation, embedding, and staining methods that we have been using for testes evaluations."
"Q:

Proving lower bounds by proving upper bounds

The recent breakthrough circuit complexity lower-bound result of Ryan Williams provides a proof technique that uses upper-bound result to prove complexity lower-bounds."
"Suresh Venkat in his answer to this question, Are there any counter-intuitive results in theoretical computer science?, provided two examples of establishing lower-bounds by proving upper-bounds."
What are the other interesting results for proving complexity lower-bounds that was obtained by proving complexity upper-bounds?
Is there any upper-bound conjecture that would imply $NP \not\subseteq P/poly$ (or $P \ne NP$)?
"A:

One could turn the question around and ask what lower bounds aren't proved by proving an upper bound."
"Almost all communication complexity lower bounds (and streaming algorithm lower bound and data structure lower bounds that rely on communication complexity arguments) are proved by showing that a communication protocol can be constructively turned into an encoding scheme, with the length of the encoding depending on the communication complexity of the protocol, and the lower bound for the protocol follows from the fact that you cannot encode all n bit messages using n-1 bits or fewer."
The Razborov-Smolensky circuit lower bounds work by showing how to simulate bounded-depth circuits by low-degree polynomials.
"A couple of candidates of lower bounds that are not proved with an upper bound could be the time hierarchy theorem (although, to get the tightest bounds, one needs an efficient universal turing machine, which is a non-trivial algorithmic task) and the proof of AC0 lower bounds using the switching lemma (but the cleanest proof of the switching lemma uses a counting/incompressibility/Kolmogorov-complexity)

A:

In a weird way, the PCP theorem itself is a good example of proving a lower bound via an upper bound."
"An ""efficient"" randomized strategy for verifying a proof using a constant number of probes of the proof and only $\log n$ random bits leads to a lower bound for approximating the number of satisfied clauses in an instance of 3SAT."
"A:

The incompressibility method is a method based on Kolmogorov complexity to prove lower bounds."
One of the first application of this method was to prove that recognizing palindromes on a Turing machine with a single tape requires quadratic time.
"Loosely speaking, the idea of this method is to describe a procedure to find an input using the information contained in the run of an algorithm solving the problem we consider on this input."
"The better is the procedure, the higher is the lower bound on the original problem."
"Of course, full details can be found in the textbook of Li and Vitanyi."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s aid chief, Mark Green, made an unannounced visit to Raqqa in Syria on Monday, the most senior U.S. civilian official from the Trump administration to visit the war-struck northern city months after it was retaken from Islamic State."
Green was accompanied by head of the U.S. Central Command General Joseph Votel as the United States ramps up post-conflict stabilization in areas where Islamic State has been driven out by American-backed militia.
"The visit comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week signaled an open-ended U.S. military presence in Syria, part of a broader strategy to prevent Islamic State’s resurgence and pave the way for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step aside."
Lessons from conflicts in Libya and Iraq show that unless liberated areas are quickly stabilized they could easily fall back into the hands of militants.
"“We’re at the point where people really do want to go home so this is the moment to seize,” Green, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), said in a phone interview with Reuters after his seven-hour visit to Raqqa and the Ain Issa camp for people displaced by fighting."
"As he drove through the densely built-up city with Votel, Green said he was struck by the devastation to buildings and roads, caused by U.S-led coalition air strikes and militia firing from homes."
"“The devastation goes back as far as you can see,” said Green, “It is almost beyond description.”

Green said he visited a soccer stadium where locker rooms were used as torture chambers by Islamic State."
“You can see a makeshift metal bed where they laid their torture victims right on the bed.
"It was just gruesome, gruesome,” he added."
"But there were also signs of hope with fruit vendors on sidewalks, families walking together and people starting to clear rubble."
"“Despite all of the destruction and all of the damage you still see signs of the human spirit ... and it gives you so much hope,” he said."
"NEW FRONT

U.S. forces in Syria have already faced direct threats from Syrian and Iranian-backed forces, leading to the shoot-down of Iranian drones and a Syrian jet last year, as well as to tensions with Russia."
"In the meantime, Turkey opened a new front in Syria at the weekend launching airstrikes against U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in Afrin province."
"Green said the civilian mission was not to rebuild but to help civilians return home by clearing roadside bombs, and restoring water and electricity."
"“The mission for us is stabilization not reconstruction,” Green emphasized."
"“Our part of it is restoring essential services and there is a lot of work to do,” he added."
Green said he would be traveling to Europe soon to press allies to help.
"Fred Hof, director of the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Harari Center for the Middle East, said it was critical that the United States “seals the victory” in Raqqa through stabilization."
"“You don’t invest three years in defeating ISIS and then fail to implement an obligatory aspect of military doctrine,” said Hof."
"The challenge, he added, was who would be left in command on the ground to ensure rebuilding took place."
Hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition is regulated by phosphorylation of GSK3-β via PI3 K/Akt signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis induced by hypoxia.
"Here, we examined whether phosphorylation of GSK3-β via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt signaling is involved in enhancing the hypoxia-induced EMT in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)."
"Experiments were performed in OSCC cell lines (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, SAS, and HO-1-U-1) under normoxic or hypoxic conditions."
The EMT was assessed by Matrigel invasion assays and wound healing assays.
OSCC cell lines (HSC-2 and HSC-4) overexpressing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α were established to examine the effects of HIF-1α on EMT-related factors.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed to examine phosphorylation of GSK3-β in 33 cases of tongue squamous cell carcinoma.
"Under hypoxic conditions, OSCC cell lines exhibited HIF-1α expression and showed evidence of the EMT."
"In cells overexpressing HIF-1α, the levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-GSK3-β were increased, resulting in induction of the EMT."
Inhibition of GSK3-β phosphorylation suppressed these effects.
"Moreover, the intensity of pGSK3-β staining was significantly increased with cN stage and cTNM stage in patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma."
"Our data showed that the hypoxia-induced EMT in OSCC was enhanced by GSK3-β phosphorylation, suggesting that GSK3-β may be important in the invasion and metastasis of OSCC."

"JUSTICE O'MARA FROSSARD delivered the opinion of the court:

       In this consolidated action involving claims for negligence, wrongful death, and survival

damages, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants Vance Uniformed

Protection Services, Inc. (Vance), and Latessa Diamond."
"Plaintiffs appealed, contending defendants

had a duty to protect against criminal conduct where defendants contracted to provide security

services."
We affirm the judgment of the trial court.
"BACKGROUND

       This case arose from the shooting deaths and injuries that occurred at Navistar International

Transportation Corp. and International Truck and Engine Corp. (Navistar) in Melrose Park, Illinois,
1-06-2009 & 1-06-2126 (cons.)"
"on the morning of February 5, 2001."
"Navistar had hired defendant Vance to provide unarmed,

uniformed security officer service according to the specific terms and conditions of their contract."
Vance employed defendant Diamond as a security officer.
"Prior to February 2001, there was no history of any workplace violence at Navistar's facility."
"The shooter, Willie Baker, had been fired from Navistar in 1995 for theft, but he had never

threatened any Navistar employee before or after his termination."
"Baker was prosecuted for theft,

convicted and scheduled to begin serving a five-month prison sentence on February 6, 2001."
"At about 9:45 a.m. on February 5, 2001, Baker parked in Navistar's visitors' parking lot and

entered an unlocked door of a gate guardhouse station, carrying weapons concealed in a golf bag."
Diamond was on duty there alone and asked if she could help him.
"Baker said he wanted to drop off

the golf bag for an employee."
"While Diamond retrieved the employee directory, Baker put a gun to

her head."
He took Diamond hostage and forced her to walk with him to building 10.
"Building 10

was supposed to be locked, but the door opened without the use of Diamond's keycard."
"Inside, Baker

randomly shot building occupants, killing four and wounding others before killing himself."
"Plaintiffs Garcia, Gale, Aidross, Brus and Wehrheim filed complaints alleging that Baker had

gained entrance to the facility because defendants had been lax in their efforts and negligently failed

to properly secure the premises against intrusion."
Those complaints were ultimately consolidated.
"Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to section 2-1005 of the Code of

Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2-1005 (West 2006)), contending (1) defendants did not owe plaintiffs

a duty to warn or protect them from the criminal acts of Baker; (2) no genuine issue of material fact

existed as to proximate cause; and (3) Baker's criminal acts constituted a superceding, intervening

1-06-2009 & 1-06-2126 (cons.)"
"act that severed any causal relationship between defendants' alleged negligence and the plaintiffs'

injuries and deaths."
"Concerning the lack of duty argument, plaintiffs responded that the duty was created when

Vance voluntarily entered into the security contract."
"Plaintiffs argued that defendants implicitly

agreed to protect plaintiffs when Vance undertook, contractually, responsibility to deter and reduce

certain types of conduct and risks."
"In particular, Vance agreed that its security officers would not

permit discharged employees to enter the premises."
"The pleadings, affidavits and depositions established the following facts."
"On February 4,

2001, Vance began providing unarmed uniformed security officer service at Navistar."
"The contract

stated that the presence of the security officers:

       ""is designed to deter and reduce certain types of conduct and risks."
"However, [Vance

       is] not a law enforcement agency."
"The principal function of the Officers is to

       maintain a presence, to observe and to report."
"[Vance does] not insure or guarantee

       the personal safety of any person or the security of any property."
"[Vance would] not

       be responsible for any theft, damage, destruction, loss of property, personal injury or

       death except due to [Vance's] negligence or willful misconduct, and [Vance would]

       not have any liability arising from the criminal acts of any third parties."""
Vance's security officers were unarmed.
"They used two-way radios to communicate with

each other, and Navistar provided their communication equipment."
"Vance did not design, install or

maintain the keycard system used by Navistar employees to access the various buildings on the

premises."
Navistar was responsible for that system.
"3
1-06-2009 & 1-06-2126 (cons.)"
"Vance and Navistar agreed that post orders would be prepared based on Navistar's needs and

the services Vance provided."
"Any changes to the post orders necessitated by time, need, or any other

purpose had to be in writing and agreed to by both Vance and Navistar."
"According to the post

orders, the security officers were required to patrol Navistar's property and monitor employees and

visitors, vehicle traffic, and inbound or outbound freight."
"Their duties were performed to protect and

prevent loss from fire, theft, sabotage, vandalism, or horseplay."
"They should observe the condition

of various buildings, equipment, and irregularities, including safety or fire hazards, poor

housekeeping, thefts and other security breaches, and report it to supervisory personnel."
"The post

orders required security officers at the gate guardhouse station to observe employees or visitors and

not allow them to bring in items that might be detrimental to Navistar or its employees."
"Furthermore, they should check that people entering the premises had the proper identification to

permit ingress."
Current employees used their keycards to enter through turnstiles.
"A visitor would

be issued passes at the loss prevention trailer or building 1."
"The post orders provided that discharged

employees should not be admitted, and security officers should direct them to the loss prevention

trailer."
"Furthermore, the post orders stated that private deliveries (like food, gifts, flowers, etc.)"
could not be made inside the primary security fence.
"The security officer would have to call the

recipient of the food or gift, who must come to the gate to receive the delivery."
"In her deposition, Diamond testified that when visitors came to Navistar, the security officer

would check their identification and make sure they had a pass."
"Visitors without passes were sent

to the main guard shack or control area."
"According to Diamond, if a security officer was ever

physically threatened, the security officer should report it to a supervisor, the police, or try to escape


                                                    4
1-06-2009 & 1-06-2126 (cons.)"
if possible.
"The security officer's function was to maintain a presence, observe, and report anything

unusual to supervisors."
"As Diamond explained in her deposition, the security officer at the gate

guardhouse was required to exit the guardhouse and check the contents of the trucks, greet visitors,

and check their identification."
"In order to admit trucks, the security officer had to press a button

inside the guardhouse to open the gate."
"The guardhouse had two doors that could be locked from

the inside."
"Out of habit from her previous job as an armed security guard at the Chicago Housing

Authority, Diamond locked the doors if she was inside the gate guardhouse alone."
"However, once

employees and truck traffic started arriving during business hours, she was in and out of the

guardhouse so frequently that she left the doors unlocked."
"Diamond further testified at her deposition that on the date of the shooting, she was inside

the gate guardhouse with both doors locked until she was relieved by two officers when she went

to building 10 to use the restroom."
She testified that she used her keycard to enter building 10.
"She

noticed, however, that the light on the lock never changed from red to green."
"When she exited

building 10, she pulled on the door and noted that it had locked behind her."
"Upon her return to the

guardhouse, the two officers left as a truck was attempting to exit the plant."
"Diamond did not realize

that both doors of the guardhouse were now unlocked."
"Diamond buzzed the gate open so the truck

could drive up to the guardhouse for her inspection."
"After the truck drove away, Diamond went

inside the guardhouse and processed the paperwork."
"She heard the door that she thought was locked

open and then saw Baker at the door inside the guardhouse."
She did not have time to close the gate.
"Baker said he was there to give a friend a golf bag, and Diamond asked him the employee's name

and reached for the employee directory."
"Diamond described how Baker then put a gun to the back

of her head, took her hostage, and made her walk with him to building 10, where he randomly fired

gunshots at occupants of the building.
"The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that defendants

did not owe a duty to warn or protect plaintiffs from criminal acts under the contract terms and did

not voluntarily undertake any such duty."
Plaintiffs appealed.
"ANALYSIS

       In their negligence action, plaintiffs must set out sufficient facts to allege the existence of a

duty owed by defendants to the plaintiffs, a breach of that duty, and an injury proximately resulting

from the breach."
"MacDonald v. Hinton, 361 Ill. App."
"3d 378, 382 (2005)."
"The existence of a

duty–the legal obligation imposed upon one for the benefit of another–is a question of law to be

determined by the court."
"Martin v. McDonald's Corp., 213 Ill. App."
"3d 487, 489 (1991)."
We review a grant of summary judgment by the trial court de novo.
"Jewelers Mutual

Insurance Co. v. Firstar Bank Illinois, 213 Ill. 2d 58, 62 (2004)."
"Summary judgment can only be

entered “if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,

show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to

judgment as a matter of law.” 735 ILCS 5/2-1005(c) (West 2006); Prairie v. University of Chicago

Hospitals, 298 Ill. App."
"3d 316, 319 (1998)."
"The pleadings, depositions and affidavits must be

construed most strictly against the moving party and most liberally in favor of the opponent."
"Purtill

v. Hess, 111 Ill. 2d 229, 240 (1986)."
"Summary judgment is a drastic means of disposing of litigation

and should only be allowed when the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt."

"Plaintiffs contend defendants undertook a duty of care to protect plaintiffs from third-party

criminal acts when defendants were hired to assist Navistar in providing a safe workplace."
"According to the post orders, which were incorporated into the contract terms, Vance was required

to deny discharged employees admission inside Navistar's premises."
"Plaintiffs argue that liability

can arise from the negligent performance of a voluntary undertaking, and Vance negligently

performed the duty to deny entry to discharged employees because Vance's security officer failed to

lock a lockable door."
"According to plaintiffs, Vance is responsible because its negligence increased

the risk of harm to plaintiffs."
"To determine whether a duty exists in a certain instance, a court considers: (1) the reasonable

foreseeability of injury; (2) the likelihood of injury; (3) the magnitude of the burden of guarding

against the injury; and (4) the consequences of placing that burden on the defendant."
"Bajwa v.

Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 208 Ill. 2d 414, 427 (2004)."
"The question of the existence of a duty

turns in large part on public policy considerations."
"Bajwa, 208 Ill. 2d at 427."
"""Ordinarily, a party owes no duty of care to protect another from the harmful or criminal acts

of third persons."""
"MacDonald, 361 Ill. App."
3d at 382.
"There are, however, four exceptions to this

rule: (1) when the parties are in a special relationship–i.e., common carrier/passenger,

innkeeper/guest, business invitor/invitee, or voluntarily custodian/protectee–and the harm is

foreseeable; (2) when an employee is in imminent danger and this is known to the employer; (3)

when a principal fails to warn his agent of an unreasonable risk of harm involved in the agency; and

(4) when any party voluntarily or contractually assumes a duty to protect another from the harmful

acts of a third party."

3d at 382.
"7
1-06-2009 & 1-06-2126 (cons.)"
"The only relevant exception in the instant case is the fourth exception concerning a voluntary

undertaking."
"Our supreme court has utilized section 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts to

analyze voluntary undertaking claims."
"Cross v. Wells Fargo Alarm Services, Inc., 82 Ill. 2d 313, 319

(1980); Pippin v. Chicago Housing Authority, 78 Ill. 2d 204, 210 (1979)."
"Section 324A states:

               ""One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to

       another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person

       or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting

       from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if

               (a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or

               (b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person,

       or

               (c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person

       upon the undertaking."""
Restatement (Second) of Torts §324A (1965).
"Plaintiffs contend that, under a traditional duty analysis, either in conjunction with the

Restatement or separately, the imposition of a duty on defendants to take reasonable steps against

criminal conduct like Baker's is a small burden compared to the potentially severe harm."
"Plaintiffs

argue that defendants's duty arose under subsections (a), (b) and (c) of section 324A."
"Specifically,

plaintiffs argue that: defendants increased the risk of harm when they failed to take reasonable safety

measures by properly locking doors and protecting access points; defendants were employed to fulfill

Navistar's duty to protect its employees from third-party attacks; and Navistar and its employees

relied on defendants ""to secure the facility and exclude feared intruders."""
"Plaintiffs' arguments,

however, are not persuasive."
"8
1-06-2009 & 1-06-2126 (cons.)"
"First, the record refutes plaintiffs' assertion that defendants undertook a duty to protect people

on Navistar's premises from injury or death due to violent criminal attacks by third parties."
"""[U]nder

the voluntary undertaking doctrine of liability, the duty of care to be imposed upon the defendant is

limited to the extent of the undertaking."""
"Castro v. Brown's Chicken & Pasta, Inc., 314 Ill. App."
"3d

542, 547 (2000)."
"In cases that addressed whether the presence of security guards amounted to a

voluntary undertaking to protect tenants from criminal acts, the determinative factor was the purpose

for hiring the security guards."
"A duty was found if the hiring agreement showed that the security

guards were intended to protect the tenants, but no duty was found if the agreement showed that the

guards were intended to protect only property."
"Compare Pippin, 78 Ill. 2d at 207 (the security agency

assumed a duty to protect the decedent where the security agency contracted with the Chicago

Housing Authority to provide armed guards and other protective services for the purpose of guarding

property and protecting the people on the premises), with Hill v. Chicago Housing Authority, 233

Ill. App."
"3d 923, 930 (1992) (no duty to protect the plaintiff from the criminal act where affidavits

established that the Chicago Housing Authority hired the security agency to protect only property)."
"Here, the contract specifically stated that Vance did not guarantee the personal safety of any

person and had no liability arising from the criminal acts of any third parties."
"Moreover, the

contract, post orders, and conduct of Navistar and defendants established that the extent of

defendants' undertaking was limited to providing unarmed security officers who would maintain a

presence, observe and report in order to deter loss from fire, theft, sabotage, vandalism, or horseplay."
"Vance never promised orally or in writing to supply the guards or guardhouses with emergency

communication equipment."
"Furthermore, Vance had no role with respect to the placement and

                                                    9

"design of the guardhouses, or the video monitoring or building keycard access systems at Navistar's

facility."
"Vance's security officers were required to patrol Navistar's property and monitor employees

and visitors, vehicle traffic, and inbound or outbound freight."
"The security officers were required

to observe the condition of various buildings and equipment, and report any irregularities to Navistar."
"While at the gate guardhouse, the security officers were required to observe employees or visitors

and not allow them to bring in harmful items."
"Furthermore, the security officers had to ensure that

people entering the plant had the proper identification to permit ingress."
"If any visitors without

passes or discharged employees wanted to enter the premises, the security officers had to direct them

to the loss prevention trailer at another entrance point."
"Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, Vance's

undertaking of that responsibility did not create by implication a broader duty to protect Navistar's

employees from criminal attacks."
"See Phillips v. Budget Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc., 372 Ill. App."
"3d 155, 163-65 (2007) (a security agency that undertook a contractual obligation to prevent vehicles

from leaving a rental car facility without proper authorization did not owe a duty to protect the

plaintiff from injuries sustained when a stolen rental vehicle collided with her car during a high-

speed police chase)."
"See also Frye v. Medicare-Glaser Corp., 153 Ill. 2d 26, 32-34 (1992) (the court

rejected the plaintiff's ""overly broad interpretation of the defendants' undertaking"" and found that the

defendant pharmacy and pharmacist did not assume a duty to warn the decedent of all possible

dangers and side effects of a medication by voluntarily placing a drowsiness warning on the

prescription)."
"Second, the record also refutes plaintiffs' assertion that defendants' negligent performance

of its contractual duties increased the risk of harm to plaintiffs."
"The post orders did not require the

                                                  10
1-06-2009 & 1-06-2126 (cons.)"
security officers to keep the gate guardhouse doors locked.
"Such a requirement would have been

impractical because the security officers had to continuously exit the gate guardhouse to inspect

vehicles entering and exiting the premises."
"Moreover, security officers had to greet visitors and

direct them to the appropriate entrance if they lacked visitors' passes."
"Furthermore, any private

deliveries for Navistar employees required the security officers to greet the delivery people, collect

their information, and summon the appropriate Navistar employee to receive the delivery."
"The record reflects that, on the date in question, Diamond complied with the post orders and

performed her job duties with reasonable care."
"The unlocked gate guardhouse door was

inconsequential where Baker used the ruse of a private delivery to a Navistar employee to approach

and distract Diamond and then surprise her with a gun."
"Third, plaintiffs offer no evidence to support their assertion that they relied on defendants ""to

secure the facility and exclude feared intruders."""
"The record establishes that there was no history of

any workplace violence at Navistar prior to Baker's criminal conduct in 2001."
"Until this 2001

shooting rampage, Baker did not pose a known threat where he had not harassed or threatened

anyone at Navistar before or since his 1995 termination."
"The trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants because they had

no duty to protect plaintiffs from third-party criminal acts."
"Because we find that defendants did not

owe that duty to plaintiffs, we do not reach the parties' proximate cause or intervening, superceding

cause arguments."
"CONCLUSION

       The trial court's order entering summary judgment in favor of defendants is affirmed."
Affirmed.

While under arrest and awaiting execution by King Theodoric for threatening his position by attempting to reconcile a schism between Rome and Constantinople in 524, Boethius wrote his best know work, The Consolation of Philosophy, in which he argues that despite the seeming injustice of the world, there is, in Platonic fashion, a higher realm and that all else is subordinate to that divine Providence."

Edition: current; Page: [vi]Edition: current; Page: [vii]

PREFACE

The preparations for adequately commemorating the forthcoming millenary of King Alfred’s death have set going a fresh wave of popular interest in that hero."
"Lectures have been given, committees formed, subscriptions paid and promised, and an excellent book of essays by eminent specialists has been written about Alfred considered under quite a number of aspects."
"That great King has himself told us that he was not indifferent to the opinion of those that should come after him, and he earnestly desired that that opinion should be a high one."
"We have by no means forgotten him, it is true, but yet to very many intelligent people he is, to use a paradox, a distinctly nebulous character of history."
His most undying attributes in the memory of the people are not unconnected with singed cakes and romantic visits in disguise to the Edition: current; Page: [viii]Danish camp.
"It is therefore difficult for many to realize that Alfred wrote books, copies of which, written during his lifetime, are now lying in some of our great libraries."
"Of these books all are interesting to us from the personal character impressed on them by the King—the Pastoral Care, for instance, for its admirable preface containing Alfred’s observations on the state of learning in the England of his day, and the Orosius for the valuable geographical contributions which he inserted in his version of the once famous historian."
But there is one of his books that more than the others is instinct with a certain anonymously personal note such as we look for in vain in English literature for hundreds of years after.
"This book is his version of the Consolations of Philosophy of Boethius, the making of which was to Alfred a love’s labour."
"It satisfied his intellectual cravings and stimulated his uncultured but vigorous mind, and he resolved to give his still more unlettered lieges a share in the treat."
"So he turned it into his own tongue, as the King of the West Saxons might be expected to do, in a large and royal way, scattering up and down the work such notes and comments as he judged needful."
His Boethius heads the roll of English philosophical writings; it likewise heads the roll of English translations.
"Edition: current; Page: [ix]It is hoped that the modern English dress here given to the King’s best book will help to make him less an unsubstantial shadow for Englishmen of to-day, and more a real man, practical, right-feeling, and earnest beyond his generation."
A few words on the method and aim of this modern version may be said here rather than in the Introduction.
The Anglo-Saxon text followed is that edited by the translator for the Oxford University Press last year.
"The prose part is rendered quite literally, generally ‘word by word,’ as the King says of parts of his own version."
Thus the simplicity and directness of the original Old English are kept.
"In the version of the alliterating verses, printed together after the prose, the metre of the original Old English has been retained as far as is allowed by the limitations of modern English, but literalness has not been thereby sacrificed."
"The result, I may hope, will give a fair idea of the original, which itself is far from echoing the hammer-and-anvil lines of the best Old English song-smiths, as we see them at work in the Beowulf."
"The Introduction is intended to give the general reader what he may like to know about Alfred’s Boethius and his literary method in general, and the student of English literature will perhaps find interest Edition: current; Page: [x]in the selections from later English translations of the Consolations."
"It is now time for me to close this preface, first expressing my heartiest thanks to Professor York Powell, who has kindly looked carefully through the proofs of the Introduction and portions of both the prose and the verse, and has helped me generally out of his mature experience."

INTRODUCTION

§ 1."
Wessex at Peace.
Alfred’s Reforms.
"In the year 878 a.d., on the conclusion of the negotiations begun with Guthrum at Wedmore, Wessex emerged unbeaten but sorely shaken from a life-struggle that had lasted many years without intermission."
"Inch by inch the Scandinavian pirates had been driven back, and now the West-Saxon king could boast of a broader realm than ever before had been his, and better still, a more united people."
"The first seven or eight years of his reign had been spent in camp or on the march, fighting, pursuing, retreating, in the varying fortunes of the struggle; a busy time, with small leisure for thoughts or deeds unconnected with immediate and constant peril."
"Alfred’s early ambitions had perforce to sleep, while his people had enough to do to hold their ground against the invader, standing still or going back on the path of culture."
"Still, it is probable that the harsh training king and subjects had gone through together in their dark days was after all a real though disguised benefit to both."
"They shared the memory of perils and hardships borne together, and must have come to understand and sympathize with each other as only those can do that have side by side faced Edition: current; Page: [xii]a common danger for many months."
"And so Alfred would, when brighter days came, find ready to his hand ‘fitting instruments of rule,’ as he himself calls them."
"He entered upon the herculean labour of building up and consolidating the shattered fabric of society and government with a deep sense of the responsibility involved, and a clear perception of the difficulties to be faced."
"But his keen enthusiasm for the work made it seem easy, and carried him through it all with admirable success."
"Everything had to be done, as a veritable chasm gaped between the present and the past."
"First of all, the laws of the West-Saxon kings had to be copied afresh, amended, and published, and their honest administration enforced, so that equal justice done between man and man might smooth the way for the arts of peace."
"The citizen army had to be organized against a possible recrudescence of the piratical raids, a fleet of ships had to be built, and London resettled and fortified."
"Agriculture could now be carried on in security, and the simple arts and manufactures of that day needed careful fostering."
"The Church, sorely weakened and humiliated after repeated outrage on the part of the heathen and by neglect of her own distracted people, must be raised to her former high estate."
"Her bishops and priests must be put back in their cures, her monasteries endowed, and piety and learning again cherished."
§ 2.
His Zeal for Learning.
"For of all the many forms of activity into which Alfred plunged in his eagerness to make up for lost time, we are sure that, next to religion, the cause of Edition: current; Page: [xiii]learning lay nearest his heart."
"He himself had always loved it, its books and its bookmen, and he wanted his people to share his love."
"He quite understood that before a nation can begin to advance along the road of enlightenment and civilization it must be taught the elements of education; and we know from his own account into what a lamentable ignorance, not only the common people, but even the clergy had fallen."
"The words of the King on this subject are most instructive, and for the history of his times of prime authority."
"‘The sacred orders,’ he says, ‘were once zealous in teaching and study."
.
.
.
"Men used to come to England from other lands in search of wisdom and instruction, but now we should be obliged to get them from abroad if we wanted them."
"So entirely was learning fallen away in England that there were very few on this side of the Humber who could understand their church services in English, or even turn a Latin letter into English; and I think there were not many beyond the Humber."
"There were so few of them that I cannot call to mind a single one south of the Thames, when I succeeded to the throne."
.
.
.
"Thinking over all this, I remembered also how I had seen, before the country was all ravaged and burnt, the churches throughout England standing full of treasures and books."
"There was also a great number of God’s ministers, but they had very little profit of their books, of which, not being written in their own tongue, they could make nothing.’

One of Alfred’s first acts in furtherance of his educational schemes was, if we may believe the story in Asser’s Life, the foundation of a court school, wherein he followed, consciously or not, the example of the Edition: current; Page: [xiv]great Frankish king whom he resembled in so many ways."
"It is interesting to note that Charlemagne had, like Alfred, much trouble in interesting his rough war-like nobles in his schemes for the spread of education."
"As stated by himself, Alfred’s plan was that ‘all the sons of English free men, who could afford the time, should be kept at their studies, while they were as yet of no use to the state, until they could read English with ease."
"Then those who were to continue their education and to be promoted to a higher order should be taught Latin.’

Alfred, again like Charlemagne, had the good sense to gather round him the best scholars he could find, sending to other lands for them, as his own produced them no longer."
"The names of the little group of learned clerics that helped the King to such good purpose were—the two Mercians, Werfrith or Waerferth, Bishop of Worcester, and Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury; Grimbold, a Frankish priest, afterwards Abbot of Winchester; John, a priest from Old Saxony; and Asser, a Welsh monk."
"All of these, except the last, are mentioned by the King in the preface to his translation of the Pastoral Care of Pope Gregory."
"With the co-operation of these scholars, then, Alfred took in hand the education of his people."
"Though hungry for knowledge, it is probable that he was at a disadvantage in his equipment for its pursuit."
"He doubtless had an education suitable to a king’s son when he was at Rome, and afterwards in England, but he assumed the reins of government at so early an age, and was so entirely absorbed in fighting the Northmen during the first years of his reign, that he cannot have had Edition: current; Page: [xv]much leisure for keeping up or adding to his learning."
"Hence he could not fully understand unaided the more difficult books written in Latin, the sole language of the learned in Western Europe in his day."
"In the Life of Alfred, ascribed to Asser, we are told that one of his learned men used daily to read aloud to the King passages from his favourite authors."
"William of Malmesbury, too, a later chronicler, who made use of early annals and other old sources, mentions how Asser used to explain to Alfred the harder passages met with in reading the Latin text of the De Consolatione Philosophiae of Boethius."
"Being aware that the knowledge of Latin was wellnigh extinct among the clergy of his kingdom, and that to the common folk every avenue to learning was barred, Alfred conceived, and about the year 886 began to carry out, a plan of translating into English certain well-known standard works which he judged best fitted to give in moderate compass a good plain fund of knowledge to the Englishman of his day."
"These works, to use the King’s words, were ‘such books as are the most needful for all men to know.’ The modern reader should remember that a man who had mastered ten Latin books in the ninth century in England would have been accounted well read, and a knowledge of the contents of fifty would have amounted to encyclopaedic learning."
"Alfred’s choice fell upon the following works:—

1."
"The Universal History of Orosius, written early in the fifth century, being a compendium of the history of the world, written from a Christian point of view."
2.
"The History of the English Church by the Venerable Bede, containing the history of the English Edition: current; Page: [xvi]from their conquest of Britain up to the end of the seventh century, chiefly ecclesiastical, enlivened with accounts of saints and miraculous occurrences."
3.
"The Dialogues of Pope Gregory the Great, a popular book, describing the lives and miracles of Italian saints, and treating of the life of the soul after death."
4.
"The Pastoral Care or Rule of the same Gregory, a practical manual of the duties of the clergy."
5.
The De Consolatione Philosophiae of Boethius.
6.
The Soliloquies of St. Augustine.
"Of these books the History of Orosius, the Consolation of Philosophy, the Pastoral Care, and the Soliloquies were put into English by the King himself."
"The Dialogues of Gregory were perhaps translated by Bishop Werfrith at Alfred’s suggestion, and it is probable that the English version of Bede’s Ecclesiastical History in its original form was also the work of one of the King’s learned priests."
§ 3.
The De Consolatione Philosophiae of Boethius.
By far the most important of these works was the famous treatise of Boethius.
"It was the philosophical vade-mecum of the Middle Ages, and countless scholars during a thousand years knew little else of abstract reasoning save what they found in its pages."
"The influence that it exercised on the expression of abstract thinking during many centuries is hardly conceivable by us moderns, who can range freely over the best of ancient classical literature and wield a philosophical vocabulary ready made for us."
"Its influence and popularity, indeed, as a book of practical piety, can only be Edition: current; Page: [xvii]compared with that of the later Imitation of Christ, and the earlier Cicero’s De Officiis."
"Hundreds of manuscripts of it are still to be found in dozens of libraries, some of them going back to the tenth century; and it was one of the first books printed in Europe."
"Wherever the rude tongues of mediaeval Europe began to be articulate in prose, versions of the De Consolatione Philosophiae in the vernacular appeared."
"Of these early translations Alfred’s was the first, and it was followed after the lapse of about a hundred years by a literal rendering into the Alemannic dialect of the Old High German language made at the famous monastery of St. Gall by the monk Notker."
To the eleventh century belongs a fragment of a manuscript now in the Public Library of Orleans containing part of a free rendering or imitation in old Provençal.
"In the course of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries there appeared four versions in French, the first by the famous Jehan de Meun, who dedicated it to Philippe le Bel."
In England no less a poet than Geoffrey Chaucer made a prose translation.
"He was followed by nearly a dozen others in the following centuries, including Queen Elizabeth, and the last English version was published as late as the year 1897."
"We have said nothing, be it noted, of Italian, Spanish, and Greek versions, all of which had begun to appear before the end of the fifteenth century."
Other tongues have also done their share in popularizing the Consolations.
"It has frequently been annotated and imitated, and it has comforted hundreds in their day of affliction."
"Our own Sir Thomas More had it with him in prison, and even wrote an imitation of it."
"Leslie, Edition: current; Page: [xviii]Bishop of Ross, sent an imitation of it to his royal and captive mistress in 1572."
Its influence on European literature has been immense.
Traces have been found in the ancient English poem of Beowulf.
Chaucer’s poems are steeped in it.
"Gower, Lydgate, and Spenser drank inspiration at this fountain, as the author of the Roman de la Rose in France, and the greater Dante and Boccaccio in Italy had done in their day."
"The sad surroundings under which the Consolation of Philosophy was written have ever found a responsive chord of sympathy in the hearts of the oppressed, and never more readily than in those turbulent times when the great ones of the earth were liable to be reft in a day of rank and honours at the nod of a capricious tyrant."
§ 4.
Boethius and his Fate.
"Let us now glance at the life of the author of this classic of the Middle Ages, the man whom Gibbon styles ‘the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman.’

About 400 years before King Alfred wrote, Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, starting from Wallachia, led a host of his folk over the Alps, and overthrowing Odovacar (Odoacer) reigned over Italy in his stead."
"Theodoric’s rule for many years was just and impartial, neither unduly oppressing the orthodox nor favouring those of the Arian heresy to which he himself belonged."
"He also respected the Imperial traditions, so that the Roman Senate continued to exercise at least a show of its old functions."
"Among the eminent Romans of the time one was marked out for high honour by the new ruler on account Edition: current; Page: [xix]of his high descent, vast wealth, and remarkable ability."
"Amicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, who was born about 480 a.d., traced his origin to families powerful even under the Republic."
"His wife Rusticiana was a daughter of Symmachus, a nobleman of great connexions and estate."
"Boethius rose from one honour to another, being Consul in 510, and again in 522 in conjunction with his two young sons; and at length he came to be Head of the Senate, the most dignified position to which a Roman subject could attain."
"Contemporary historians tell us in what repute Boethius was held by all right-thinking men as well as by Theodoric, and how he laboured to lay bare the corruption and misgovernment of the Roman officials."
"His enemies were consequently numerous, and they plotted his downfall."
"After years of beneficent rule, Theodoric suddenly developed signs of intolerance."
"He sent Pope John the First on a humiliating embassy to Justin the Emperor of the East at Constantinople, and on his return cast him into prison, where the old and feeble pontiff soon died."
Theodoric was now in the mood to listen to charges made by the foes of Boethius.
"Accused of being concerned in a conspiracy against his imperial master, the noble Roman defended himself with the eloquence for which he was famed, but in vain."
"He was sentenced by the Senate to imprisonment, Theodoric still wishing to keep up an appearance of legality, and was confined in a dungeon at Ticinum."
"There, when his property had been confiscated, and after many months of imprisonment, he was, as we are told, tortured and put to death."
"Edition: current; Page: [xx]

Those of his contemporaries whose writings have reached us, such as Priscian, Cassiodorus, and Ennodius, regarded Boethius as decidedly the most able and learned man of his day."
"He was deeply versed in the works of the Greek philosophers, some of which he turned into Latin and annotated for the use of his countrymen."
It is certain that for centuries after his death the mediaeval schoolmen knew Aristotle almost solely through the translations and commentaries of Boethius.
"He had also a remarkable talent for mathematics, science, and practical engineering, and his work on music remained till last century the chief text-book on the subject at Oxford and Cambridge."
"After his death Boethius came to be regarded by the Church of Rome as a martyr for the orthodox faith, and was canonized as St. Severinus."
"Many works on doctrinal theology have been attributed to him, but modern scholars are not agreed as to his authorship of them, nor even as to his having been a Christian at all."
"His most important and authentic work, the De Consolatione Philosophiae, contains nothing from which the Christianity of its author could be positively inferred, for it bases its philosophy entirely on the old systems of Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Neo-Platonists."
§ 5.
Alfred’s Method of Translation.
Such was the man who wrote the famous book which King Alfred set himself to make known to his people.
That it was a task after the English monarch’s own heart we may well believe.
"The splendid career and the wretched end of the last great Roman must have Edition: current; Page: [xxi]deeply impressed Alfred, who had himself known adversity, and was far from sure that his present heyday would last."
"But the task of translation, though congenial, was difficult."
"In the first place, Alfred’s knowledge of Latin can hardly have sufficed to give him an exact idea of the contents of a book whose style was modelled on the old classical writers of Rome, and differed widely from the crude Latin written by the learned monks in the ninth century."
"This difficulty the King surmounted, as we have already noticed, by having Asser read out the Latin text and explain it to him; and this is confirmed by an examination of Alfred’s version, which in many parts bears the marks of having been written from a recent recollection of the Latin rather than directly from it."
"The King’s version makes no attempt to imitate the artificial and involved periods of Boethius; he was content to write so as to be ‘understanded of the people,’ and in this he succeeded, for his English, though devoid of art and often inelegant and rambling, is clear enough as to the sense."
"It is probable that Alfred wrote as he spoke, for he could have found but little prose literature in English fit to form his style upon."
"Certain parts of the Vulgate and the Book of Psalms and a number of prayers had been Englished, as the Life informs us; but beyond these it is likely that no prose of a literary character existed in West-Saxon."
"All previous literary effort in English had taken the form of verse, which chiefly flourished north of the Humber; and we have the curious, but not isolated, spectacle of a noble and expressive poetry co-existing with a rude, faltering, barely Edition: current; Page: [xxii]articulate prose, as we can see it in the old charters which have come down to us."
In the process of transferring the ideas of Boethius into English of the ninth century a certain loss was inevitable.
"This Alfred doubtless realized, and from the first resolved to attempt no more than to give the general sense of his original, now keeping fairly close to the Latin, now being content to find a simple expression for ‘dark words’; here omitting what he judged of less moment for the end he had in view, there making additions of his own."
And it is just these additions that are the most interesting part of the King’s version.
"In them we see him in the capacity of author, and can make a comparison between the ideals he himself here puts before us and his success in realizing them as recorded in the pages of history."
"In this connexion we may note that the annals of the West Saxons, perhaps previously written in Latin, were in the latter years of Alfred’s rule recorded in English, probably by the King’s orders, and the events of his reign were described in language of considerable vigour, with which it is instructive to compare the prose of the royal writer himself."
"These annals form the first instalment of the famous Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was continued in various monasteries, till the last version, the Peterborough Book, ends with the joyful accession of Henry II."
Thus King Alfred may be regarded as the first known writer of English literary prose.
"Abbot Ælfric, about a century after, recognized his debt to the King, saying that in his day ‘there were no other godly books in the English tongue save the books that King Edition: current; Page: [xxiii]Alfred skilfully translated from Latin into English.’ Ælfric formed himself consciously on the style of the King, and in his hands English prose became smoother and clearer, more elegant, and more suited to the expression of shades of thought."
It is now time to see how the English King went to work in turning the Consolations of Philosophy into his own tongue.
A glance over his version will at once show that it is very far from being even a free translation of the original work.
"Alfred evidently realized that a literal rendering, such as we find in his version of the Pastoral Care, would be a difficult task for himself, and would be largely unintelligible to the people for whom it was intended."
"So he resolved to omit what seemed to him unessential, or too hard to translate, or too stiff for plain men’s comprehension, and he did not hesitate to amplify where he thought a fuller treatment needed."
"Thus at the very beginning of the work he supplies a historical Introduction, and boldly transposes and condenses the first few sections of the Latin; a treatment to which he occasionally resorts throughout the book, particularly at the end."
One is soon struck in reading Alfred’s version by the large number of explanatory notes inserted in the text.
"The King watches his chance, and explains allusions, mythological, historical, and geographical, with evident pleasure, and sometimes at great length."
"This plan was also followed by Alfred in his Orosius, and here we see his anxiety that obscurities should be removed, so that his book might be truly a popular one, and read by persons who had no knowledge of the ages that lay behind them, and to whom a literal Edition: current; Page: [xxiv]translation of the De Consolatione would often have seemed mere nonsense."
"It has been proved that Alfred made considerable use of Latin commentaries which had already appeared before his day, just as they had appeared in the case of the old classical writers, and many of the additions that distinguish Alfred’s version, and till quite recently were unhesitatingly credited to him, are now seen to correspond, often word for word, with commentaries still extant in MSS."
dating from the tenth and eleventh centuries1.
"This, however, only shows that Alfred procured the best MSS."
"of the Consolation that he could, and used the commentaries written in the margin, just as modern scholars make use of the scholia in preparing their editions of the classical texts."
"From a modern reader’s point of view these constant digressions seem to encumber the text and impede the free course of the argument, but we should remember that in Alfred’s day such things as footnotes were unknown, so that he was obliged to put everything into the text, unless he had chosen to imitate the scholia or explanatory notes written on the broad margins of the Latin manuscripts."
"Alfred’s arrangement, however, was exactly adapted to the purpose he had in view, for as books were in those days generally read aloud by one man in the presence of others, it was convenient that his reading should flow on without interruption from distracting notes."
Another point in which Alfred’s version differs from the original is its distinctly Christian colouring.
"As we have said before, Boethius Edition: current; Page: [xxv]gives no sign in his Consolations of Philosophy that he was acquainted with or influenced by the Christian faith."
"Alfred, on the contrary, mentions Christ by name, speaks of ‘Christian men,’ ‘angels,’ ‘the devil’; and the name of God, which the Roman seldom directly mentions, occurs nearly two hundred times in the English version."
"Alfred’s allusions to Old Testament history form an entirely new feature, while as a Western Churchman he shows his disapproval of the Arian Theodoric as markedly as he shows his sympathy with the Catholic Boethius."
"Frequently Alfred forgets his rôle of translator, and prompted by a word or phrase of his original, writes freely as his own feelings taught him."
"One of these spontaneous outpourings has a keen and enduring interest for Englishmen; revealing as it does the noble aims of him whom the late Professor Freeman called ‘the most perfect character in history.’ This is the passage on the duties of a king forming chapter xvii, where Alfred sets forth his aims in stirring words that deserve a place on every monument that Englishmen may raise to their national hero."
"‘It has ever been my desire,’ he says, ‘to live honourably while I was alive, and after my death to leave to them that should come after me my memory in good works.’

§ 6."
Manuscripts of the Old English Boethius.
"King Alfred’s Boethius has reached us in two manuscripts, one of the tenth century written about fifty or sixty years after his death, and the other dating from the beginning of the twelfth century."
"The older Edition: current; Page: [xxvi]manuscript is now in the British Museum, having once formed part of the collection made by Sir Henry Cotton in the seventeenth century."
"It was injured by the fire which ravaged this valuable collection in the year 1740, and for a century afterwards lay neglected in a box."
"Some sixty years ago two scholars arranged the scattered and charred leaves, and with great skill mounted them separately in an album, like photographs, so that now the greater part of the writing on the damaged vellum can be made out in a favourable light."
"Towards the end of the seventeenth century, when this manuscript was still perfect, Franciscus Junius, a German scholar settled in England, the first serious and critical student of the oldest English, took from it many readings and wrote them in the margin of the copy he had made of the later manuscript, copy and manuscript being now in the Bodleian Library."
This manuscript is in perfect preservation.
Junius also copied from the Cotton or older manuscript the whole of the alliterating version of the metres of Boethius which in the later manuscript are rendered in Old English prose.
"Besides these two manuscripts, a small fragment of a third was discovered at the Bodleian Library at Oxford by Professor Napier some years ago."
"It is extremely probable that such a popular book as King Alfred’s Boethius would have been frequently copied, so that it is somewhat strange that more manuscripts of it have not come down to us."
"We are told that among the books presented by Bishop Leofric to the chapter of Exeter Cathedral in the eleventh century there was an old English version of the De Consolatione, referred to as Boeties boc on englisc, ‘The Book of Edition: current; Page: [xxvii]Boethius in English.’ The two manuscripts above mentioned differ in the following respects as to their contents."
"The older one has, as we have before said, a metrical alliterating version of the carmina of Boethius, which in the later one are rendered into prose."
"Again, while the text of the later manuscript is broken up into forty-two chapters that do not always correspond to the divisions in the Latin original, the older manuscript has no formal divisions, except that the end of each book and the beginning of the next are indicated."
"Both manuscripts had the same prose preface, but the older manuscript contains in addition a metrical proem which is wanting in the later one."
"Finally, the latter has a table of contents prefixed."
§ 7.
The Two Versions of the Lays of Boethius.
Alfred’s prose rendering of the verses of the original is often closer than that of the rest of the book.
"Some he omits altogether, especially towards the end, and one he amplifies to an immense extent (pp."
87-91).
An interesting question arises regarding the authorship of the version of the carmina which we find in the earlier manuscript.
"This is in verses of the usual Old English type, each line of which consists of two half-lines separated by a pause, with one or two stressed words in the first half-line alliterating with the first stressed word in the second, as in the line:—

Setton suðweardes ."
"sigeðeoda twa,

or, as we may render it:—

Two tribes victorious ."
tramped to the south.
Did King Alfred write this alliterating version as Edition: current; Page: [xxviii]well as the prose one which occurs in the later manuscript?
In seeking an answer to this question we will first turn to the prose preface prefixed to the work in both manuscripts (see p. 9).
"Here we find it stated that after King Alfred ‘had translated this book into English prose, he afterwards turned it into verse, as it is now done.’ This seems plain enough, and if we believe Alfred wrote this preface—and we have no prima facie reason to doubt it—the question is settled."
The metrical preface found in the older manuscript confirms the statement as to Alfred’s authorship.
"But not a few scholars, after a careful comparison of the two versions of the carmina, have persuaded themselves that the King could not have been the author of the metrical version, and are consequently forced to deny him the authorship of the prefaces."
"What we know for certain on this question does not amount to much, and may be thus summarized."
"Let us in the first place for convenience indicate by the letter B the prose version of the metres of Boethius which is found only in the Bodleian or later manuscript of Alfred’s translation, and by the letter C the alliterating metrical version of the same metres which only occurs in the Cotton or older manuscript."
1.
"A careful comparison between the two versions clearly shows us that C was made by a person who had B before him, the former being only an expansion in metrical form of the latter."
2.
It is equally certain that the Latin original was not used in the making of C. Thus we see that B represents the older version made by King Alfred.
"Edition: current; Page: [xxix]

3."
"Another thing to notice is that not all the metra of B have been turned into verse in C; and the omitted ones are not introduced and dismissed with the customary words ‘Then Philosophy began to sing,’ or ‘When Philosophy had sung this song.’

4."
Only a few lines in C contain new thoughts.
Of these additions the chief is the simile where the earth is compared to an egg (metr.
xx.
ll.
"169-175), and this was derived from a Latin commentary."
"Now, putting aside the Prefaces, the opponents of the King’s authorship of C base their case on two considerations, one being the third of the abovementioned facts."
"(a) The King, they say, would not have omitted any metra when turning B into C. (b) Further, they object that C is but a weak diluted version of the terse and often vigorous prose of B, and more likely to have been the work of some clerical versifier than of the King himself, who shows vigour and character in his literary work, and who would have added to and improved on B if he had resolved to recast it in a metrical form."
"To the first of these two arguments it may be replied that as the Latin original was laid aside, and B only was used in the preparation of C, Alfred might have easily overlooked some of the metra which were not preceded nor followed by the usual formulas; or again, he might have purposely omitted them for some reason or other."
"The second argument takes it for granted that Alfred must have been a good poet as well as a good king; and further, it puts C in a false light."
"We have to bear in mind that in the days of King Alfred, poetry, if ever it had been cultivated in the Edition: current; Page: [xxx]south of England as a branch of literature, had greatly declined in form and substance from the splendour to which it had attained in the preceding century in Northumbria."
"The modern critic is too apt to compare C with this older poetry, much to the disadvantage of the former; whereas we should remember that C was most probably meant to be read aloud or chanted."
"Thus then the seemingly idle expansions and repetitions which we find in it, and the occurrence of words and phrases consecrated to the use of poetry, would have greatly added to its effect, and made it more acceptable to the illiterate but unspoiled West-Saxons, to whose ears the folk-songs were quite familiar."
This is only an illustration of the fondness that all primitive races have for a regular chanted measure accompanied by a well-marked rhythm.
"Further, we learn from the Life attributed to Asser that Alfred loved the poetry of his native land, and learned much of it as a child, and we may well believe that he would welcome the chance of himself adding to the national store of verse."
Nor should we forget that he has given us some specimens of his verses in the Preface to his Pastoral Care.
"To sum up then, there seems no reason to doubt the tradition of antiquity and the testimony of the prefaces, even if these were not written by the King, that it was Alfred who turned the prose of B into the verse of C. We may imagine that, having completed the prose version of the De Consolatione, he felt that by versifying the metra he should be only doing the right thing by his author, and at the same time giving the lays of Boethius a form that would readily lend itself to learning by heart and recitation."
There would be no necessity for bringing Edition: current; Page: [xxxi]new thoughts into the verses.
"He had shown plenty of originality already in his prose version of Boethius, far more than in any of his other translations; and, besides, a fresh handling of the subject would probably have taken more time than he could spare in his busy life."
His end then would be fully attained if he produced a rough metrical version with the familiar alliteration and swing of the national poetry; and in this he succeeded very fairly.
"His subjects may well have preferred the more long-winded verses, with their familiar poetical catchwords and reminiscences of the older poetry, to the more severe and colourless prose of his earlier version."
§ 8.
"A list of Alfred’s notable comments and additions may be here given:

§ 9."
"Later English Versions of the ‘Consolations.’

We will now place before the reader in chronological order specimens of the English versions of the Consolation of Philosophy that have been made since Alfred’s time."
Taken together they give a fair idea of the course of English translation during the last five Edition: current; Page: [xxxiii]hundred years.
"The same passages, both from the prose and the verse, will be given where possible."
"Not a single attempt was made, so far as is known, to follow the great King’s example, until nearly five centuries after he wrote his Boethius."
The task would have been perhaps too heavy for the English language and for English learning.
During these centuries our speech had been as it were in the melting-pot.
"The old standard West-Saxon, in the political and social ferment that had followed the Norman Conquest, had given place to various provincial dialects as literary media."
"These in their turn had begun to merge in another standard form, rivalling in vigour and adaptability the Norman stocks from which it took many a graft."
"This standard English, which at length emerged from the competition of dialects, to last with comparatively slight change to the present day, was largely indebted to the labours of our first great modern poet."
"Geoffrey Chaucer in the beginning of his literary career devoted much of his time to translation, and felt himself obliged, in the course of his work, to transplant hundreds of Norman-French words into his own tongue."
By this means he made English a more complete instrument than he found it; and in his literal translation of the Consolation of Philosophy he laid the foundations of an English philosophical prose.
"This version, all in prose, swarming with new words, the greater number of which are still in use, is of uncommon interest, as it is the first prose work of the master, and the source of the many allusions to and quotations from Boethius which run through his original poems."
A peculiarity of Chaucer’s Boèce lies in the inclusion of Edition: current; Page: [xxxiv]glosses or explanatory notes in the text.
"They are usually introduced by the words ‘That is to say,’ and most of them were derived from the Latin manuscript which Chaucer had before him."
"Rather more than a generation after Chaucer wrote his Boëce, a metrical version of the De Consolatione was made by one ‘Johannes Capellanus,’ as he is called in the manuscript copies still extant in the British Museum and other libraries."
"The real name of the translator is, in the Christ Church MS. at Oxford, given as John Walton, Canon of Osney [Oxford], afterwards Sub-dean of York."
He is said to have translated the De Consolatione in 1410 at the request of Dame Elizabeth Berkeley.
"His version was printed for the first and only time in 1525, in The Boke of Comfort at the monastery of Tavistock."
"The first three books are in eight-line stanzas of the type ababbcbc, and the last two in seven-lined Edition: current; Page: [xxxvi]stanzas, Chaucer’s ‘rhyme royal.’ A preface and a historical introduction in verse are prefixed to the whole work, and there is another short proem to the fourth and fifth books."
"The following lines from the first proem are interesting:—

I haue herd spek & sumwhat haue iseyne

In metir sum, & sum in prose pleyne,

The first great English king had thought the translation of Boethius’ work a labour well worth the doing; it now remained for the first great English queen to follow his example.
"Queen Elizabeth, amid the countless preoccupations of her high estate, found time to translate the Consolations of Philosophy at Windsor, and several other Latin works, in the year 1593."
"The manuscript in which the royal version is preserved in the Record Office is partly in the Queen’s handwriting, the rest being written by a scribe to whom she dictated."
"In this MS. several persons bear witness that the Queen finished the work in an extraordinarily short space of time, twenty-five to twenty-seven hours of actual work, spread over a month, taking out Sundays, holidays, and absences from Windsor; the rate of work being one and a half to two hours a day."
There may be some courtier’s exaggeration about this.
"The translation is fairly accurate and very literal, and the Queen’s spelling is remarkably untrammelled, as may be seen from the first specimen, which is written in her own handwriting in the MS.1

And with his blood allays his thirst."

SUMMARY OF CONTENTS

BOOK I
Chapters I-VI

First comes the Historical Introduction (chap i)."
"While Boethius is lying in the dungeon lamenting his hard lot and vanished happiness, there appears to him divine Philosophy, the spirit of Wisdom, who raises him up and bids him look on her."
He then recognizes in her his old teacher whom he had known in his happier days.
"She proceeds to show him that his misfortune arises from his neglect of her precepts, and his trust in the promises of fickle Fortune; and she undertakes to cure him of his melancholy."
BOOK II.
"Chapters VII-XXI

Philosophy tells Boethius that what he once accounted happiness was not really such; that he is not the first to suffer a reverse of fortune; that worldly joys are deceitful."
"Fortune changes, and men must also change with her."
Boethius owes his misfortune to his desire for worldly happiness.
"In reply, Boethius confesses his wrong and is in despair."
"Philosophy then points out that he is not really unhappy, for his sorrows will pass away as his riches have done."
"He has many blessings left—his noble father-in-law Symmachus, his wife, and his two sons Let him seek happiness within himself, not outside; for he does wrong to set his heart on inferior creatures, over which he has no right of possession."
"God wishes man to rule all other creatures, but man makes himself their slave."
"Riches bring enemies; and power, often coming to very bad men, is not in its nature Edition: current; Page: [liv]good."
"As for fame, even if it be worldwide it has but a narrow range, this earth being a mere speck in the universe When Fortune turns her back on a man she does him a real service, in enabling him to find the way to goodness."
BOOK III.
"Chapters XXII-XXXV

Boethius admits that he is greatly comforted by the words of Philosophy, but he would like to hear more of her healing doctrine."
In what does true happiness consist?
"Thereupon Philosophy discusses the nature of the Supreme Good, and shows how all men, even the worst, long to reach it."
"This Good does not lie in power, nor in wealth, nor in fame, nor in high birth, nor in carnal pleasure; no, it lies in God; and therefore True Happiness lies in Him Men can participate in happiness, and thereby attain to divinity."
"Evil has no existence, for God, who can do all things, cannot do evil."
BOOK IV.
"Chapters XXXVI-XL

Boethius says he cannot quite cease to be unhappy until he knows why God suffers evil to exist, or why, suffering it, He does not punish evil-doers, instead of allowing them to flourish, while wisdom and other virtues go dishonoured."
"Philosophy replies that Boethius is mistaken, for the wicked have no real power, and never reach the Supreme Good, and moreover are punished."
Punishment is a real benefit to the wrong-doer.
Then the discussion leads to the subject of Fate and Providence.
"Providence is the supreme Reason that plans and orders all things; Fate is the instrument which links them together, and sets them in motion, under Providence."
"BOOK V.
Chapters XL to End."
Philosophy discusses the coexistence of divine foreknowledge and man’s free-will; and finally discourses on the nature of God.

King Alfred’s Version of the Consolations of Boethius

Edition: current; Page: [lvi]

PROEM

King Alfred was the interpreter of this book, and turned it from book Latin into English, as it is now done."
"Now he set forth word by word, now sense from sense, as clearly and intelligently as he was able, in the various and manifold worldly cares that oft troubled him both in mind and in body."
"These cares are very hard for us to reckon, that in his days came upon the kingdoms to which he had succeeded, and yet when he had studied this book and turned it from Latin into English prose, he wrought it up once more into verse, as it is now done."
"And now he prayeth and in God’s name beseecheth every man that careth to read this book, to pray for him, and not to blame him if he understand it more rightly than he (Alfred) could."
"For every man must, according to the measure of his understanding and leisure, speak what he speaketh and do what he doeth."

Boethius and Theodoric

I

Page 1IN THE days when the Goths out of the land of Scythia had raised war against the Roman empire, and under their kings Rædgod and Alaric had stormed Rome, and won all the realm of Italy from the mountains even to the island of Sicily, then, after those kings, did Theodoric hold the same empire in sway."
"Theodoric was an Amuling and a Christian, though he held fast to the Arian heresy."
"To the Romans he promised his friendship, and that they should keep their old rights; but he kept that promise very basely, and his end was grievous and full of sin, in that his countless crimes were increased by the murder of Pope John."
"At that time there lived a consul, a chief we should now call him, whose name was Boethius, a man of book-learning and in worldly life most truly wise."
"He, perceiving the manifold wrongs wrought by Theodoric upon the Christian faith and upon the chief men of the Romans, began to recall the glad times and immemorial rights they had onceEdition: current; Page: [2]enjoyed under the Caesars, their ancient lords."
"And so meditating, he began to muse and cast about within himself how he might wrest the sovereignty from the unrighteous king and restore it to them of the true faith and of righteous life."
"Wherefore, sending word privily to the Caesar at Constantinople, the chief city of the Greeks and the seat of their kings, because this Caesar was of the kin of the ancient lords of the Romans, he prayed him to help them back to their Christian faith and their old laws."
"But cruel King Theodoric heard of these designs, and straightway commanded that Boethius be thrust into a dungeon and kept fast therein."
"Now when this good man fell into so great straits he waxed sore of mind, by so much the more that he had once known happier days."
"In the prison he could find no comfort; falling down, grovelling on his face he lay sorrowing on the floor, in deep despair, and began to weep over himself, and to sing, and this was his song:

II

THE songs that I, poor exile, once sang so merrily I must now croon sadly sighing, and make of unmeet words."
"I who of old did oft so deftly weave them, now even the fitting words I fit awry, weeping aye and sobbing."
"’Tis faithless prosperity hath dimmed my sight, blinding me and forsaking me in this sunless cell, and that to which I ever trusted most hath robbed me of all my joy."
It hath turned its Edition: current; Page: [3]back upon me and utterly fled from me.
"Why, oh why, did my friends tell me I was a happy man?"
How can he be happy that cannot abide in happiness?
"III

P. 3."
"WHEN I had sung thus plaintively, saith Boethius, there entered unto me divine Philosophy, who, addressing words of greeting to my mournful mind, said, ‘Art thou not the man that was once nourished and taught in my school?"
Then how comes it that thou art thus grievously oppressed with these worldly sorrows?
"Unless, methinks, thou hast too soon forgotten the weapons that once I gave thee.’ Then, lifting up her voice, she cried, ‘Depart from the mind of my servant, ye worldly cares accursed, for ye are the worst of foes, and suffer him to return again to my teachings.’ And she drew nearer unto my grieving intelligence, saith Boethius, and raised it up somewhat from its prostrate state; then, drying its eyes, she asked it cheerily whether it knew again its foster-mother."
"With that the Mind turned towards her and forthwith clearly recognized his own mother, that same Philosophy that long before had trained and taught him."
"And perceiving that the mantle of her doctrine was much rent and torn by the hands of foolish men, he asked her how this came about."
"And Philosophy made answer and said that her disciples had torn her thus, being minded to possess Edition: current; Page: [4]her altogether."
But of a truth they will gather much folly by their presumption and vainglory unless every one of them shall turn again to her healing care.
P. 4.
"Here Philosophy began to take pity on the Mind’s feebleness, and fell to singing, and these were her words: ‘Ah, how deep the pit in which the mind labours when it is assailed by the hardships of this life!"
"If it forget its own light (that is, joy eternal), and press on to unfamiliar darkness (that is, the cares of this world), as this Mind now doth, naught else shall it know but sorrow.’

After that Philosophy, that is to say, the Spirit of Reason, had sung this song, she began again to speak, and she said to the Mind, ‘I see thou hast need of comfort rather than of woful words."
"Wherefore, if only thou wilt show shame for thine error, I will soon begin to raise thee up and carry thee with me to heaven.’

‘What,’ answered the sorrow-stricken Mind, ‘and is this the boon and the reward thou didst always promise them that would obey thee?"
"Is this wise Plato’s saw thou toldest me of long ago, that without righteousness no power was rightful?"
"Dost thou mark how the righteous are hated and oppressed because they are resolved to do thy will, and how the unrighteous are exalted by reason of their misdeeds and their self-esteem?"
"Even that they may do their wicked will the sooner, they are furthered with gifts and possessions."
"Therefore I will now call earnestly upon God.’

Then he began to sing, and these were the words of his song:

Edition: current; Page: [5]

IV

‘O THOU Creator of heaven and earth, that rulest on the eternal throne, Thou that makest the heavens to turn in swift course, and the stars to obey Thee, and the sun with his shining beams to quench the darkness of black night, (so too the moon with her pale beam maketh the stars to grow dim in the heaven, and at times robbeth the sun of his light, coming between him and us men; and that bright star too that we call the morning star, and which by its other name we call the evening star), Thou that givest short hours to the days of winter, and longer ones to those of summer, Thou that in autumn with the strong north-east wind spoilest the trees of their leaves, and again in spring givest them fresh ones with the soft south-west winds, lo!"
"all creatures do Thy will, and keep the ordinances of Thy commandments, save man only; he setteth Thee at naught."
"‘O Almighty Creator and Ruler of all things, help now Thy poor people!"
"Wherefore, O Lord, hast Thou ever suffered that Fate should change as she doth, for she oppresseth the innocent and harmeth not the guilty at all?"
"The wicked sit on thrones, and trample the saints under their feet; bright virtues abide in hiding, and the unrighteous mock the righteous."
"False swearing bringeth no harm to men, nor false guile that is cloaked with deceits."
"Wherefore well-nigh all men shall turn to doubt, if Fate shall change Edition: current; Page: [6]according to the will of wicked men, and Thou wilt not check her."
"‘O my Lord, Thou that beholdest all that Thou hast made, look now in Thy lovingkindness upon this miserable earth, and also upon all mankind, for that at this present it is all struggling with the waves of this world.’

V

WHILE the Mind was thus uttering his plaint and singing this song, Philosophy (that is to say, Reason) watched him with a cheerful eye, in no wise cast down for his melancholy, and she said unto him, ‘No sooner did I see thee lamenting thus and sorrowing than I perceived that thou hadst departed from thy native home—that is to say, from my teachings."
"Thou didst depart from it when thou didst forsake thy firm belief, and bethink thee that Fate ruled this world at her own pleasure, respectless of God’s will or leave, or of the deeds of men."
"I knew that thou hadst departed therefrom, but how far I knew not, until thou thyself didst make all clear to me in thy song of sorrow."
"But though thou hast indeed wandered farther than ever, yet art thou not utterly banished from thine home, though far astray."
"No one else hath led thee into error; ’twas thyself alone, by thine own heedlessness; nor would any man be led to expect this of thee if thou wouldst but remember thy birth and citizenship as the world Edition: current; Page: [7]P. 7. goes, or again, according to the spirit, of what fellowship thou wast in mind and understanding; for thou art one of the righteous and upright in purpose, that are citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem."
"From hence, that is, from his righteous purpose, no man is ever banished save he himself so chooseth."
"Wheresoever he be, he hath that ever with him, and having it he is with his own kin and his own fellow-citizens in his own land, being in the company of the righteous."
Whosoever then is worthy to be in their service hath perfect freedom.
"‘Nor do I shun this lowly and this foul dwelling, if only I find thee wise, nor do I care for walls wrought with glass, nor for thrones adorned with gold and gems, nor do I care so much for books written in letters of gold, as I care for a righteous will in thee."
"What I seek here is not books, but that which understands books, to wit, thy mind."
"Very rightly didst thou lament the injustice of Fate, both in the exalted power of the unrighteous and in mine own dishonour and neglect, and in the licence of the wicked as regards the prosperity of this world."
"But as both thine indignation and thy grief have made thee so desponding, I may not answer thee till the time be come."
For whatsoever man shall begin untimely hath no perfect ending.
‘When the sun’s beams shine hottest in the month of August he is foolish that would commit any seed to the dry furrows; so too is he that would look for flowers during the storms of winter.
"Nor canst thou Edition: current; Page: [8]press wine in midwinter, though thou wouldst fain drink of the warm must.’

Then Philosophy cried aloud and said, ‘May I then put thy fixed belief to the proof, that I may thereby get to know by what means and in what manner I am to cure thee?’

‘Prove me as thou wilt,’ answered the Mind."
"Then said Philosophy, ‘Dost thou believe that Fate rules this world, or that aught of good may happen without a Cause?’

‘I do not believe,’ replied the Mind, ‘that in that case anything could happen in such orderly fashion; nay, of a truth I know that God is the controller of His own work, and from that true faith I have never swerved.’

Then again Philosophy answered and said, ‘It was about this same thing thou wast singing but a little while ago, that each creature knew from God its due season, and fulfilled its due course, save only man."
"Wherefore I marvel beyond measure what ails thee, and why thou complainest, holding this faith."
But let us consider the matter yet more deeply.
"I do not fully know which of thy doubts remain; but thou sayest thou hast no doubt that God guideth this world; tell me then, how would He like it to be?’

P. Dost think I know not the danger of that confusion in which thou art wrapt around?"
"Come, tell me what is the end that every beginning is minded to have?"
"Edition: current; Page: [9]

M. I knew it once, but this sorrow of mine has reft me of the memory of it."
P. Knowest thou whence everything comes?
M. I know that everything comes from God.
"P. How can it be that, knowing the beginning, thou knowest not the end also?"
"Confusions may distract the mind, but cannot rob it of its understanding."
And I would have thee tell me whether thou knowest what thou art thyself?
"M. I know that I belong to living men, intelligent, yet doomed to die."
"P. Now I understand thy melancholy, seeing that thou thyself knowest not what thy nature is; and I know how to cure thee."
"Thou hast said that thou wast an outcast and bereft of all good, in that thou knewest not what thou wast, and thereby thou didst make known thine ignorance of the end that every beginning has in view, when thou didst think that unguided and reckless men were the happy ones and the rulers of this world."
"Furthermore, thou didst make known that thou knewest not with what guidance God ruleth this world, or how He would like it to be ordered, saying that thy belief was that this harsh Fate governs the world apart from the design of God."
"Indeed, there was great risk that thou shouldst think so, for not only wast thou in boundless misfortune, but thou hadst even well-nigh perished withal."
"Thank God Edition: current; Page: [10]therefore that He hath succoured thee, and that I have not utterly forsaken thine understanding."
"Now that thou believest that, apart from God’s design, Fate cannot by herself guide the world, we have fuel for thy salvation."
"Thou needest fear naught now, for from the little spark which thou settest to the under the light of life has shone upon thee."
"But it is not yet the time for me to hearten thee yet farther, for it is the habit of every mind to follow falsehood when once it hath forsaken the dictates of truth."
"From this have begun to gather the mists that perplex the understanding and utterly confound the true sight, even such mists as are now over thy mind."
"But first I must dissipate them, that afterwards I may the more easily be able to bring the true light unto thee."
"VI

‘BEHOLD the sun and the other heavenly bodies; when black clouds come before them, they can no longer give out their light."
"So too at times the south wind in fierce storms stirreth up the sea that before was in calm weather as clear as glass to look upon; but as soon as it is troubled by the surging waves it very quickly groweth gloomy, that was but now so smiling to behold."
"Lo, the brook also swerveth from its right course, when a great rock rolling from the high mountain falleth into it, parting its waters, and damming up its proper course."
Edition: current; Page: [11]Even so the gloom of thy troubled mind withstandeth the light of my teaching.
"But, if thou art desirous in good faith to know the true light, put away from thee evil joys and unprofitable, and also useless miseries and the evil dread of this world."
"That is to say, exalt not thyself beyond measure in thine health and happiness, nor do thou again despair of all good in any adversity, for the mind is ever bound about with confusion in which either of these two ills holdeth sway.’

VII

HEREUPON Philosophy was silent a little while until she had read the inmost thoughts of the Mind; and having read them she said, ‘If I have rightly read thy sadness, it comes to this, that thou hast utterly lost the worldly prosperity thou hadst once, and thou art now grieving over thy changed lot."
I perceive clearly enough that worldly prosperity cunningly lures with all manner of sweets the mind that it wishes at last to beguile most; and then in the end it brings the mind when she least weeneth to despair and deepest sorrow.
"If thou wilt know whence cometh prosperity, thou mayest observe that it comes from covetousness of worldly goods."
"Next, if thou wilt learn its nature, know that it remains true to no man."
"By this thou mayest understand that thou hadst no joy when fortune was thine, and in losing it thou hast suffered no loss thereof."
"I thought I long ago Edition: current; Page: [12]had taught thee to recognize it, and I knew thou didst shrink from it, even when thou hadst it, though thou didst profit thereby."
"Further, I knew thou didst oft repeat my sayings against it, but I know that no habit can be changed in a man without his mind being in some measure affected, and therefore thou art now bereft of thy peace of mind."
"‘O Mind, what has cast thee into this sorrow and trouble?"
"Thinkest thou this is something new or in any way unwonted that has come upon thee, such as has never ailed man before?"
"If thou thinkest it thine own fault that thy worldly prosperity is gone, then art thou in error, for its ways are even so."
"In thee it but fulfilled its own nature, and by its changing it made known its own instability."
"When it most flattered thee, it was the very same as it now is, though it was enticing thee to an unreal happiness."
Now hast thou perceived the fickle faith of blind pleasure; yet that which is now plain to thee is still hidden from many others.
"Now thou knowest the ways of worldly prosperity, and how it changeth."
"If then it is thy wish to be in its service, and thou likest its nature, why dost thou mourn so grievously?"
Why not change also in its company?
"If thou wouldst avoid its treachery, do thou despise it and drive it from thee, for it is tempting thee to thy ruin."
"That same prosperity, the loss of which thou art grieving over, would have left thee in peace, hadst thou but refused to accept it; and now it hath forsaken thee of its own will, not of thine, being such that no man loseth it Edition: current; Page: [13]without grief."
"Dost thou then count a thing so precious and so dear which is neither safe to hold nor easy to part with, and which, when it shall slip away from a man, he shall let go with the greatest wound to his mind?"
"Since therefore thou mayest not keep the joys of this world after thy will, and they bring thee to sorrow when they vanish from thee, why else do they come save as a foretokening of sorrow and pangs unrelieved?"
"Not on worldly wealth alone should a man fix his thoughts while he possesses it, but every prudent mind will consider the end thereof, and guard equally against its threats and its blandishments."
"If however thou art desirous to be its servant, thou must needs do cheerfully what belongs to its service, in obedience to its nature and its will; and, if thou wouldst have it put on other garb than is its will and its wont, art thou not then doing thyself dishonour, in that thou art rebelling against the lordship thou thyself hast freely chosen?"
And nevertheless thou shalt not be able to change its ways and kind.
Surely thou knowest that if thou spreadest out thy boat’s sail to the wind thou leavest all thy journey to the wind’s mercy.
So too if thou give thyself over to the service of worldly prosperity it is but right that thou shouldst follow its ways.
Thinkest thou that thou canst turn back the whirling wheel in its course?
No more canst thou turn aside the changing course of worldly riches.
P. 13.
‘I would speak still further with thee of riches.
Why didst thou reproach me just now that thou hadst Edition: current; Page: [14]lost thy riches for my sake?
"Why dost thou frown on me, as if for my sake bereft of thine own, both wealth and honour, both of which thou hadst from me when they were bestowed upon thee?"
"Come, plead thy case before whatsoever judge thou wilt; and if thou canst prove that any mortal man ever owned anything I will restore to thee whatsoever thou canst prove to have been thine own."
"I received thee foolish and untaught when first thou camest into the world, and I trained and taught thee, and brought thee to that wisdom wherewith thou didst win those worldly honours from which thou hast parted in such sorrow."
"Thou shouldst rather be thankful that thou hast well enjoyed my gifts, and not deem that thou hast lost aught of thine own."
What complaint then hast thou against me?
Have I ever robbed thee of any of the gifts which I gave thee?
"Every true blessing and every true honour is mine own servant, and, where I am, there are they too with me."
"Be well assured that, if that had been thine own wealth the loss of which thou mournest, thou couldst never have lost it."
"Oh how evilly I am entreated of many worldly men, in that I may not rule mine own servants!"
"The sky may bring bright days, and anon hide the light in darkness; the year may bring flowers, and the same year take them away again; the sea may enjoy her gentle heaving, and all things created may follow their course and fulfil their desire, save me alone."
"I only am deprived of mine own wont and use, and forced to strange ones through the unsated avarice of worldly men, who in their greed have robbed Edition: current; Page: [15]P. 15. me of the name I should rightly have, the name, that is, of blessing and honour; this they have wrested from me."
"Moreover, they have given me over to their evil practices, and made me minister to their false blessings, so that I cannot with my servants fulfil my service as all other creatures do."
"Now my servants are knowledge and skill of various kinds, and true riches; with these I have ever been wont to disport, and with them I sweep over the whole heavens."
"The lowest I raise up to the highest, and the highest I put in the lowest place; that is, the lowly I exalt to heaven, and bring blessings down from heaven unto the lowly."
"When I rise aloft with these my servants, we look down upon the storms of this world, even as the eagle does when he soars in stormy weather above the clouds where no storm can harm him."
"So would I have thee too, O Mind, come up to us if it please thee, on condition of returning again with us to earth to help good men."
"Thou knowest my ways, how I am ever earnest to succour the good in their need."
"Dost thou know how I helped Croesus the Greek king in his need, when Cyrus king of the Persians had taken him captive and was minded to burn him?"
When they cast him into the fire I set him free with rain from heaven.
"But thou wast too confident in thy righteousness and in thy good purpose, thinking that no unrighteous thing could come upon thee, and desiring to have the reward of all thy good works here in this life."
"How couldst thou dwell in the midst of a nation, and not suffer the same as other men?"
How live in the Edition: current; Page: [16]midst of change and not thyself be changed?
What do the poets sing of this world but the various changes thereof?
"And who art thou, not to change with it?"
"What is it to thee how thou changest, since I am always with thee?"
"It was even better for thee thus to change, that thou shouldst not grow too fond of worldly riches, and cease to expect still better things."
"‘Though the covetous man gain riches in number as the grains of sand by these sea-cliffs, or as the stars that shine of dark nights, he never leaveth to bewail his poverty; and though God glut the desire of wealthy men with gold and silver and all manner of precious things, yet is the thirst of their greed never quenched, for its bottomless abyss hath many empty chambers yet to fill."
Who can ever give enough to the frenzy of the covetous?
The more that is given him the greater his desire.
"‘How wilt thou answer Riches if she say to thee, “Why dost thou reproach me, O Mind?"
Why art thou enraged against me?
In what have I angered thee?
"’Twas thou that first desiredst me, not I thee; thou didst set me on the throne of thy Creator, when thou lookedst to me for the good thou shouldst seek from Him."
"Thou sayest I have deceived thee, but I may rather answer that thou hast deceived me, seeing that by reason of thy lust and thy greed the Creator of all things hath been forced to turn away from me."
"Thou art indeed more guilty than I, both for thine own wicked lusts and because owing to thee I am not able to do the will of my Maker."
"He lentEdition: current; Page: [17]me to thee to enjoy in accordance with His Commandments, and not to perform the will of thine unlawful greed.”

‘Answer us both now,’ said Philosophy, ‘as thou wilt; both of us await thine answer’

VIII

Pp."
17-18.
"THEN said the Mind, ‘I confess myself guilty on every point, and I am so sore stricken with remorse for my sin, that I cannot answer you.’

Again Philosophy spake, ‘It is still by reason of thine unrighteousness that thou art brought nearly to despair, and I would have thee not despair, but be ashamed of thine error."
"For he who despairs is without hope, while he who is ashamed is in the way to repentance."
"If thou wilt but call to mind all the worldly honours thou hast received since thy birth to this day, and reckon up the joys against the sorrows, thou canst not well say thou art poor and unhappy, for I took thee when young, untrained, and untaught, and made thee my child and brought thee up in my discipline."
"How then is it possible to speak of thee as aught but most happy, when thou wast dear to me ere thou knewest me, and before thou knewest my discipline and my ways, and before I taught thee in thy youth such wisdom as is hidden from many an older sage, and when I furthered thee with my teachings so that thou Edition: current; Page: [18]wast chosen of men to be a judge?"
"If however thou wilt say thou art unhappy because thou no longer hast the fleeting honours and joys that thou once didst have, still thou art not unblest, for thy present woe will pass away even as thou sayest thy joys have passed."
"Dost thou think such change of state and sadness of mood come to thee alone, and have never befallen, nor will befall, any other man?"
Or dost thou think that in any human mind there can be aught enduring and without change?
"If for a while anything endures in a man, death snatches it away, and its place knows it no more."
And what are worldly riches but a foretokening of death?
For death cometh to no other purpose but to take life.
"So also riches come to a man to rob him of that which is dearest to him in the world, and this they do when they depart from him."
"Tell me, O Mind, since naught in this life may endure unchanging, which deemest thou the better?"
"Art thou to despise these earthly joys, and willingly give them up without a pang, or to wait till they give thee up and leave thee sorrowing?’

IX

THEN Philosophy began to sing and chaunted thus: ‘When the sun shineth brightest in the cloudless heaven, he dimmeth the light of all the stars, for their brightness is as nothing compared with his."
"When the south-west breeze softly bloweth, the flowers of the field grow apace, but when Edition: current; Page: [19]the strong wind cometh out of the north-east, right soon it destroyeth the beauty of the rose."
"Again, the north wind in its fury lasheth the calm ocean."
Alas!
"there is nothing in the world that endureth firmly for every!’

X

P. 19."
"THEN said Boethius, ‘O Philosophy, thou that art the mother of all virtues, I cannot gainsay thee nor deny what thou wast saying to me just now, for it is all true."
"I understand now that my happiness and the prosperity which I erstwhile accounted happiness are not such, seeing that they so speedily depart."
"What troubles me most when I ponder the matter narrowly is my firm persuasion that the greatest unhappiness in this present life is for a man to have happiness, and then to lose it.’

Then answered Philosophy, that is to say Reason, ‘Of a truth thou shouldst not blame thy fate and thy prosperity, as thou art minded to do, for the loss of false joys that thou art suffering, because thou art wrong in thinking thyself unhappy."
But if it be the loss of fancied joys that hath thus troubled and saddened thee I can clearly prove to thee that thou still hast the greater part of the happiness that once was thine.
"Tell me now, canst thou with justice bewail thy misfortune, as if good fortune had utterly forsaken thee?"
"Why, thou hast still the most precious part of all that thou didst hold most worth having."
"How then canst thou Edition: current; Page: [20]bewail the worse and more harmful part, having kept the more precious?"
"Come, thou knowest that the flower of mankind and the greatest honour to thyself is still living, even thy wife’s father, Symmachus."
"He is yet hale and hearty, and hath enough of all good things, and I know that thou wouldst not stick to lay down thy life for him, if thou wert to see him in any danger, for the man is full of wisdom and goodly parts, and free enough from all earthly cares, albeit he is much grieved for thy hardships and thy captivity."
"Is not thy wife also living, daughter of this same Symmachus, a virtuous and modest lady, beyond all women in chastity?"
All the good in her I may sum up in a word: that in all her ways she is her father’s daughter.
"For thee she lives, for thee alone, as she loves nothing else but thee; every blessing of this life is hers, but all hath she scorned for thy sake, refusing all, not having thee; that is her only want."
"By reason of thine absence all that she hath seems naught to her, for in her great love for thee she is in despair and well-nigh dead with weeping and sorrow."
"Again, let us take thy two sons."
"They are magistrates and senators; in them are manifest the gifts and virtues of their father and of their forefathers, as far as young men may resemble their elders."
"Therefore I wonder that thou canst not understand that thou art still very fortunate, being alive and in good health."
"Surely to be alive and well is the greatest gift mortal man may have, and besides this thou hast all those gifts that I have just told over to thee."
"Indeed, these are even more precious to a man than life itself; for Edition: current; Page: [21]many a man would rather die himself than see his wife and children die."
Why then art thou disposed to weep without cause?
"As yet thou canst not in aught reproach thy fate, nor put the blame upon thy life; nor art thou, as thou thinkest, utterly undone."
"No unbearable affliction hath yet befallen thee, for thine anchor is still fast in the ground, those noblemen, I mean, that we were speaking of."
"They will not suffer thee to despair of this present life; and furthermore, thine own faith and the divine love and hope, these three will not suffer thee to despair of the life eternal.’

To this the sorrowing Mind made answer, saying, ‘Oh, would that the anchors were as fast and enduring, in respect of God and of the world, as thou sayest!"
"Then could I far more easily bear such adversities as might befall me, for they all seem lighter as long as the anchors hold."
"But nevertheless thou mayest perceive how my happiness and worldly honour are changed.’

XI

THEN answered Philosophy, that is Reason, and said, ‘Indeed I thought to have raised thee somewhat from thy sadness, and almost restored thee to the same position that thou once hadst, but thou art even yet too sated with that which is left thee, and therefore thou art filled with loathing."
"Yet I cannot suffer thy lamentation for the little thou hast lost; for ever with weeping and dolour thou art Edition: current; Page: [22]complaining if thou failest to get anything on which thy desire is set, however small it be."
"What man ever lived in this life or shall live after us in this world, and nothing cross his will, whether little or great?"
"Very narrow and very paltry is human happiness, for either it cometh not to any man, or abideth not steadily with him such as it was when it came; this I will show more clearly later on."
"‘We know that many have worldly riches enough, but they are ashamed of their wealth if they are not as well born as they would desire."
"Some again are noble and famous from their high birth, but they are oppressed and saddened by their base estate and their poverty, so that they would rather be of mean birth than so poor, were it but in their power."
"Many are both well born and well endowed, yet are joyless, being wedded to an ill-matched or unpleasing wife."
"Many are happy enough in their marriage, but being childless must leave all the wealth they amass to strangers to enjoy, and therefore they are sad."
"Some have children enough, but these are perhaps weakly, or wicked and ignoble, or they die young, so that their parents sorrow for them all their days."
"Therefore no man may in this present life altogether withstand Fate; for even if he have nothing now to grieve about, yet he may grieve not to know what his future will be, whether good or evil, even as thou also didst not know; and moreover, that which he enjoys so happily while he hath it, he dreads to lose."
"Show me, I pray thee, the man who to thy mind is most happy, and who is most given over to self-indulgence; Edition: current; Page: [23]I will soon cause thee to see that he is often exceedingly put out by the veriest trifles if anything, however slight, thwart his will or his habits, unless he can beckon every one to run at his bidding."
A very little thing may make the happiest of men in this world believe his happiness to be impaired or altogether lost.
"Thou art thinking now, for instance, that thou art very unhappy, and yet I know that many a man would fancy himself raised up to heaven if he had any part of the happiness which is still remaining to thee."
"Why, the place where thou art now imprisoned, and which thou callest exile, is a home to them that were born there, and also to them that live in it by choice."
"Nothing is bad, unless a man think it bad; and though it be hard to bear and adverse, yet is it happiness if a man does it cheerfully and bears it with patience."
Few are so wise as not to wish in their impatience that their fortune may be changed.
"With the sweets of this world much bitterness is mingled; though they seem desirable, yet a man cannot keep them, once they begin to flee from him."
Is it not then plain that worldly happiness is a poor thing?
"It is unable to satisfy poor man, who ever desireth what he hath not at the time, and even with men of patience and of sober life it will never long abide."
‘Why then do ye seek outside yourselves the happiness ye have planted within you by the divine power?
"But ye know not what ye do, being in error."
"I will show you in a few words what is the pinnacle of all happiness; towards which I know that thou, O Mind, Edition: current; Page: [24]wilt hasten before even thou perceivest it; it is Goodness."
What is more precious to thee than thyself?
"Nothing, I think thou wilt say."
"Well I know that if thou hadst full governance of thyself thou wouldst have something within thee which thou wouldst never willingly give up, and which Fate could not wrest from thee."
"Let me remind thee that there is in this present life no other happiness but Wisdom, for nothing can make men lose it; and that possession which can never be lost is better than that which can, and some day must."
Is it not now quite clearly proven that Fate can give thee no happiness?
"For both Fate and Happiness are inconstant, and therefore these joys are very frail and very perishable."
"Now every man that possesses these joys either knows that they will depart from him, or he does not know it."
"If he knows it not, what happiness hath he in his prosperity, being so foolish and unwise as not to know it?"
"But, if he does know it, he dreads to lose his prosperity, knowing full well that he must forfeit it."
"Continual fear, too, prevents him from being happy."
"If then anyone care not whether he have it or have it not, why, that must be little or no happiness, when a man can so easily part from it."
"Methinks I have before this proved to thee clearly enough, by many tokens, that human souls are immortal and everlasting, and it is plain enough that no man need doubt but that death is the end of all men, and of their riches also."
"Therefore I marvel why men are so unreasonable as to think this present life can make a man happy while he lives, when it cannot make Edition: current; Page: [25]P. 25. him miserable hereafter."
"Indeed, we know of many and many a man that hath sought eternal happiness not merely by seeking the death of the body, but by desiring many most grievous tortures, so that he might win eternal life; of such were all the holy martyrs.’

XII

THEN Philosophy began to chaunt a lay, and sang thus; she added song to her discourse, and these were her words: ‘He that would build a house to last must not place it high on the hilltop; and he that desireth Divine Wisdom cannot find it with pride."
"Again, he that would build an enduring habitation should not set it on sandhills."
"So also, if thou will build up Wisdom, base it not on covetousness, for as the crumbling sand drinketh up the rain, so covetousness swalloweth up the fleeting goods of this earth, being ever athirst for them."
"No house may stand for long on a high hill if a very mighty wind assail it; nor again one that is built on crumbling sand, by reason of the heavy rains."
"So too the soul of man is undermined and moved from its place when the wind of sore hardship assaileth it, or the rain of excessive anxiety."
"Whoever would seek eternal happiness must flee from the perilous beauty of this earth, and build the house of his mind upon the firm rock of humility, for Christ dwelleth in the Valley of Humility, and in the memory of Wisdom."
"Therefore it is thatEdition: current; Page: [26]the wise man spendeth all his life in joy unchangeable and freedom from care, despising these earthly delights and those that are evil, and putting his hope in the joys to come, that are eternal."
"For God encompasseth him on every side, living as he doth ever in the joys of the soul, though the wind of adversity blow against him, and the ceaseless care begotten of worldly pleasures.’

XIII

HAVING sung this lay, Philosophy, that is, Reason, took up once more her argument, and spake on this wise: ‘Methinks that we may now speak in more searching and darker words, for I perceive that my teaching is in some measure penetrating thy mind, and thou understandest well enough what I say to thee."
"Consider, therefore, how much of all these worldly possessions and riches is thine own, and which of them when closely considered cannot be replaced?"
"What profit hast thou from the gifts that Fate, as thou sayest, giveth thee, and from wealth, even if they last for ever?"
"Tell me, is it thou that givest value to thy wealth, or is it valuable in its own nature?"
"No matter, I tell thee that it is so by its own nature, not by thine."
"If so, how art thou in any respect the better for that wherein it is good?"
"Tell me now what thou accountest most precious; is it gold, or what is it?"
"Gold, I doubt not."
"But though this be at present good and valuable, Edition: current; Page: [27]yet he is more delightful and beloved that bestows it than he that hoards it and takes it from others."
Likewise wealth is more popular and delightful when given away than when hoarded and kept.
"Now, covetousness makes the covetous hateful both to God and to man, while virtue makes its possessor beloved, praised, and respected of God, and of those men who cherish it."
"Since the same thing cannot be his that giveth it and his to whom it is given, therefore it is better and more precious when given than when withheld."
"If then all the riches of this world were to fall into the hands of one man, would not all other men be poor?"
"Surely good report and good esteem are for every man better and more precious than any wealth; for behold, the report filleth the ears of all who hear it, yet he who speaketh it suffereth no loss."
"It revealeth the secrets of his own heart and passeth into the recesses of that of his hearer, and on the journey between them it groweth not less; no man can slay it with the sword, nor bind it with cords, and it never dieth."
"But of your riches, though they be ever with you, ye have never sufficient, and, though ye give them to other men, ye cannot any the more satisfy their poverty and their greed."
"Though thou divide them fine as dust, thou canst not satisfy all men alike with them, and when thou hast divided them thou remainest poor thyself."
"The riches of this world are paltry things, as no man can have enough of them, nor be enriched by them, without making some other man poor."
"Tell me, does the beauty of gems attract your eyes to marvel at Edition: current; Page: [28]them?"
"Surely, I know it does."
"Now this quality of beauty in them is theirs, and not yours."
"Therefore I am greatly astonished how ye men can think the beautiful substance of such senseless things better than your own good qualities, and how ye can admire gems or any other perishable thing that hath not sense; for on no grounds can they deserve your admiration."
"Though they are God’s creatures, yet they are not to be compared with you, for a thing is either not good compared with you, or at any rate of small excellence."
"We debase ourselves too much when we love what is subject to us more than we love ourselves, or the Lord who created us and gave us all good things."
"Now, does it please thee to behold a fair country-side?’

XIV

THEN the Mind answered Philosophy and said, ‘Why should I not be pleased to behold a fair country-side?"
Is it not the fairest part of God’s creation?
"Ofttimes we admire the calm ocean and marvel at the beauty of sun and moon and all the stars.’

Thereupon Philosophy, that is Reason, answered Mind: ‘But what hast thou to do with their beauty?"
Darest thou boast it to be from thee?
"Nay, not at all."
"Thou knowest that none of these things is thy handiwork; but, if thou must glory, glory in God."
"Dost thou take pleasure in fair flowers in the spring, as if Edition: current; Page: [29]P. 29. thou wert their creator?"
"Couldst thou create any such thing, or maintain it when it is created?"
"Nay, by no means."
Make not then any such attempt.
Art thou the cause that autumn is so rich in fruits?
Do I not know thou art not?
"Why then art thou aglow with such vain pleasure, why so immoderate in thy delight in things not thine, as if they were truly thine own?"
Dost thou think Fate can cause those things to belong to thee that their own nature makes alien to thee?
"Nay, indeed, it is not thy nature to possess them, nor is it their obligation to obey thee."
"But heavenly things naturally belong to thee, not earthly ones."
"Now these fruits of the earth were created for the subsistence of beasts of the field, and riches were created to delude those men who are like unto the beasts, to wit, the unrighteous and intemperate; to such men riches come oftenest."
"If therefore thou wouldst know what is due measure and what is needful, I tell thee it is meat and drink and clothes, and implements wherewith to exercise the powers thou hast, and that are natural to thee, and that may be rightly used."
"What profit is there for thee to crave beyond measure the riches of this life, when they can help neither thee nor themselves?"
"Very little of them is enough for our natural wants, even such as we have above mentioned."
"If thou have more of them, either it worketh thee harm, or it is unpleasant to thee, or noisome or dangerous, whatever thou dost in excess."
"For example, if thou eat or drink in excess, or wear more clothes than thou art in need of, this superfluity brings grief to thee, or loathing, or Edition: current; Page: [30]perhaps mischance and danger."
"If thou deemest that splendid raiment is any honour, then I account the honour his who made it, and not thine; and as God is the maker, it is His skill I praise therein."
Or dost thou think the number of thy followers renders thee honourable?
"No, indeed; for if they be wicked and deceitful, then are they more dangerous and troublesome in thy service than out of it, for bad servants are ever their master’s foes."
"Supposing, however, they are good and loyal and true men, is not this to their advantage rather than thine?"
"How canst thou then claim the advantage that belongs to them, since in boasting of it dost thou not boast of what is theirs, not thine own?"
"It is now clear enough that none of the blessings we have been speaking of, and which thou deemedst thine, really belong to thee."
"If then the beauty and wealth of this world are not desirable, why dost thou repine after that which thou hast lost, or why regret that which was once thine?"
"If it is beautiful, that is by virtue of its own nature, not of thine; its beauty is its own, not thine."
Why dost thou regret a beauty that is not thine?
"Wilt thou take delight in what concerns thee not, and which thou hast not created nor dost possess?"
"These things are good and desirable, for so they are created, and would be so even if thou never hadst them for thine own."
Surely thou dost not believe they are the more precious for being lent to thee for thy use?
"Nay, it is simply because foolish men marvel at riches and prize them that thou gatherest them together and storest them up in thine Edition: current; Page: [31]hoard."
What profit hast thou then from such happiness as this?
"Believe me when I tell thee thou hast none; but, seeking to escape poverty, thou dost put by more than is needful for thee."
Nevertheless I doubt not that all I am saying in this matter accordeth not with thy wish.
"Your blessings are not what ye men account them to be, for he that would possess great and varied estate needeth much help to carry it."
"The old saw is very true that was said by the ancients, that they need much who will have much, and their need is little who are content with enough."
"Nevertheless men would fain glut their avarice with superfluity, but to this they can never attain."
"Ye believe, I am sure, that ye have no natural good nor blessing within you, inasmuch as ye seek these in other creatures without."
"’Tis a crooked wisdom to think that man, though of a godlike understanding, hath in himself no sufficiency of happiness, but must gather together more of the creatures of no understanding than he needeth or is fitting."
"The unreasoning beasts of the field desire no other possession, but are satisfied with the content of their own hides, together with their natural food."
And lo!
"ye have something divine in your souls, even Reason and Memory, and the discerning Will to choose."
"He therefore that hath these three hath his Creator’s likeness, in so far as any creature may have it."
"But ye look for the blessings and glory of a higher nature in the lower things that perish, not discerning how grievously ye offend God your Maker, who would that all men were lords of all other creatures."
"Nay rather, ye make your Edition: current; Page: [32]chiefest excellence subject to the most lowly of created things, declaring that by your own free judgement ye rank yourselves below your own chattels, thinking as ye do that your happiness lies in false wealth, and that all your possessions are of more value than yourselves."
And so they are as long as ye wish it to be so.
‘The nature of men is that they surpass all other creatures only in that they know what they are and whence they came; but they are lower than the beasts in that their will holdeth not with their knowledge.
"The nature of beasts is to have no knowledge of themselves, but in man it is a blemish not to have self-knowledge."
Now thou dost plainly perceive that men err in thinking any man may be held in honour for the wealth that is not his own.
"If therefore a man be held in honour for wealth, and ennobled for his rich possessions, doth not the honour belong to him that bestoweth it, and is he not more rightly to be praised?"
"None the fairer is that which is adorned from without, howsoever fair the adornment wherein it is dressed, and if it was before foul it is none the fairer thereby."
"On the contrary, no good thing hurteth a man."
"Lo, thou knowest I lie not, and also that riches oft harm their owners in many ways, and especially in the puffing up of a man, so that many a time the worst and most unworthy of all cometh to think himself worthy to have all the wealth in the world, if he could only get it."
"He that hath much wealth dreadeth many foes; if he had nothing, no need would there be for him to fear any one."
"If thou wert a traveller, and hadst much gold Edition: current; Page: [33]on thee, and wert to fall among a company of robbers, why, thou wouldst despair of thy life; whereas, if thou hadst nothing about thee, thou wouldst need to fear naught, but couldst go thy way singing the old verse that was sung of yore, that the naked wayfarer hath naught to dread.’ Being then free from care, and the robbers departed, thou couldst mock at wealth, saying, “Verily a fine and pleasant thing is it to have great riches when he that hath them hath no peace.” ’

P. 33."
"WHEN Philosophy had spoken this speech, she began to sing, and said, ‘Ah, how blessed was the former age of the world, when each man was content with what the earth yielded!"
"No splendid mansions were there then; no varied dainties nor drinks; nor did men covet costly apparel, for as yet these things were not; neither were they seen nor heard of."
"Men cared not for any wicked pleasure, but followed the path of nature in strict measure."
"They ate but once in the day, and that was towards evening."
"The fruits of trees they ate, and roots; they drank no wine unmixed, nor knew to mingle honey with their drink, nor desired silken raiment of various hues."
Always they slept out of doors in the shade of the trees; pure spring water was their drink.
"No merchant had gazed on strand nor island, and no man had heard tell of the pirate host,Edition: current; Page: [34]nor even of any fighting whatever."
"Not yet was earth defiled with the blood of the slain, nor had a man been wounded."
"Evil men had not been seen as yet; no honour had such then, no love."
"Alas, that our age cannot become as that was!"
"In these days the greed of men burneth like the fire of hell that is in the mountain called Etna, in the isle of Sicily."
"This mountain is ever on fire with brimstone, consuming all the countries round about."
"Alas, who was the first covetous man that began to dig in the ground for gold, and for gems, and brought to light precious things up to that time hidden and covered by the earth?’

XVI

WHEN Philosophy had sung this song, she began to speak again; and said, ‘What more can I say to thee concerning the honour and power in this world?"
"With this power ye men would fain rise to heaven, if ye could."
"That is because ye do not remember nor even understand the nature of the heavenly power and honour, which is your own, seeing ye came from heaven."
"Now, if your wealth and your power (which ye now call honours) fall into the hands of an utterly bad man, and most unworthy to have them, as, for instance, this very Theodoric, and long ago the Caesar Nero, and many others like unto them, will he not act as they did, and yet do?"
"They destroy and ravage all theEdition: current; Page: [35]countries subject to them, or anywhere within their reach, even as fire consumeth the dry heath, or as the burning brimstore of the mount we call Etna that is in the isle of Sicily; or like unto the flood that was of old in Noah’s days."
"I think thou wilt remember that your forefathers, the Roman senators, in the days of Torcwine [Tarquin], the haughty king, were forced by his pride to banish the name of king from Rome for the first time, and would have banished in their turn, for their pride, even those chief men that had helped to drive him out, had they been able; for the rule of those men pleased the Roman senators yet worse than the former rule of the kings."
"If then it happens, as it seldom does, that power and honour fall to a good and wise man, what is there that deserves our liking but the virtues and honourable character of the good king himself, and not of his power?"
"For power is never a good thing, save its possessor be good; for when power is beneficent this is due to the man who wields it."
"Therefore it is that a man never by his authority attains to virtue and excellence, but by reason of his virtue and excellence he attains to authority and power."
"No man is better for his power, but for his skill he is good, if he is good, and for his skill he is worthy of power, if he is worthy of it."
"Study Wisdom then, and, when ye have learned it, contemn it not, for I tell you that by its means ye may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it."
"Ye need not take thought for power nor endeavour after it, for if ye are only wise and good it will follow you, evenEdition: current; Page: [36]P. 36though ye seek it not."
"Tell me now, O Mind, what is the height of thy desire in wealth and power?"
Is it not this present life and the perishable wealth that we before spoke of?
"O ye foolish men, do ye know what riches are, and power, and worldly weal?"
"They are your lords and rulers, not ye theirs."
"Suppose ye saw a mouse, a ruler and lawgiver of mice, exacting tribute of them, how marvellous it would seem to you, and with what laughter would ye be shaken!"
And yet compared with his mind a man’s body is as a mouse’s body compared to a man’s.
"Now, if ye think of it, ye may easily believe that man’s body is more frail than that of any other living thing."
"The smallest fly can hurt it, and gnats with their tiny stings poison it; and even little worms torment man within and without, and sometimes nearly kill him, yea and even the little flea may kill him."
Such creatures may harm him within and without.
"Again, one man can injure another only in the body, or at least in those worldly possessions that ye call happiness."
"But no man can harm the discerning mind, nor make it other than it is; and this is very evident in the Roman prince called Liberius, who was put to many tortures for refusing to tell the names of his comrades in the plot to kill the king, who had unjustly oppressed them."
"When he was led before the cruel king and commanded to say who his accomplices were, he bit off his own tongue and dashed it in the king’s face."
And so it fell out that that which the king meant as a punishment brought praise and honour to this Edition: current; Page: [37]wise man.
"What harm can one man do another, and not suffer the same from him; or, if not from the same man, then from another?"
We have also learnt about the savage tyrant Bosiris the Egyptian.
"It was the custom of this oppressor to receive every comer with great honour, and treat him as a friend immediately on his coming; but afterwards, before it was time for his departure, he would have him put to death."
"Now it happened that Erculus [Hercules], son of Jobe [Jove], came to him, and the king thought to treat him as he had treated many a former visitor, drowning him in the river called Nile."
"But Erculus was the stronger, and drowned him instead, very rightly and by God’s will, even as he had drowned others."
"And Regulus too, that most famous captain that fought against the Africans; he had won an almost unspeakable victory over them, and, when the slaughter was over, he had the enemy tied together and laid out in heaps."
But very soon after it came to pass that he himself was bound in their fetters.
"Lo, now!"
"what is the good of power, thinkest thou, when it cannot in any wise prevent him that holds it from suffering the same ill that he once did to others?"
Is not power in this case a thing of naught?
"Again, dost thou think that if honour and power were wittingly good, and had control over themselves, they would obey the most infamous men as they now often do?"
Knowest thou not that contraries by their nature and habit may not mix nor have any intercourse?
"Nature abhors such admixture, which is as impossible as that good Edition: current; Page: [38]P. 38. and evil should live together."
"But thou seest clearly that this present authority and worldly prosperity and dominion are not good of their own nature and by their own will, and have no control over their own actions, cleaving as they do to the worst men, and suffering them to be their lords; for it is certain that the most infamous men often attain to power and honours."
"If then power of its own nature and by its own might were good, it would never countenance evil, but good men."
"The same may be looked for in all blessings brought by Fate during our life here, both with respect to powers of mind and to possessions, for at times they fall to the basest of men."
"Surely no man doubts that he is strong that is seen to perform a feat of strength, just as, if he gives evidence of any other quality, we doubt not but that he really has it."
"[Here endeth the first book of Boethius, and beginneth the second.]"
"For example, music makes a man a musician, and physic makes him a physician, and logic makes him a logician."
"Likewise the law of nature prevents good from mixing with evil in a man, and evil with good."
"Though both be in a man, either is separate from the other, for, nature not allowing contrary things to mingle, the one shuns the other, and strives to be itself alone."
"Wealth cannot make a miser not covetous, nor sate his boundless greed; nor can power render its owner powerful."
"Since, therefore, every creature shuns its opposite, and strives amain to repel it, what two things can be more opposed than good and evil, which we never findEdition: current; Page: [39]conjoined?"
"Thus, then, thou mayest understand that if the joys of this present life had control over themselves and were good in their own nature they would ever cleave to him who used them for good and not for evil."
"But when they happen to be good they are so by the goodness of him that uses them for good, and he gets his goodness from God; whereas, if a bad man have them, they are evil by reason of the evil of him that doth evil with them, and through the working of the devil."
"Of what good is wealth therefore, when it cannot satisfy the boundless greed of the covetous, or power, which cannot make its possessor powerful, his desires binding him with their unbreakable fetters?"
"Though power be given to a bad man, it doth not make him good or excellent if he was not so before, but it revealeth his wickedness if he was wicked before, and sheweth it in a clear light if before it was not manifest."
"For, though he aforetime desired evil, he knew not how he could fully display it until such time as he should have attained to full power."
"This comes, O men, from your foolish delight in making a name, and calling that happiness which is no happiness, and that excellent which hath no excellence; for such things declare by their end, when it comes, that they are neither one nor the other."
Therefore it must not be thought that wealth and power and honours are true happiness.
"Briefly, then, we may say that of the worldly joys brought by Fate not one is to be desired, for in them is to be found no natural goodness; and this is clear because they never attach themselves to Edition: current; Page: [40]the good, nor make good the evil man they most often flock to.’

After Philosophy had finished this discourse, she began to chaunt again, and said, ‘Lo, we have heard what cruelties, what ruin, what adulteries, what sins, and what savage deeds were wrought by the unrighteous Caesar Nero."
"Once he had the whole city of Rome set on fire at the same time after the fashion of the burning of Troy of old, wishing to see how long and how brightly it would burn, compared with the latter town."
"Again, he commanded all the wisest men of Rome to be put to death, nay, even his own mother and brother; yea, even his own wife he put to the sword; and for such deeds he was never the sorrier, but was the more merry and rejoiced therefor."
"Nevertheless, during such deeds of wrong, all the world, from east to west, and from north to south, was subject to him; all was his dominion."
"Dost thou think the divine power could not have taken his power away from this unrighteous Caesar, and put an end to his madness, if it had so pleased?"
"Yes indeed, I know it could if it had wished."
"Alas, what a grievous yoke he laid on them that were living on earth in his days, and how often was his sword stained with innocent blood!"
"Is it not now clear enough that his power was not good of itself, since he to whom it was given was no good man?’

Edition: current; Page: [41]

P. 41."
WHEN Philosophy had sung this song she was silent for a time.
"Then the Mind answered, saying, ‘O Philosophy, thou knowest that I never greatly delighted in covetousness and the possession of earthly power, nor longed for this authority, but I desired instruments and materials to carry out the work I was set to do, which was that I should virtuously and fittingly administer the authority committed unto me."
"Now no man, as thou knowest, can get full play for his natural gifts, nor conduct and administer government, unless he hath fit tools, and the raw material to work upon."
"By material I mean that which is necessary to the exercise of natural powers; thus a king’s raw material and instruments of rule are a well-peopled land, and he must have men of prayer, men of war, and men of work."
"As thou knowest, without these tools no king may display his special talent."
"Further, for his materials he must have means of support for the three classes above spoken of, which are his instruments; and these means are land to dwell in, gifts, weapons, meat, ale, clothing, and what else soever the three classes need."
"Without these means he cannot keep his tools in order, and without these tools he cannot perform any of the tasks entrusted to him."
"I have desired material for the exercise of government that my talents and my power might not be forgotten Edition: current; Page: [42]and hidden away, for every good gift and every power soon groweth old and is no more heard of, if Wisdom be not in them."
"Without Wisdom no faculty can be fully brought out, for whatsoever is done unwisely can never be accounted as skill."
"To be brief, I may say that it has ever been my desire to live honourably while I was alive, and after my death to leave to them that should come after me my memory in good works.’

P. 42."
"WHEN this was spoken, the Mind was silent; and Philosophy began to discourse again, and spake on this wise: ‘O Mind, there is one evil which must be shunned, that very constantly and very grievously deceiveth the minds of men that are choice by nature, but not yet arrived at the highest point of perfect virtue; I mean the desire of false glory and unrighteous power, and fame beyond measure for good works among all people."
"Many men desire power, wishing to have good report, though they are unworthy of it; yea, even the most infamous desire this."
"But he that is wise and earnest in his quest of good report soon perceiveth how small a thing it is, how fleeting, how frail, and void of all good."
"If then thou wilt keenly consider, and look into the compass of the whole earth from east to west, and from north to south, as thou mayest read in the book that is called Astralogium, thou wilt perceive that Edition: current; Page: [43]compared with heaven all this earth is but as a tiny dot on a wide board, or as a boss on a shield, according to the judgement of the learned."
"Dost thou not remember what thou didst read in the works of Ptolemy, who in one of his books has set out the measurements of all this earth?"
"There thou mayest see that mankind and beasts take up not nearly one fourth of that part of the earth that can be travelled through, for what with heat and what with cold it is not all fit for them to dwell in, and the greater part is taken up by the ocean."
"Now subtract from the fourth part all the tract covered by the sea, and all its encroachments in the form of inlets, and the parts taken up by fens, and moors, and all the deserts in any land, and thou wilt perceive that there is left for man to dwell in the merest little plot of ground, as it were."
How foolish if ye were therefore to toil and strain all your days to blazon your fame far and wide over such a little plot; since the part of the world in which men dwell is but a point compared to the rest.
"Is your boast then a liberal, or magnificent, or worthy one, that ye dwell on half the fifth part of the earth, so narrowed is it, what with seas and marshes withal?"
"Why then do ye desire so immoderately to extend your name over this tenth part, for it is no more, what with sea and fen and all?"
"Again, consider this small enclosure that we have been speaking about, whereon dwell such a number and variety of races, all diverse in speech, and habits, and customs, over which ye now so extravagantly desire to spread your name."
"This ye can never do, for their speech is Edition: current; Page: [44]divided into two and seventy tongues, and each tongue is further parted out among many peoples; and the nations are severed and kept apart by the sea, and by forests, and mountains, and marshes, and by divers deserts and impassable regions over which even the merchants do not journey."
"How can the name of any one ruler reach places where the very name of the city where he liveth, and of the nation where he hath his dwelling, is utterly unheard of?"
"I know not for what folly ye desire to spread your names over all the earth, as ye cannot do, nor come near doing."
"Thou hast heard, I suppose, how great was the Romans’ dominion in the days of the chieftain [consul] Marcus, whose second name was Tullius and his third Cicero."
"Well, in one of his books, he mentions that the fame of Rome had not yet crossed the mountains called Caucasus, nor had the Scythians, who dwell on the other side of those mountains, ever heard the name of that city or people."
"It had come first to the Parthians, and even to them it was still very new."
And yet it was a name of dread to many a neighbouring people.
"Do ye not then understand how narrow must be your fame, which ye toil and strive unduly to spread abroad?"
"How great, thinkest thou, is the fame, and how great the honour, that a single Roman can get in a land that even the name of his city and all the glory of its people have never reached?"
"Though a man without measure and unduly desire to spread his fame over all the earth, he cannot bring it to pass, for the customs of nations are so diverse, and so various are their ways, that one Edition: current; Page: [45]country likes best that which another most mislikes, and even deems worthy of heavy punishment."
"Hence no man can have equal fame in every land, the likings of nations being so different."
"Therefore let every man be content to be well esteemed in his own country, for, even if he desire more, he cannot attain to it, since a number of men seldom agree in liking the same thing."
"This is why the fame of a man remains confined to the country where he hath his dwelling, and likewise because it hath often cruelly happened, through the sloth and neglect and carelessness of unlucky historians, that the character and deeds of the foremost and most ambitious men of their day have been left unwritten."
"And even if the writers had written of their lives and deeds, as they would have done if good for anything, would not their writings sooner or later have grown too old, and perished out of mind, as certain writers and the men they wrote of have done?"
"And yet ye men think to have eternal honour, if ye can by lifelong effort earn glory after your days!"
"If thou wilt compare the moments of this present fleeting life with those of the life unending, what do they come to?"
"Compare the length of time in which thine eye can wink with ten thousand years, and there is some likeness, though not much, since each hath a term."
"Now compare ten thousand years, or more if thou wilt, with everlasting and eternal life; here thou findest nothing in common, for ten thousand years, though it seem long, doth come to an end, while of the other there is no end."
Thus then the finite and the infinite cannot Edition: current; Page: [46]be measured together.
"If thou wert to count from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, and set all those years against infinity, there would still be no comparison."
"So it is also with the fame of great men; it may sometimes last long, and endure many years, yet is it very short when compared with that which never endeth."
"Nevertheless ye care not to do good for aught else save for the poor praise of the people, and for this shortlived fame we have been speaking of."
"This ye strive to win, neglecting the powers of your reason, of your understanding, and of your judgement; desiring to have as the reward of your good deeds the good report of unknown men, a reward which ye should seek from God alone."
"‘Thou hast heard, I suppose, of a very wise and very mighty man of old, who fell to questioning and railing at a philosopher."
"The latter was swollen with self-conceit and used to vaunt his philosophy, not making it known by his intelligence, but by his false and overweening boasts."
"The wise man, wishing to prove him, whether he was as clever as he thought himself, began to mock and revile him."
"The philosopher for a time listened quite patiently to the words of the other, but, hearing his taunts, he lost patience and began to defend himself, though up to this he pretended to be a philosopher."
So he asked the wise man whether he thought he was a philosopher or not.
"“I would call thee one,” said the wise man, “if thou wert patient and couldst hold thy peace.” How wearisome was the fame that the philosopher had heretofore sought with falsehood!Edition: current; Page: [47]Why, he broke down instantly at that one answer!"
"What availed the best of those that were before us their eager desire for idle glory and renown after their death, or what avails it now to us that are still alive?"
"More useful were it for every man to desire virtues than false fame, for what can fame do for him after body and soul are sundered?"
"Do we not know that all men die in the flesh, although the soul liveth on?"
"For the soul passeth freely to heaven once she is set free and released from the prison of this body, and she despiseth all these things of earth, and delighteth in being able to enjoy the heavenly things after she is sundered from the earthly."
"So the Mind itself will be its own witness of God’s will.’

WHEN Philosophy had made an end of her discourse she began again to chaunt, and this was what she sang: ‘Whosoever wisheth to have idle renown and useless vainglory, let him behold on the four sides of him, and see how spacious is the vault of heaven, and how strait the spread of earth, though to us it seem so broad."
"Then he may be ashamed of the extent of his own fame, being unable even to spread it over this narrow earth."
"O ye proud ones, why do ye desire to put your necks under that deadly yoke?"
or why are ye at such idle pains to spread your fame over so many peoples?
"Though it should happen that the uttermost nations Edition: current; Page: [48]P. 48. were to exalt your name, and praise you in many a tongue, and though a man were to wax great from his noble birth, and prosper in all wealth and all splendour, yet Death recketh not for these things."
"He giveth no heed to high birth, but swalloweth up mighty and lowly alike, and so bringeth both great and small to one level."
"Where now are the bones of the famous and wise goldsmith, Weland?"
"I call him wise, for the man of skill can never lose his cunning, and can no more be deprived of it than the sun may be moved from his station."
"Where are now Weland’s bones, or who knoweth now where they are?"
"Where now is the famous and the bold Roman chief [consul] that was called Brutus, and by his other name Cassius, or the wise and steadfast Cato, that was also a Roman leader, and well known as a sage?"
"Did they not die long ago, and not a man now knoweth where they are?"
"What is there left of them but a meagre fame, and a name writ with a few letters?"
"And worse still, we know of many famous men, and worthy of remembrance, now dead, of whom but few have any knowledge."
"Many lie dead and utterly forgotten, so that even fame is not able to make them known."
"Though ye now hope for and desire long life here in this world, how are ye the better for it?"
"For doth not Death come, though he come late, and doth he not put you out of this world?"
"What availeth you then your vainglory, you at least whom the second death shall seize, and hold fast for ever?’

WHEN she had sung this song, Philosophy began to discourse and spake thus: ‘Do not think that I am too stubborn in my fight against Fate; I fear her not myself, for often it happens that deceitful Fate can neither help nor harm a man."
"She deserveth no praise, seeing that she herself declares her own nothingness, and in making known her ways she bewrayeth her source."
"Yet I think thou dost not yet understand what I am saying to thee, for that which I am about to tell thee is so wonderful, that I can hardly set it forth in words as I would."
Know that to every man Adversity is more profitable than Prosperity.
"For Prosperity is ever false and deludeth men to believe that she is true happiness; but Adversity is the real happiness, though we may not think so; for she is steadfast, and her promises always come true."
"Prosperity is false, and betrays all her friends, for by her changefulness she shows forth her fickleness, but Adversity betters and teaches all those to whom she joins herself."
"Again, Prosperity takes captive the minds of all them that enjoy her with her cozening pretence that she is good, while Adversity unbinds and sets free all those who are subject to her, by revealing to them how perishable this present happiness is."
"Prosperity rusheth along in gusts like the wind, but Adversity is ever sober and wary, braced by the prompting of her own peril."
"By her flattery False Happiness in the end irresistibly Edition: current; Page: [50]leadeth them that consort with her away from true happiness, but Adversity as often forcibly leadeth all them that are subject to her to true happiness, even as the fish is taken by the hook."
"Does this then seem to thee a poor possession and a slight increase of thine happiness, this advantage that grim and awful Adversity bringeth thee, in readily laying bare the minds of thy true friends and also of thy foes, so that thou canst clearly know them apart?"
"But this False Happiness, when she forsakes thee, takes away her followers with her, and leaves thy few trusty friends with thee."
What wouldst thou give to be supremely happy and to know that Fate went wholly at thy will?
And how much money wouldst give to be able to clearly know friend from foe?
"Why, I know well thou wouldst give ever so much to be able to distinguish them."
"Though thou thinkest thyself to have lost things of great price, thou hast bought a thing of more worth, that is, true friends; these thou canst recognize, and their numbers thou knowest."
"Surely that is the most precious of all possessions.’

P. 50."
"WHEN Philosophy had finished this discourse, she began to chaunt, and in her singing said: ‘One Creator there is without any doubt, and He is the ruler of heaven and earth and of all creatures, visible and invisible, even God almighty."
"Him serve all things that serve, they that know Him and they that know Him not, they thatEdition: current; Page: [51]P. 51.know they are serving Him and they that know it not."
"He hath established unchanging habits and natures, and likewise natural concord among all His creatures, even as He hath willed, and for as long as He hath willed; and they shall remain for ever."
"The motions of the moving bodies cannot be stayed nor turned aside from their course and their appointed order, but the Lord hath so caught and led, and managed all His creatures with His bridle, that they can neither cease from motion, nor yet move more swiftly than the length of His rein alloweth them."
"Almighty God hath so constrained all His creatures with His power, that each of them is in conflict with the other, and yet upholdeth the other, so that they may not break away but are brought round to the old course, and start afresh."
"Such is their variation that opposites, while conflicting among themselves, yet preserve unbroken harmony together."
"Thus do fire and water behave, the sea and the earth, and many other creatures that are as much at variance as they are; but yet in their variance they can not only be in fellowship, but still more, one cannot exist without the other, and ever one contrary maketh the due measure of the other."
So also cunningly and befittingly hath Almighty God established the law of change for all His creatures.
"Consider springtime and autumn; in spring things grow, in autumn they wither away."
"Again, take summer and winter; in summer it is warm, in winter cold."
"So also the sun bringeth bright days, and at night the moon shineth, by the might of the same God.Edition: current; Page: [52]He forbiddeth the sea to overstep the threshold of the earth, having fixed their boundaries in such wise that the sea may not broaden her border over the motionless earth."
By the same order the alternation of the flow and ebb is ruled.
"These ordinances God suffereth to stand as long as He willeth, but whenever He shall loose the bridle-rein wherewith He hath bridled His creatures (that is, the law of contraries we have mentioned), and let them fall asunder, they shall leave their present harmony, and, striving together each according to his own will, abandon their fellowship, and destroy all this world, and themselves be brought to nought."
"The same God uniteth people in friendship, and assembleth them in marriages of pure affection; He bringeth together friends and comrades so that they loyally observe concord and friendship."
"Oh, how blessed were mankind if their minds were as straight and as firmly based and ordered as the rest of creation is!’

Here endeth the second book of the Consolations of Boethius, and here beginneth the third.Boethius was called by a second name Severinus, and was a Roman leader or consul."

WHEN Philosophy had sung this lay, she had so captivated me with the delightfulness of her song, that I was in an admiration, and very eager to hear her with all my heart; and very soon after I called to her and spake thus: Edition: current; Page: [53]‘O Philosophy, that art the highest comfort of all weary souls, how thou hast comforted me with thy acute discourse and thy delightful singing!"
"Thou hast so cheered and convinced me with thy wisdom that I think I can not only bear this misfortune that hath come upon me, but, even if yet graver peril befell me, I should never again say that it was undeserved; for I know that I deserve even greater and heavier sorrows."
But I would hear somewhat more concerning the medicine of thy doctrine.
"For though thou saidst a little while ago that it would seem exceeding bitter to me, as thou didst think, yet I do not now fear it, but am very eager both to hear it and to have it; therefore I beg thee very earnestly to fulfil the promise thou madest to me just now.’

Then said Philosophy, ‘I quickly perceived, when thou didst hold thy peace and didst hearken with such pleasure to my teaching, that thou wast ready to grasp it and ponder it with thine inward mind."
"Therefore I waited till I was certain of what thou didst desire, and how thou wouldst understand it, and I strove very earnestly to make thee apprehend it."
But now I will tell thee of what nature is the medicine of my doctrine that thou dost ask me for.
"It is very bitter in the mouth, and makes the throat smart when thou first dost taste it, but it grows sweet when it is swallowed, and is very soothing in the stomach, and returns a very sweet savour."
"If thou knewest whither I now mean to take thee, doubtless thou wouldst hasten thither eagerly and wouldst be mightily inflamed with desire Edition: current; Page: [54]for it, for I heard thee say before how eager thou wast to hear it.’

M. Whither wilt thou now lead me?"
"P. I mean to lead thee to True Happiness, whereof thou dost often conjecture and dream; but as yet thou canst not find the right way to it, being yet mazed with the outward show of False Happiness."
M. I pray thee to show me beyond all doubt what True Happiness is.
"P. I will gladly do so for love of thee; but I must show thee some analogy by way of example until the matter becomes more familiar to thee, so that, having clearly apprehended the example, thou mayest by the analogy arrive at an understanding of True Happiness, and forsake what is contrary to it, namely False Happiness, and then with thy whole soul strive earnestly to attain to the happiness that endureth for ever."
"XXIII

WHEN Philosophy had uttered this discourse she began to chaunt again, and spake thus: ‘Whoever would sow fertile land, must first pluck up the thorns, and furze, and fern, and all the weeds that he seeth infesting the field, so that the wheat may grow the better."
Consider also another example: everybody thinketh honeycomb the sweeter if he a little before taste something bitter.
"Again, calm weather is often the more grateful, if shortly before there have been violent storms and the north wind withEdition: current; Page: [55]great rains and snows."
"And the light of day likewise is more grateful by reason of the dreadful darkness of the night, than it would be if there were no night."
"So also is True Happiness far more delightful to possess after the miseries of this present life, and thou mayest far more easily understand this True Happiness, and attain to it, if thou first pluck up and utterly remove from thy mind False Happiness."
"Once thou canst get to know the true one, I know thou wilt desire nought else before it.’

XXIV

AFTER she had sung this song Philosophy stopped singing and was silent awhile, and after musing deeply in her mind said: ‘Every mortal man afflicts himself with many and various cares, and nevertheless all desire to come by diverse paths to one end; that is, they desire by diverse deserts to reach one happiness."
"Now this is no other than God, who is the beginning and end of every good thing, and He is the Highest Happiness.’

‘Then,’ said Mind, ‘this seems to me the Supreme good, that man should neither heed nor care about any other good when he hath that which is the roof of all good things; for it encompasses them all round about, and contains them."
"It would not be the Supreme Good if there existed any outside it, for it would then be apt to desire some good not in its own possession.’

Then Philosophy answered and said, ‘It is quite Edition: current; Page: [56]clear that this is the Highest Happiness, for it is both roof and floor of all good."
"What can that be but the Highest Happiness, that hath in itself all other kinds of happiness; and from which, itself lacking or needing nothing, they all proceed, and to which they return, as all water proceeds from and returns to the sea?"
"No brook is too small to seek the sea; afterwards it passeth from the sea into the earth, and so it goeth winding through the earth till it cometh again to the same spring from which it flowed at first, and so again to the sea."
"Now this is a similitude of True Happiness, which all mortal men desire to get, though they think to come at it by various ways."
"For each man hath a natural good in himself, and each mind desires to acquire true good, but is hindered by these fleeting joys because it is more prone thereto."
"For some men think that the greatest happiness is for a man to be so rich as to need nothing more, and all their life long they yearn after this."
"Some think that the highest good is to be the most honoured by their fellows, and they strive thereafter with might and main."
"Others think it lies in sovereign power, and desire either themselves to rule or to attach to themselves the friendship of the powerful."
"Again, some are persuaded that the best thing is to be famous and widely known, and to have a good name, and they labour thereafter both in peace and in war."
"Many men account it the greatest good and the greatest happiness to be always merry in this present life, and to satisfy every desire."
"Some, when they seek wealth, seek it to Edition: current; Page: [57]get more power by it, so that they may with impunity enjoy these worldly pleasures and riches."
"Many again desire power to enable them to amass enormous wealth, or from a wish to spread abroad their name and fame."
"Such among others are the frail and corruptible honours that afflict the soul of man with yearning and ambition; he thinks he has acquired some notable good when he has received the flattery of the crowd, but I think he has purchased a very false distinction."
"Some men desire wives most earnestly, for the begetting of many children, and also for a pleasant life."
"Now I assert that the most precious of all this world’s blessings is True Friendship, which must be accounted not a worldly good, but a heavenly blessing; for it is not false Fate that produces it, but God, who createa natural friends in kinsmen."
"For every other thing in this world man desireth either because it will help him to power, or to get some pleasure, save only a true friend; him we love for love’s sake and for our trust in him, though we can hope for no other return from him."
Nature joins friends together and unites them with a very inseparable love; but by means of these worldly goods and the wealth of this life we oftener make foes than friends.
By these and many other reasons all men may be shown that all bodily excellencies are inferior to the qualities of the soul.
"For instance, we think a man is strong in proportion to the bulk of his body; and a comely and active body gives satisfaction and cheerfulness to its possessor, aud good health makes him merry."
"Now in all these Edition: current; Page: [58]bodily enjoyments men seek simple happiness as it seems to them, for every man accounts that the best and highest good for him which he loves above all things, and thinks he shall be truly happy when he shall have attained it."
"And yet I do not deny that happiness and prosperity are the highest blessings of this life of ours, for the reason just given; and when a man is convinced that the possession of a thing will bring him great happiness, then he desires it most."
"Is not this semblance of false happiness clearly revealed, namely possessions, honours, power, and vain glory, and carnal pleasure?"
"Speaking of carnal pleasure, Epicurus the philosopher, when investigating all the various kinds of happiness we have spoken about, said that pleasure is the highest good, for all the forms of happiness we have spoken of flatter and encourage the mind."
"Pleasure, however, alone flatters the body most exclusively."
‘Let us talk yet further on the nature of men and their strivings.
"Though their minds and natures be obscured, and they be hastening on the downward course to evil, yet they desire the highest good, as far as their knowledge and power go."
"Even as a drunken man knoweth that he should go to his home and his rest, but cannot find the way thither, so it is with the mind when it is weighed down with the cares of this world, for drugged and led astray therewith it cannot find the direct road to what is good."
"Nor do men think that they at all err that desire to get hold of so much that they need not strive after more; but they believe Edition: current; Page: [59]they can gather together all these blessings, so that not one thereof be lacking, knowing no higher good than to get together into their own power the most valuable things, and thereby satisfy every need."
"But God only is without need, not man; God, being self-sufficing, needeth nothing besides what He hath in Himself."
Dost thou then account those foolish who think that thing deserving of most honour which they judge to be most perfect?
"No, surely not, I think that this is not to be despised."
"How can that be evil which the mind of every man thinketh good, and striveth after, and desireth to possess?"
"No, it is not evil, but the highest good."
Why then is not power to be accounted one of the highest blessings of this life?
"Is power, the most valuable of all worldly possessions, to be reckoned a feeble and useless thing?"
Are good report and fame to be accounted nothing?
"No, no, it is wrong to count these things as naught, for every man thinketh his own object of desire the best."
"But we know, of course, that no poverty, nor hardship, nor sorrow, nor grief, nor melancholy, can be happiness."
"Why, then, need we talk about happiness any further?"
"Doth not every man know what it is, and know too that it is the Highest Good?"
"and yet nearly every one seeks the highest happiness in very trifling things, thinking it his, if he hath obtained that which he craveth most at the time."
"Now these eager cravings are for wealth, honours, authority, worldly splendour, vain glory, and carnal pleasures."
"All these do men desire, for by their means they hope to attain to a state when they shall Edition: current; Page: [60]be lacking in no desire, neither in honour nor power nor fame nor pleasure."
"And their desires, though so various, are reasonable."
"By these examples a man may see clearly that every one desires to compass the highest good wherever he may recognize it and wherever he may know how to seek it aright; but he seeketh it not by the straightest path, for that lieth not in this world.’

WHEN Philosophy had spoken this discourse she began once more to sing, and her words were on this wise: ‘Now will I with song declare how wondrously the Lord guideth all His creatures with the bridle of His power, with what order He hath established and controlleth all creatures, and how He hath bound them and fastened them in bonds unbreakable, so that each created thing is held fast locked to its kind, even that to which it was created; yea, everything save man and certain angels—these at times leave their kind."
"Lo, the lion, even if he be quite tame and firmly fettered, and very fond moreover and also afraid of his master, yet let him once happen to taste blood, and straightway he forgetteth his recent tameness, and remembereth the wild habits of his fathers."
"He beginneth to roar, and to break his bonds asunder; first he rendeth his master, then everything whatsoever he may get hold Edition: current; Page: [61]of, whether man or beast."
"So with wild birds of the forest; they may be thoroughly tamed, yet once they find themselves in the greenwood, they set at naught their teachers, and live after their kind."
"Though their teachers offer them the food wherewith they tamed them once, they heed it not, if only they may have the woods to enjoy; far pleasanter is it, they think, to hear other birds singing, and the forest’s answering echoes."
"Again, it is in the nature of trees to rear themselves aloft; though thou draw down to earth a branch as far as thou hast power to bend it, even as thou lettest it go it will spring up and hasten to its natural state."
"The sun too doth so; though he sink after midday lower and lower earthwards, yet again he seeketh his natural course and wendeth by hidden ways towards his rising; then mounteth he high and ever higher, as far as is his nature to soar."
"And so each creature doth; it hasteneth towards its natural state, and is glad if it may reach this."
"Not one creature is there that doth not wish to reach the place wherefrom it started, where it findeth rest, and naught to trouble."
"Now that rest is in God, nay, it is God."
"But each creature turneth round on itself, as a wheel doth, and turneth in such a way as to come back to its starting point, and to be once more that which it before was, as soon as it hath returned to where it was, and to do again what it did before.’

WHEN Philosophy had sung this song she began to discourse again and said, ‘O ye men of this world, though ye act like the beasts in your folly, yet ye can perceive something, as in a dream, of your original, that is, of God."
"Ye perceive that there is a true beginning and a true end of all happiness, though ye understand it not fully; ye are led by your nature towards understanding, but are drawn away from it by manifold error."
"Bethink yourselves whether men can come to true happiness by their present joys, since nearly all men regard him as the most blest who has all earthly happiness."
Can great possessions or honours or all this wealth of the moment make any man so happy as to need nothing more?
Certainly I know they cannot.
"Then is it not manifest that this present good is not the true good, seeing it cannot give what it promises?"
"For it speciously offers to do what it is unable to fulfil, promising those who incline their ear unto it true happiness, and more often than not disappointing them, for it hath no more happiness to bestow than the others have."
"Now take thine own case, Boethius: wast thou never sad in the height of thy prosperity, or didst thou never lack aught when possessed of most wealth?"
"or again, was thy life in all respects according to thy desire?’

B."
"No indeed, I was never so evenly poised in mind, as far as I remember, as to be entirely free from Edition: current; Page: [63]care and perplexity, and I never yet liked everything, nor had all I wished, though I concealed the fact."
"P. Wast thou not then miserable and unhappy enough, though conceiting thyself wealthy, when thou either hadst what thou didst dislike, or didst lack what thou desiredst?"
B.
All was with me as thou sayest.
"P. Is not then a man miserable, when he hath not that which he fain would have?"
B.
That is true.
"P. If then he is miserable he is not content, desiring what he hath not in order to satisfy himself."
B.
All thou sayest is true.
"P. Well then, wast thou not also miserable in the midst of thy plenty?"
"Then I answered and said, ‘I know thou speakest truth."
"I was indeed miserable.’

P. I cannot help thinking then that all the riches of the world are not able to make one single man so rich as to have enough and need no more; and yet this is what wealth promises to all who possess it."
"‘Nothing,’ said I, ‘is truer than what thou art saying.’

P. Why, of course thou must admit it?"
Dost thou not every day see the strong robbing the goods of the weak?
"What else causes every day such lamentation and such strife, and lawsuits, and sentences, but the fact that each claims the property plundered from him, or else covets that of another?"
B.
"A fair question, and what thou sayest is true."
"Edition: current; Page: [64]

P. For this cause every man needeth support from without to make himself stronger, that he may preserve his wealth."
B.
Who can deny it?
"P. If he had no fear of losing any of his possessions, he would have no need of outside help."
B. Thou speakest true.
"Then Philosophy made protest sorrowfully and said, ‘Alas!"
"how contrary to every man’s wont and every man’s desires is what I shall now say to thee, to wit that their fancied source of riches maketh them poorer and more cowardly!"
"For when a man has a little he feels he needs to court the protection of such as possess somewhat more, and, whether he need it or no, he sets his mind on it."
Where then is moderation to be found?
who possesses it?
"when will it appear and utterly banish poverty from the wealthy man, who, the more he has, the more he feels himself bound to court the crowd?"
"Can a rich man never feel hunger, nor thirst, nor cold?"
"I think however thou wilt urge that the rich have the means to amend all that, but, though thou urge this, wealth cannot always do this, though it is sometimes able to do so."
"For they must be able daily to replace their daily loss, human wants being insatiable, and craving every day somewhat of worldly gear, such as clothing, food, drink, and many other things besides; wherefore no man is so well furnished as to want nothing more."
"But covetousness knoweth no bounds, and is never content with bare necessity, but ever desireth too much."
"It passes my Edition: current; Page: [65]understanding why ye men put your trust in perishable wealth, seeing it cannot free you from poverty; nay, ye thereby only increase it.’

When Philosophy had uttered this discourse she began to chaunt again and singing to say: ‘What profiteth it the wealthy miser to amass countless riches and to gather store enough of all precious stones, and though he till his fields with a thousand ploughs, and all this earth be his to govern?"
"For he cannot take with him from this earth anything more than he brought hither.’

XXVII

WHEN Philosophy had sung through this song, she began to discourse again and said: ‘Two things can honour and power do, if they fall into the hands of a fool; they can make him respected and revered by other fools."
"But as soon as he quits his power, or his power forsakes him, he has no respect nor reverence from them."
"Has power therefore the faculty of rooting up and plucking out vices from the minds of its possessors, and planting in their stead virtues?"
"I know that earthly power doth never sow virtues, but gathereth and harvesteth vices; and, when it hath gathered them in, it maketh a show of them instead of covering them up, for the vices of the great, who know and associate with many men, are beheld of the multitude."
"Thus, then, we lament over power when lost, and at the same time despise it, seeing Edition: current; Page: [66]P. 66. how it cometh to the worst of men, and those we think the most unworthy."
"Hence the wise Catulus long ago waxed wroth and heaped insult and contumely on the rich Nonius, because he met him seated in a gorgeous carriage; for it was a strict custom among the Romans at that time that only the worthiest should sit in such carriages."
"Catulus despised the man seated there, whom he knew to be very ignorant and very dissolute; so without more ado he spat upon him."
"This Catulus was a Roman leader [consul] and a man of great understanding, and he would certainly not have done such great despite to the other, had the latter not been rich and powerful."
"‘Canst thou conceive what dishonour power brings upon him that receives it, if he be imperfect, every man’s vices showing the plainer if he hath authority?"
"Tell me now, I ask thee, Boethius, how it came to pass that thou didst suffer so many evils and such great discomforts when thou hadst power, and why thou didst afterwards abandon it so unwillingly?"
"Why, was it not simply because thou wouldst not in all things fall in with the will of the unrighteous king Theodoric, perceiving him to be in all respects unworthy of power, shameless and turbulent, and without any good parts?"
"Wherefore we cannot lightly say that evil men are good, even though possessed of authority."
"Nevertheless thou wouldst not have been banished by Theodoric, nor would he have been displeased with thee, if like his foolish favourites thou hadst shown liking for his folly and unrighteousness."
"Now, if thou wert to see a very Edition: current; Page: [67]wise man that had much noble pride, but yet was very poor and very unfortunate, wouldst thou say that he was unworthy of power and honours?"
B.
"No, indeed; if I met such a man I would never say that he was unworthy of power and honours; nay, I should consider him worthy of any honour the world may have."
"P. Every virtue hath her own special grace; and this grace, and the honour of it, she bestoweth speedily on him that cherishes her."
"For example, Wisdom, which is the loftiest of virtues, hath within herself four other virtues, to wit, prudence, temperance, courage, justice."
"She maketh her lovers wise and worthy, sober, patient, and just, and filleth him that loveth her with every good gift."
"This they that possess authority in this world cannot do, for they can from their wealth bestow not a single virtue upon their lovers, if these already naturally have none."
"Hence it is very clear that the powerful man hath no special virtue in his possessions; they come to him from without, and he cannot possess aught that is outside him as his own."
"Just consider whether any man is the more unworthy merely because many men despise him; nay, if any man be the more unworthy, it must be the fool who to wise men appeareth the unworthier the more he hath."
"It is therefore clear enough that authority and riches cannot make their possessor any the more worthy, but rather make him the less worthy, if he were not already good."
"So too power and wealth are worse if their possessor be not a good man, and either of them is the Edition: current; Page: [68]baser when they are together."
"However, I can easily prove to thee by an example, and thou shalt clearly understand, that this present life is like unto a shadow, wherein no man can attain to true happiness."
"If a very mighty man were to be banished from his own land, or sent on his lord’s errand, and came to a foreign country where he was quite unknown and unknowing, and whose language was entirely strange to him, thinkest thou that his power at home would make him honourable there?"
I know that it could not.
"If honours belonged naturally to wealth, or if wealth were really possessed by the wealthy man, they would not forsake him, but would accompany him, in whatever country he happened to be."
"But as they do not really belong to him they desert him, and because they are not in their nature good they vanish like a shadow or smoke."
"Though their false hope and imagination lead fools to believe that power and wealth are the highest good, yet it is quite otherwise."
"When a man of great wealth happens to be either in a foreign land or among the wise men of his own country, his wealth counts for nothing, for then men perceive that they owe their distinction not to any virtue of their own but to the applause of the silly people."
"If then they derived any special or natural good from their power, they would keep this good, even though they lost their power, and instead of forsaking them this natural good would ever cleave unto them and make them respected in whatever land they were."
Now thou mayst understand that wealth and power Edition: current; Page: [69]P. 69. cannot make a man esteemed in a foreign land.
"Thou thinkest perhaps that in their own country they may be always able to do so, but I know that they cannot."
"Many years ago throughout the Roman realm the leaders, and judges, and treasurers that had the keeping of the money paid yearly to the soldiers, and the wisest counsellors, had the highest honours; but in these days either there are none such, or, if there be, they are held in no honour."
"So it is with all things that have in themselves no proper natural good; sometimes they are blameworthy, at others to be praised."
"What pleasure or profit, thinkest thou, are in wealth and power, that are never content, nor have any good in themselves, nor can give to their possessors any lasting advantage?"
"XXVIII

WHEN she had spoken thus Philosophy began to chaunt again, and sang thus: ‘Though the unrighteous king Nero arrayed himself in all the most splendid raiment, and adorned himself with all manner of gems, was he not hateful and contemptible to every wise man, being full of all vice and foul sin?"
"Yea, he honoured his darlings with great wealth; but what were they the better therefor?"
"What wise man could say he was the more honourable for the honours granted him?’

Edition: current; Page: [70]

XXIX

WHEN Philosophy had sung this lay, then she began to discourse again, and spake thus: ‘Dost thou think that companionship of a king and the wealth and power he bestows on his darlings can make a man really wealthy or powerful?’

Then I answered, saying, ‘Why can they not?"
"For what is more pleasant and better in this life than the service and neighbourhood of a king, as well as wealth and power?’

P. Tell me, then, whether thou hast ever heard of these things abiding with any of our predecessors, or dost thou think any man who has them now will be able to retain them for ever?"
"Thou knowest that all books are full of examples taken from the lives of the men that were before our time, and every man now living is aware that many a king has lost his power and riches and become poor again."
Well-a-day!
"A fine thing forsooth is wealth, that can preserve neither itself nor its lord, nor ensure the latter from needing further help, nor both from despiteful usage!"
Is not kingly power your very highest form of happiness?
"And yet, if a king lacks aught that he desires, his power is thereby lessened and his poverty made greater, for your blessings are always lacking in some respect or other."
"Yea, kings may rule over many peoples, yet they do not rule all those that they would wish to rule, but are miserable in their mind because they cannot come by Edition: current; Page: [71]P. 71. all they would have; and a king who is greedy has, I know, more poverty than power."
"It was for this that a king who in old times unjustly seized the kingdom said, ‘Oh, how happy the man over whose head no naked sword hangs by a fine thread, as it has ever been hanging over mine!’ How thinkest thou?"
"How do wealth and power please thee, seeing they never exist without dread and misery and sorrow?"
"Lo, thou knowest that every king would be quit of these and yet hold power if he could, but I know he cannot; so that I marvel why they glory in such power."
Does then he seem to thee to have great power and much happiness that is ever desiring what he can never compass?
"Or again, dost thou think him very happy that ever goes forth with a great bodyguard, or again him that stands in dread alike of those that fear him and those that fear him not?"
"Dost thou think him to have much power, who, as many do, fancies he has none unless he have many to do his bidding?"
"What shall we now say more of kings and of their courtiers save this, that every wise man will perceive they are poor and very weak creatures?"
"How can kings deny or conceal their weakness, when they can accomplish no great deed without the help of their servants?"
"Or what more shall we say regarding kings’ servants, but that it often happens that they are stripped of all their honours, nay, even of life itself, by their false monarch?"
"Do we not know that the wicked king Nero was willing to order his own teacher and foster-father, whose name was Seneca, a philosopher, to Edition: current; Page: [72]be put to death?"
"And when this man found that he must die he offered all his possessions for his life, but the king would none of them, nor grant him his life."
Perceiving this he chose to die by being let blood in the arm; and so it was done.
"Again, we have heard how Papinianus was the best-loved of all the favourites of the Caesar Antonius, and how he had most power of all his people; but the Caesar had him cast in bonds and then put to death."
"Now all men know that Seneca was held in most honour and most love by Nero, as was Papinianus by Antonius, and they were most powerful both within the court and without; and yet, though void of offence, they were done to death."
"Both desired their lords to take all they had, and let them live, but could not prevail, for the cruelty of those kings was so harsh that the humility of the men availed them no more than their pride had done before; all was in vain; do what they would, they had to forfeit their lives."
For he that doth not take care in time will have no provision when his hour cometh.
"How do power or wealth please thee now that thou hast heard that no man can possess them and be free from dread, nor give them up if he so desire?"
"What availed the kings’ darlings their multitude of friends, or what avail they any man?"
"For friends come in with riches, and depart again with them, save very few."
"And the friends that love him for wealth’s sake depart when wealth departs, and then become his enemies, except those few who formerly loved him out of love and loyalty."
These would have loved him even if he Edition: current; Page: [73]had been poor; these also abide with him.
"What is worse plague and greater hurt to any man than to have in his company and neighbourhood a foe in the likeness of a friend?’

When Philosophy had spoken this speech she began to sing again, and these were her words:

‘He who would have full power must first strive to get power over his own mind, and not be unduly subject to his vices, and he must put away from him undue cares, and cease to bewail his misery."
"Though he rule the earth from east to west, that is, from India to the south-east of the earth, even to the island we call Thule (that is to the north-west of this earth, where in summer there is no night, and in winter no day), yet hath he none the more power if he have no power over his own thoughts, and be not on his guard against those vices we have before spoken of.’

XXX

P. 73."
"WHEN Philosophy had sung this stave she began again to make a discourse, and said: ‘Very unseemly and very false is the glory of this world; and of this a poet once sang, and in his contempt for this present life said, “O worldly glory, why do foolish men falsely call thee glory, when such thou art not?” For men’s great fame and glory and honour are owing more to the belief of the foolish crowd than to their Edition: current; Page: [74]own deserving."
"Now tell me, what can be more perverse than this, and why are not men rather ashamed than glad of such things when they hear men speaking falsely about them?"
"Though a good man be rightly praised, and truly spoken of, yet he must not for all that rejoice too unboundedly in what the people say of him; still, he may be glad that they speak the truth of him."
"Though he may rejoice in that they spread his fame, yet is it not so widely spread as he supposes, for they cannot spread it far and wide over the whole earth, though they may over certain countries."
"For though he be praised by some men, yet he will be without praise among others; though in one land famous, he will not be famous in another."
"Therefore is the applause of the people to be held as nothing, since it comes not to every man by his deserving, nor yet remains with him always."
"Again, consider first as to high birth: if a man boast thereof, what a vain and unprofitable thing his boast is, for every one knows that all men are come of one father and one mother."
"Or again, as to people’s applause and praise: I do not know why we take pleasure in it."
"Though they be famous whom the people praise, yet are they more famous and more rightly praised that are made honourable by virtues, for no man is by right the more famous and praiseworthy by reason of another’s goodness and virtues, if he himself possess them not."
Art thou the fairer for another’s fair looks?
"A man is very little the better for having a good father, if he himself have Edition: current; Page: [75]nothing in him."
"Wherefore my teaching is that thou shouldst rejoice in the goodness and high heritage of other men so far as not to take it for thine own, for a man’s goodness and high heritage are rather of the mind than of the flesh."
"The only good I know in being highly born is that many a man is ashamed to become worse than his elders were, and therefore endeavours with all his might to attain to the gifts and virtues of one among the best of them.’

When Philosophy had finished this speech she began to sing concerning the same matters, and said: ‘Lo!"
"all men had the like beginning, coming from one father and one mother, and they are still brought forth alike."
"This is not wonderful, for one God is the Father of all creatures; He made them and ruleth them all."
"He giveth the sun his light, and to the moon hers, and ordereth all the stars."
"He created men on earth, bringing souls and bodies together in His might, and in the beginning created all men of like birth."
"Why then do ye men pride yourselves above others without cause for your high birth, seeing ye can find no man but is high-born, and all men are of like birth, if ye will but bethink you of their beginning and their Creator, and also the manner of birth of each among you?"
"Now true high birth is of the mind, not of the flesh, as we have said before, and every man that is utterly given over to vices forsaketh his Creator, and his origin, and his noble birth, and then loseth rank till he be of low degree.’

Edition: current; Page: [76]

XXXI

P. 76."
"WHEN Philosophy had sung this lay she began to discourse again, and spake thus: ‘What good can we say of fleshly vices?"
"For whosoever will forsake them must suffer great privation and many afflictions; for superfluity ever nourishes vices, and vices have great need of repentance, and there is no repentance without sorrow and privation."
"Alas, how many sicknesses and sorrows, and what heavy vigils and what great miseries, are his whose desires are evil in this world!"
"And how many more evils, thinkest thou, will he have after this life as the reward of his misdeeds?"
"Even so a woman in travail bringeth forth a child and suffereth great pains, according as she hath formerly enjoyed great delight."
I cannot therefore understand what joy worldly pleasures bring to those that love them.
"If now it be said that he is happy that fulfils all his worldly lusts, why may it not also be said that beasts are happy, whose will is enslaved by nothing else but greed and lust?"
"Very pleasant is it for a man to have wife and children, and yet many children are begotten to their parents’ destruction, for many a woman dies in childbirth before she can bear the child; and moreover we have learned that long ago there happened a most unwonted and unnatural evil, to wit that sons conspired together and plotted against their father."
"Nay, worse still, we have heard in old story how of yore a certain son slew his father;Edition: current; Page: [77]I know not in what way, but we know that it was an inhuman deed."
"Lo, also, every one knows what heavy sorrow falls to a man in the care of his children; indeed, I need not tell thee this, for thou hast found it out for thyself."
"My master Euripides says, concerning the heavy care that children are, that often it were better for an unhappy father never to have had children at all.’

When Philosophy had finished this discourse she began to chaunt again, and thus spake in her song: ‘Lo!"
the evil desire of unlawful lust disturbeth the mind of well-nigh every man that liveth.
"Even as the bee must die when she stingeth in her anger, so must every soul perish after unlawful lust, except a man return to virtue.’

XXXII

WHEN Philosophy had sung this lay, she began to discourse again, and spake thus."
"‘Wherefore there is no doubt that this present wealth hinders and hampers those men that be drawn towards true happiness, and is unable to make good its promise, namely, to bring them to the highest good."
But in a few words I could tell thee with how many evils these riches are filled.
"What dost thou then mean by coveting money, when thou canst in no way else compass it save by stealing and plundering or begging it, and when one man cannot add to his store of it without another’s store being lessened?"
"Edition: current; Page: [78]Then again thou wouldst be high in repute, but to have that thou must with pitiful and humble mien court him that can help thee thereto."
"If thou wouldst make thee better and more valued than many, then must thou hold thyself of less account than one."
Is it not a part of misery to have to fawn so abjectly on the man who has a gift to bestow?
Dost thou crave power?
"But power without care thou canst not have, not only by reason of strangers, but yet more for thine own people and kinsmen."
Dost thou yearn for vain glory?
"But glory free from care thou canst not have, for thou shalt ever have something to thwart thee and put thee out."
Wouldst thou enjoy over-much carnal pleasure?
"But God’s good ministers will then forsake thee, for thy worthless flesh is thy lord, and not thy servant."
How can a man demean himself more pitiably than to make himself the thrall of his poor paltry flesh and not of his reasonable soul?
"Though thou wert greater than the elephant, or stronger than the lion or bull, or swifter than the beast we call tiger, and of all men fairest to behold, yet if thou wouldst earnestly seek after wisdom until thou didst attain a perfect understanding thereof, then mightest thou plainly perceive that all the powers and qualities we have spoken of are not to be compared with one single quality of the soul."
"For instance, Wisdom is but a single quality of the soul, and yet we all know that it is better than all the other qualities we have mentioned."
"‘Behold the broad compass, the stability, and the swiftness of yonder heavens; and then ye will be able Edition: current; Page: [79]to understand that they are nothing whatever when compared with their Creator and Ruler."
"Why then do ye not grow tired of admiring and praising what is of less account, namely, these earthly riches?"
"As the heavens are better and loftier and fairer than all they contain, save only man, even so is man’s body better and more precious than all his possessions."
"But how much better and more precious, thinkest thou, is the soul than the body?"
"Every creature is to be honoured in its due degree, and the highest is ever to be honoured most; therefore the divine power should be honoured and admired and esteemed above all other things."
"Bodily beauty is very fleeting and very fragile, most like the flowers of the earth."
"A man might be as beautiful as Prince Alcibiades was; but if another were so keen of sight as to be able to see through him (Aristotle the philosopher said there was a beast that could see through everything, trees, yea, even stones; this beast we call the lynx)—if, I say, this man were so sharpsighted as to be able to see through the other we spoke of, he should think him by no means so fair inside as he seemed without."
"Thou mayest seem fair to men, but it is not any the truer for that; the dullness of their sight hinders them from perceiving that they see the outside of thee, not the inside."
"But consider right earnestly, ye men, and reflect discerningly upon the nature of these bodily advantages, and the joys ye now crave so unduly; then may ye get to know clearly that the body’s beauty and strength can be taken away by a three days’ fever."
"I am telling thee over again all Edition: current; Page: [80]I told thee before, because I wished to prove to thee plainly at the end of this chapter that all present blessings are unable to fulfil the promise they make to their lovers, I mean their promise of the highest good."
"They may gather together all blessings of the present, but none the more have they perfect good among their number, nor are they able to make their lovers as rich as these would fain be.’

When Philosophy had spoken this discourse, she began once more to sing, and these were the words of her song: ‘Ah me, how grievous and how harmful is the folly that deludeth poor mortals and leadeth them from the right way!"
The Way is God.
Do ye seek gold on trees?
"I know that ye neither seek it nor find it there, as all men know that it no more groweth there than gems grow in vineyards."
"Do ye set your net on the top of the hill, when ye would catch fish?"
I know ye do not set it there.
"Do ye then take your dogs and your nets out to sea, when ye would go hunting?"
"Ye place them, I ween, high up on the hills, and in the woods."
Truly it is wonderful how eager men know they must seek for white and red gems and precious stones of every kind by sea shore and by river strand; and they also know in what waters and at what river-mouths to look for fish.
"They know where to seek all this temporary wealth, and they pursue it untiringly."
"But it is a very lamentable thing that foolish men are so blind of judgment as not to know where true happiness is hid, no, nor even take any pleasure in the seeking of it."
"They think they can find among these fleeting Edition: current; Page: [81]and perishable things true happiness, which is God."
"I know not how to show their folly as clearly and blame it as strongly as I would, for they are more pitiful, more foolish, and more unhappy than I can well say."
"Wealth and honours are their desire, and when they have these they ignorantly fancy they have true happiness.’

XXXIII

WHEN Philosophy had sung this lay, she began again to discourse, and spake on this wise: ‘I have now said enough to thee concerning semblances and shadows of true happiness."
"But if thou art now able to discern the semblances of true happiness, then I must next show thee true happiness itself.’

Then I answered, saying, ‘Now I perceive quite clearly that there is no sufficiency of every good in these worldly riches, no perfect power in any worldly authority."
"True honour does not exist in this world, nor do the greatest of glories lie in this worldly glory, nor the highest joy in fleshly lusts.’

Then Philosophy made answer and said, ‘Dost thou then fully understand why it is so?’

‘I may,’ I answered, ‘understand somewhat of it, but nevertheless I would know it more fully and more plainly from thee.’

‘It is sufficiently evident,’ answered Philosophy, ‘that God is single and indivisible, though ignorant men divide Edition: current; Page: [82]Him into many parts, when they misguidedly seek the highest good in the baser creatures."
"Dost thou think he that has most power in this world has need of no more?’

Again I answered, saying, ‘I do not say he has no need of more, for I know that no man is so wealthy as not to need something to boot.’

‘Thou sayest quite rightly,’ answered Philosophy; ‘a man may have power, but if another has more, then the less strong needs the help of the stronger.’

‘It is all,’ I said, ‘as thou sayest.’

Then said Philosophy, ‘Though Power and Self-sufficiency are counted as two things, they are but one.’

M. I think so too."
"P. Dost thou think that Power and Self-sufficiency are to be despised, or to be honoured more than other advantages?"
M. No man may doubt that Power and Self-sufficiency are to be honoured.
"P. Let us then, if it so please thee, increase Power and Self-sufficiency by adding to them Honour, and then reckon the three as one."
"M. Let us do this, for it is the truth."
"P. Dost thou then deem wanting in honour and fame the union of the three qualities, when they are reckoned as one, or does it on the contrary seem to thee of all things most worthy of honour and fame?"
"If thou knewest any man with power over everything and having every honour to such a degree as to need Edition: current; Page: [83]none further, just bethink thee how honourable and glorious that man would seem to thee."
"And yet if he had the three qualities, but were not of good repute, he would be wanting honour in some measure."
M. I cannot deny this.
"P. Is it not then quite evident that we must add Good Repute to the three, and reckon the four as one?"
M. ’Tis the natural thing to do.
P. Dost thou think him at all merry who has all these four?
"Good Temper is the fifth, and then a man may do what he will, without needing anything more than he has."
"M. I cannot conceive, if he were like this and had all these things, whence any sorrow could reach him."
"P. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that the five things we spoke of, though kept apart in speech, are all one thing when united; to wit, Power, Self-sufficiency, Fame, Honour, Good Temper."
"These five, when all united, are God; wherefore no mortal man can possess all five in perfection while he is in this world."
"But when the five qualities (as we have before observed) are all joined together they make but one whole, and that whole is God; and He is single and indivisible, though before divided into many parts."
"Then I answered and said, ‘To all this I agree.’

Then said she, ‘Though God be single and indivisible (and He is so), yet human error divides Him with its idle words into many parts."
"Each man counts that his highest good which he loves most.Edition: current; Page: [84]Now one loves this, another loves something else; so that what a man most loves is his god."
"In dividing their god therefore into so many parts, they find neither God Himself nor that part of the Good which they love more."
When they make the Godhead into one separate whole they neither have Him altogether nor the part they have taken from Him.
"So no man finds what he seeks, for he seeks it in the wrong way."
"Ye seek what ye cannot find, when ye seek all that is Good in one form of Good.’

‘That is true,’ I said."
"Then said she, ‘When a man is poor he cares not for any power, but desires wealth and flees from poverty."
"He labours not to be first in fame, and that which a man does not toil after he does not compass."
"So all his life he toils after wealth, and lets go many a worldly desire, if he may get and keep wealth, for he craves it above all other things."
"When he does attain it he does not think he has enough unless he have power to boot, for without power he fancies he cannot keep his wealth."
"So too he is never content until he has all he desires, for wealth craves power, power honour, and honour glory."
"When he has his fill of wealth, he thinks he shall have every desire if he but possess power; and for power he gives away all his wealth, unless he can get it with less; and he forsakes every other kind of honour, so he may come to power."
"It often happens that when he has given all he owned in return for power he has neither the power nor what he gave for it, but is now so poor Edition: current; Page: [85]as not even to have the bare necessaries, that is, food and clothing."
"What he desires therefore is not power, but the necessaries of life."
"‘We were speaking of the five forms of happiness, Wealth, Power, Honour, Fame, and Desire."
"We have now discussed Wealth and Power, and we may treat in the same way of the three qualities we have not yet considered, Honour, Fame, and Desire."
"Respecting these three, and the two we mentioned before, though a man think he may enjoy perfect happiness with any one of them, it is not any the more true."
"Though men may desire it so, they must have all five.’

Then I answered, saying, ‘What are we to do then, since thou sayest we cannot have the Highest Good and Perfect Happiness with any one of these, and we have no hope that any one among us may compass all together?’

P. If any man desire to have all five, he desires the highest happiness; but he may not get them in perfection in this world, for though he were to obtain all five kinds of happiness, yet they, not being eternal, will not be the Highest Good nor the Best Happiness."
M. Now I understand quite clearly that the Best Happiness is not in this world.
P. No man in this present life need seek for True Happiness nor hope to find here a sufficiency of good.
M. Thou sayest truly.
"Then said she, ‘I think I have said enough to thee concerning False Happiness."
"I would now have thee turn thy thoughts from False Happiness, and then thou Edition: current; Page: [86]wilt perceive right soon the True Happiness I promised once to show thee.’

M. Why, even ignorant men understand that there is a Perfect Happiness, though it is not where they expect it to be."
A little while ago thou didst promise me to show me it.
"I believe, however, True and Perfect Happiness is that which is able to give to each of her followers abiding wealth, eternal power, perpetual honour, glory everlasting, and perfect independence."
"Yea further, I say that is True Happiness which can fully bestow one of these five; for in each one of them all reside."
"I tell thee this because I would have thee know that this principle is very firmly rooted in my mind, so firmly that no man can lead me away from it."
"P. Ah, my disciple, thou art happy indeed to have thus grasped it; but I would that we might further seek to know that thing in which thou art lacking."
"M. Why, what is that?"
P. Dost thou believe that any of these present blessings can bring thee perfect happiness?
"Thereupon I answered, saying, ‘I know of nothing in this present life that can bestow such a gift.’

P. These present blessings are the semblances of the Eternal Good, but are not Perfect Good, for they are unable to give true and perfect good to their followers."
M. I fully agree with what thou sayest.
"P. Since thou knowest what is False Happiness and what the True, I wish thee to learn how thou mayest attain to True Happiness."
"M. Thou didst promise me long ago, didst thou not, Edition: current; Page: [87]to teach it to me; and I would now right gladly hear it."
P. 87.P.
What then must we do to the end that we may reach true happiness?
"Shall we pray for divine help in less as well as in greater matters, even as our philosopher Plato has said?"
"M. I think we should pray to the Father of all things; for he that will not pray to Him findeth Him not, nor even taketh the right way to find Him."
"Then said she, ‘Thou art quite right,’ and thereupon she began to sing, and these were her words:

‘O Lord, how great and how wonderful Thou art, Thou that didst wonderfully fashion all Thy creatures, visible and invisible, and rulest them wisely."
"O Thou that hast appointed the seasons in due order from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, so that they fare forth and again return; Thou that wieldest according to Thy will all things that move, Thou dost Thyself abide ever still and unchanging."
"For none is mightier than Thou, none like unto Thee, nor did any necessity teach Thee to make that which Thou hast made, but by Thine own will and with Thine own power Thou hast made all things, needing none."
"Most wonderful is the nature of Thy goodness, for Thou and Thy goodness are one; not from without did it come to Thee; it is Thine own."
"But all the good that we have in this world came to us from without, even from Thee."
"No enmity hast Thou towards any thing, for none is more capable than Thou, none like unto Thee; all good things ThouEdition: current; Page: [88]didst plan and bring to pass, of Thy sole contriving."
"No man set Thee the example, for before Thee none was, either to do aught or to leave undone."
"But Thou hast made all very good and very fair, and Thou art Thyself the highest good and the fairest."
"Thou didst make this earth even as Thou didst Thyself plan it, and Thou rulest it as Thou wilt, and Thyself dost deal out all good even as Thou wilt."
"All creatures Thou hast made alike, and in some things also not alike."
"Though Thou hast given one name to all creatures, naming them the World when taken together, yet Thou hast parted the single name among four creatures: One is Earth, the second Water, the third Air, the fourth Fire."
"To each of them Thou hast appointed its own separate place; each is kept distinct from the other, and yet held in bonds of peace by Thine ordinance, so that none of them should overstep the other’s bounds, but cold brooketh heat, and wet suffereth dry."
Earth and water have a cold nature; earth is dry and cold; water wet and cold.
"Air is defined as both cold and wet, and also warm."
"This is not to be wondered at, for air is created half-way between the dry cold earth and the hot fire."
Fire is uppermost above all these worldly creatures.
"Wonderful is Thy contriving, to have done both things: namely, to have bounded things one over against the other, and likewise to have mingled the dry cold earth beneath the cold wet water, so that the yielding and flowing water hath a floor on the solid earth, being unable to stand alone.Edition: current; Page: [89]The earth holdeth the water and in some degree sucketh it in, and is moistened by what it sucketh, so that it groweth and beareth blossoms and likewise fruits; for, if the water did not moisten it, it would dry up and be scattered by the wind like dust or ashes."
"No living thing could enjoy the land or the water, nor dwell in either for the cold, if Thou hadst not in some measure mingled them with fire."
"With marvellous skill Thou hast so ordered that fire doth not burn up water and earth, when mingled with either; nor again do water and earth wholly quench fire."
"The real home of water is on the earth, likewise in the air, and again above the skies."
"The real home of fire is above all visible worldly creatures, yet it is mingled with all; no creature, however, can it utterly destroy, for it hath not the leave of the Almighty."
"Next, the earth is heavier and denser than other creatures, for it is lower than any other save the firmament."
"The firmament surroundeth it from day to day, though it nowhere toucheth it; at every point it is equally near it, both above and beneath."
"Each of the substances we have spoken of hath its own place apart, and yet one is mingled with another; for no creature can exist without the other, though not apparent in it."
"Thus earth, ice, and water are very hard for ignorant men to see or conceive of in fire; nevertheless they are mingled therewith."
"Fire also subsisteth in stones and in water; it is very hard to perceive, but still it is there."
"Thou hast bound fire in bonds very hard to loose, so that it cannot come to its own home, that is,Edition: current; Page: [90]P. 90.to the exceeding great fire above us, lest it forsake the earth."
All other creatures will perish from uttermost cold if it utterly depart.
"Thou hast made fast the earth very wonderfully and firmly, so that it leaneth to no side, nor standeth on any earthly thing; nor doth anything of the earth keep it from falling, nor is it easier for it to fall down than up."
"Thou plantest also threefold souls in befitting members, so that there is not less of the soul in the little finger than in the whole body."
I said the soul was threefold because philosophers affirm that it hath three natures.
"One of these natures is to be subject to desire, the second to be subject to passion, and the third that it is rational."
"Two of these qualities are possessed by beasts in the same way as by men, namely, desire and passion; no creature, save man alone, hath reason, and therefore he hath excelled all earthly creatures in forethought and sense."
"Reason must control both desire and passion, for it is a special virtue of the soul."
"Thou hast fashioned the soul so as to turn upon itself, as the whole firmament doth, or as a wheel turneth, reflecting on its Creator, on itself, or on these earthly things."
When it thinketh on its Creator it is above itself; when it reflecteth on itself it is in itself; and it is beneath itself when it loveth these earthly things and admireth them.
"O Lord, Thou gavest to souls a home in heaven, and there givest them honourable gifts, to each according to its deserving; and Thou makest them to shine exceeding bright, and yet with very various brightness, some more brightly, some less, likeEdition: current; Page: [91]P. 91.the stars, each according to its merits."
"Thou, O Lord, bringest together heavenly souls and earthly bodies, and minglest them in this world."
"As they came hither from Thee, even so also they seek to go hence to Thee."
"Thou didst fill this earth with divers kinds of beasts, and afterwards didst sow it with divers seeds of trees and plants."
"Grant unto our minds, O Lord, that they may rise up to Thee through the hardships of this world, and from these troubles come to Thee, and that with the eyes of our minds opened we may behold the noble fountain of all good things, even Thee."
"Grant us health for our minds’ eyes, that we may fasten them upon Thee, and scatter the mist that now hangeth before our minds’ sight, and let Thy light lighten our eyes; for Thou art the Brightness of the True Light."
"Thou art the comfortable resting-place of the righteous, and Thou enablest them to see Thee."
Thou art the Beginning and the End of all things.
Thou bearest up all things without effort.
"Thou art the Way, and the Guide, and the Bourne whither the Way leadeth; to Thee all men are hastening.’

XXXIV

WHEN Philosophy had chaunted this song and prayer, she began once more to discourse, and spake on this wise:

‘I think it first necessary that I should unfold to Edition: current; Page: [92]thee where the Highest Good is, now that I have explained to thee what it is; which was the perfect, which the imperfect good."
But one thing I would first ask thee: Dost thou believe anything in this world is so good that it can bestow perfect happiness?
I ask thee this because I do not wish any false image to deceive us in place of True Happiness.
"No man can deny that there is a certain Good, the highest, like a great and deep spring, whence many brooks and streamlets flow."
"Concerning any form of good we say that it is not perfect good, inasmuch as it lacks something; and yet it is not utterly lacking, for everything comes to naught if it has nothing good in it."
"By this thou mayest perceive that the less forms of good come from the greatest good, not the greatest from the less, even as a river does not become a spring, but the spring may become a river."
"And yet the river does in the end return to the spring; and so every form of good comes from God and again returns to Him, and He is the full and perfect Good that lacks no desire."
Thou canst now clearly perceive that this is Good in itself.
"Canst thou not understand that if nothing were complete, then nothing would be lacking, and, if nothing were lacking, nothing would be complete?"
"For, if anything be full, something else must be not full, and the converse is true, and moreover each thing is most complete in its own native place."
"Surely thou canst understand that if any of these earthly forms of good be lacking in regard to any desire and advantage a certain form of good must Edition: current; Page: [93]exist, complete as to every desire, and lacking in no advantage.’

‘Thou hast,’ I answered, ‘with great justice and reason overcome me and taken me captive, so that I cannot gainsay thee nor even imagine but that it is as thou sayest.’

Then spake Philosophy, ‘I would now have thee consider earnestly till thou perceive where Perfect Happiness lies."
Dost thou not know that all mankind with one mind are agreed that God is the origin of all good things and the Lord of all creation?
"He is the Highest Good, and no man now doubts it; for nothing better, nor even equally good, is known to men."
"All reason tells us, and all men acknowledge the same, that God is the Highest Good, thereby betokening that all forms of good exist in Him; for if it were not so, then he would not be true to His name."
"If anything existed before Him or more perfect than He, it would be better than He, but inasmuch as nothing existed before Him, nor is more perfect, nor more precious, He is the Origin, and Source, and Pinnacle of all forms of good."
It is quite evident that perfect good existed before imperfect good.
"Not to speak longer than we need, what we have to believe is that the Most High God is the most perfect in all good."
"The same God is, as we have before said, the Highest Good and the Best Happiness, seeing that it is generally known that the best kind of happiness exists in no other being but God.’

‘I grant this,’ I answered."
"Edition: current; Page: [94]

Then said she, ‘I entreat thee to understand clearly that God is full of every perfection, every goodness, and every form of happiness.’

‘I repeat it,’ she said ‘because I would not have thee believe that God, who is the Father and Beginning of all creatures, hath received from any outward source the high goodness of which He is full."
"Nor again would I have thee believe that He is not the same as His goodness and happiness; for if thou didst believe that His goodness was come from without, then would the source of it be better than He."
"But it is very great folly and sin to think thus of God, or to believe that anything existed before Him, or was better than or like unto Him."
We must then allow that God is the best of all things.
"If thou believest that it is with God as with man, in whom the man himself, that is, soul and body, is one thing, and his goodness another; if, I say, thou believest that it is so with God, then must thou needs believe that there is a power greater than His, one that brings together His parts, as He does ours."
"Now, everything that is distinct from another is different, though they be joined; if then anything be distinct from the Highest Good, it is not the Highest Good."
"But it is grievous sin to believe concerning God that any good exists save in Him, or when separate from Him, for nothing is better than He, no, nor equally good."
"Therefore I say with perfect reason that that which is the Edition: current; Page: [95]beginning of all things is in its own nature the Highest Good.’

M. Thou hast most fairly convinced me."
"P. Now, I told thee that the Highest Good and the Highest Happiness were one and the same thing."
M. That is so.
"P. Well then, what are we to call this but God?"
"M. I cannot deny this, for I have already admitted it."
"Then she said, ‘Canst thou understand the matter any the more clearly if I mention yet another example to thee?"
"Suppose there were two kinds of good that could not exist together, and yet were both good, would it not be quite evident that neither was the other?"
"Perfect good, then, cannot be divided."
How can it be full and yet lacking?
"Therefore we say that Perfect Happiness and God are but one form of Good, and that is the highest; these can never be divided."
"Are we not then bound to admit that the Highest Good and the Godhead are one?’

‘Nothing is truer than this,’ I said; ‘we can find nothing better than God.’

‘But I will wrap thee round,’ said she, ‘with yet another instance, so that thou mayest not find any way out; even as the wont of philosophers is to be ever seeking to show something new and unfamiliar, that they may therewith awaken the minds of their hearers."
‘Did we not prove that happiness and the divine nature were one?
"He therefore who has happiness has both, and he that has both, is he not supremely blessed?"
"Knowest thou not that we say a man is wise Edition: current; Page: [96]who has wisdom, and righteous who has righteousness?"
"And so also we name God that which has the divine nature and happiness, and every happy man is a god."
"Yet there is only one God; he is the stem and base of all forms of good; from Him these forms all come, and to Him they return, and He ruleth all."
"Though He is the beginning and foundation of all good men and all good things, yet the forms of good that issue from Him are many, even as all stars receive their light and brightness from the sun, yet some are more, others less bright."
"Likewise the moon shines according as the sun illumines her; when she is fully lighted up by him, she shines with all her brightness.’

Now when I understood this discourse I was dismayed and sore afraid, and I said, ‘Truly this is a wonderful and pleasing and rational discourse that thou art now speaking.’

‘Nothing,’ she said, ‘is more pleasing nor more wise than the matter of this discourse, and that which we are going to discuss; and so I think we had better join it on to our former discourse.’

‘Why, what is that?’ said I."
"Then said she, ‘Well, thou knowest that I told thee that True Happiness was a good thing, and from True Happiness come and to it return all the other forms of good that we have spoken of."
"Even so from the sea the water makes its way into the earth, and there grows fresh; then it comes up at the spring, becomes a brook, then a river, then follows the course of the river until it comes again to the sea."
But I would Edition: current; Page: [97]now ask thee how thou hast understood this discourse.
"Dost thou believe that the five forms of good we have often before mentioned, namely, Power, Honour, Fame, Independence, and Happy Temper—I wish, I say, to know whether thou believest these forms of good are members of True Happiness, even as there are many members in one man, yet all form one body; or on the other hand, whether thou dost think that each of the five forms of good gives rise to True Happiness, and then the (other) four make up the qualities of True Happiness."
"For instance, soul and body make but one man, and the man has many members; yet to these two, namely, the soul and the body, belong all the good points of the man, both of the spirit and of the flesh."
"Thus bodily excellence lies in a man’s being fair, strong, tall, and broad, and there are many other good points besides; yet they are not the body itself, for even if it lose any of these qualities it still remains what it was before."
"Again, the kinds of excellence belonging to the soul are caution, moderation, patience, righteousness, wisdom, and many like virtues."
M. I wish thou wouldst speak yet more clearly regarding the other good qualities belonging to True Happiness.
P. Have I not already told thee that happiness is a good thing?
"M. Yes, and moreover thou saidst it was the Highest Good."
"P. Dost thou still admit that Power, Honour, Fame, Edition: current; Page: [98]Independence, Good Temper, Blessedness, and the Highest Good, are all one thing, and this is good?"
M. How shall I deny this?
"P. What dost thou then believe that these things are, members of True Happiness, or True Happiness itself?"
"M. I see what thou wouldst know; but I would rather have thee speak to me about this matter, than ask me questions."
P. Canst thou not conceive that if the forms of good were members of True Happiness they would be in some measure divided; even as the members of man’s body are somewhat divided?
"But the nature of members is that they form but one body, and yet are not wholly alike."
M. Thou needest not labour the point; thou hast said quite clearly that the forms of good are in no wise separated from True Happiness.
"P. Thou hast a right understanding of the matter, inasmuch as thou dost perceive that the forms of good are the same thing as happiness, and happiness is the Highest Good, which is God, and God is ever one and undivided."
M. There is no doubt about it; but now I should like thee to tell me something unfamiliar.
"Then she said: ‘It is now evident that all the forms of good we spoke of belong to the Highest Good, and men seek a sufficiency of good, believing it to be the Highest Good."
"They also seek power and all the other advantages we have already mentioned, because they Edition: current; Page: [99]believe this to be the Highest Good."
"Thereby thou mayest know that the Highest Good is the roof to all the other kinds of good that men desire and take pleasure in, for no man takes pleasure in anything but what is good, or at least what looks like good."
"Many a thing they crave that is not perfect good, yet has some likeness to what is good."
"This is why we say that the Highest Good is the highest roof to all kinds of good, the hinge on which they all turn, and the thing for which all good is wrought by men; it is for this that men take pleasure in all kinds of good that they affect."
"This thou mayest very plainly perceive by considering that no man takes pleasure in the thing itself which he affects or does, but in that which he gains by its means; for he thinks that, if he compass his desire and carry through that which he has thought of, he has perfect happiness."
"Dost thou not know that no man rides from a desire to ride, but because by his riding he gains some profit?"
"Some by riding gain better health, some greater activity, while others desire to reach some place that they have in view."
"Now, surely it is plain enough that men love nothing more dearly than the Highest Good, for every desire or deed of theirs arises from their wish to find therein the Highest Good."
"But some of them err in thinking they can have perfect good and perfect happiness from these present Kinds of Good; whereas Perfect Happiness and the Highest Good is God Himself, as we have often said.’

‘I cannot imagine,’ I said, ‘how I can deny this.’

Edition: current; Page: [100]

Then said she, ‘Let us now leave the matter, and trouble no more about it, since thou hast got to know so thoroughly that God is ever the indivisible and perfect Goodness, and that His goodness and His happiness came not to Him from without, but have always been, are now, and ever shall be contained in Himself.’

When Philosophy had uttered this discourse, she began again to chaunt, and these were the words she sang:

P. 100."
"‘Ah well, ye men, let each that is free make for goodness and happiness; and let him that is now held captive by the unprofitable love of this world seek freedom, so that he may come to happiness."
For this is the one resting-place from all our toils; and this haven alone is ever calm after all the storms and billows of our hardships.
"It is the only refuge, the sole comfort of poor mortals after the misery of this present life."
"But golden gems and silver, and jewels of every kind, and all this wealth of the present in no wise give light to the eyes of the mind, nor whet their keenness to the beholding of True Happiness; but they blind the eyes of the mind even more than they sharpen them."
All things that here please in this life of the present are earthly and therefore fleeting.
"But the marvellous Brightness that lighteneth all things and ruleth them will not suffer souls to perish, but will give them light."
"If then any man be able to see with clear mind’s eye the brightness of the heavenly Light, he will say that the brightness of the sun’s shining Edition: current; Page: [101]is as darkness when measured with the everlasting brightness of God.’

When Philosophy had chaunted this lay, I said, ‘I grant what thou sayest, for thou hast shown its truth with wise argument.’

P. What price wouldst thou pay to be able to understand True Goodness, and what manner of thing it is?"
"M. I should rejoice with an exceeding great joy, and I would pay a sum beyond counting that I might see it."
"P. Well then, I will show it thee; but one thing I charge thee, and that is, not to forget in the showing of it what I have already taught thee."
"M. No, indeed, I shall not forget it."
"P. Did we not say before that this present life that we here desire is not the Highest Good, being diverse and divided into so many parts that no man may have all without being lacking in some respect?"
"I showed thee at the time that the Highest Good is found where all forms of good are united, melted as it were into one ingot."
"Perfect good exists when all the kinds of good that we formerly spoke of are gathered together into a single kind of good; then there will be no form of good lacking; all the forms of good will form a unity, and this unity shall be eternal."
"If they were not eternal, they would not be so much to be desired."
M. This has been said; I cannot doubt it.
"P. I said before that that was not Perfect Good which was not all combined, for Perfect Good is that which is all combined and indivisible."
"Edition: current; Page: [102]

M. I think so too."
P. Dost thou then think that all things that are good in this world are good because they contain in themselves some goodness?
M. What else can I believe?
Surely it is so.
P. Yet thou must believe that Oneness and Goodness are the same.
M. This I cannot deny.
"P. Canst thou not conceive that everything may go on existing, both in this world and the world to come, as long as it is undivided, but when divided it will not be altogether what it was before?"
M. Say that to me more plainly; I cannot quite make out what thou wouldst be at.
P. Knowest thou what man is?
M. I know he is soul and body.
"P. Well, thou knowest that it is man so long as soul and body are undivided; and not man, once they are divided."
"So too the body is body while it has all its limbs; if however it lose any limb, it is no longer quite as it was before."
"The same holds good of anything; nothing remains what it was, once it begins to suffer loss."
M. Now I understand.
"P. Dost thou think there is any creature that of its own will does not wish to exist for ever, but would of its own accord perish?"
"M. I cannot conceive of any living thing knowing its own likes or dislikes that would care to perish of its own accord; for every creature would like to be healthy Edition: current; Page: [103]and alive, at least of those that I consider to have life; I am not sure about trees and plants, and such creatures as have no soul."
"At this she smiled and said, ‘Thou needest not have any more doubts concerning the one kind of creatures than about the other."
"Canst thou not see that each plant and each tree will grow best in land that suits it best and is natural and familiar to it, where it feels that it can grow quickest and wither slowest?"
"Some plants and trees have their home on hills, some in fens, some on moors, others among stones, others again in bare sand."
"Take any tree or plant thou wilt from the place where its home is and its habits of growth, and set it in an unfamiliar spot; it will not grow there at all, but will wither, for the nature of every country is to bring forth plants and trees like itself, and it does so in this case."
It nurses them and helps them very carefully so long as their nature allows them to grow.
"Why, thinkest thou, does every seed creep into the earth and grow into shoots and roots but because it wants the trunk and the tree-top to stand the firmer and the longer?"
"Canst thou not understand, though thou canst not see it, that all the part of the tree that grows in the course of twelve months begins at the roots, and, growing upwards to the stem, passes along the core and the bark to the top, and afterwards along the boughs, until it springs forth in leaves and flowers and shoots?"
Canst thou not perceive that every living thing is most tender and delicate inside?
"Why, thou canst see how a tree is clad and wrapped about with Edition: current; Page: [104]the bark against winter and stiff gales, and also against the sun’s heat in summer."
"Who can help wondering at such creatures of our Creator, and at the Creator too?"
"And, though we marvel at Him, which of us can duly set forth our Creator’s will and power, how His creatures grow and wane when the time comes for it, and are once more renewed from their seed, as if they were a new creation?"
"Lo, they live once more, and in a measure seem to live for ever, for every year they are created afresh."
"‘Dost thou yet perceive that the dumb creatures would like to live for ever, as men do, if they were able?"
"Dost thou yet understand why fire tends upwards, and earth downwards?"
"Why is this, save because God made the home of the one on high and of the other below?"
"for every creature tends most to go where its home and its nature chiefly lie, and shuns that which is hostile to it or unfitting or unlike."
"Lo, stones, being of an inert and stubborn nature, are hard to cleave asunder, and likewise come together with pains, if they have been parted."
"If therefore thou cleavest a stone it will never be united as it before was, but water and air are of a somewhat more yielding kind; they are very easy to cleave, but are soon joined again."
"Fire, however, can never be divided."
"Not long ago I said that no creature would perish by its own desire; but now I am more concerned with nature than desire, for these sometimes are diversely minded."
Thou mayest know by many tokens that nature is very mighty.
"It is a very mighty act of Edition: current; Page: [105]nature that to our body all its strength comes from the food we eat, and yet the food passes out through the body."
"But its savour and its virtue pass into every vein, even as when a man sifts meal the meal passes through each hole, and the bran is sifted out."
"So also our spirit journeys very far without our will or control, by reason of its nature, not of its will; this happens when we are asleep."
"Lo, the beasts and also the other creatures covet what they desire rather by virtue of nature than will."
"It is unnatural for any being to desire danger or death, yet many a thing is constrained to seek one or the other, for the will is stronger than nature."
"Sometimes the will is stronger than nature, sometimes nature overcomes the will."
"Such is the case, for example, with carnal desire; it is natural to every man, and yet is sometimes withheld from its natural action by a man’s will."
"All love of lechery is of nature, not of the will."
"‘By this thou mayest plainly perceive that the Creator of all things hath bestowed one desire and one common nature upon all His creatures, and that is the desire of living for ever."
"For each being it is natural to desire to live for ever, in so far as its nature may admit."
"Thou needest not have the doubt thou hadst before, concerning the creatures that have no soul; all creatures, whether possessing souls or not, desire to exist always.’

‘Now I understand,’ said I, ‘what I was before in doubt about, that is, that every creature is desirous of living for ever."
"This is very apparent in the begetting of offspring.’

Edition: current; Page: [106]

P. Dost thou then perceive that every thing that thinks of existence thinks of being combined, whole, undivided?"
For if it is divided it is not whole.
M. That is true.
"P. That is to say, all things nevertheless have one desire, to wit, the desire of living for ever, and with this single desire they crave the one good thing that lives for ever, namely God."
M. It is even as thou sayest.
"P. Well then, thou mayest clearly perceive that that which all things and all creatures wish to have is a thoroughly good thing."
"M. No man can speak more truly; for I am sure all things created would flow asunder like water, and would not keep peace nor due order."
"They would fall apart in great disorder and come to naught, as we long since said in this very book, were there not one God to guide and govern and control them."
"But now, inasmuch as we know that there is one Ruler of all things, we must needs allow, whether we will or no, that He is the crowning roof to all kinds of good."
"At this she smiled upon me and said: ‘Well, well, my child, truly thou art exceeding happy in thine understanding, and I am very glad of it."
"Thou hast very nearly come to know what is right, and that very thing which thou didst before profess thyself unable to understand thou wouldst now agree to.’

‘What was that which I said I could not understand?’ I said."
"Edition: current; Page: [107]

‘Why, thou didst say,’ she answered, ‘that thou knewest not the end of every creature; but learn now that the end of every creature is that which thou hast thyself named, even God."
"To Him all creatures are wending; they have no good to seek beyond this, nor can they find anything higher or outside Him.’

XXXV

WHEN she had spoken this discourse, she began to sing once more in these words:

‘Whosoever will search deeply with earnest mind after truth, and would have no man nor thing to hinder him, let him begin to seek within himself that which he before sought outside, and have done with useless troubling, as far as he may; and let him attend to this one matter, and tell his mind that it can find within itself all the good things which it seeketh without."
"Then will he be able very quickly to perceive the evil and vanity that he had before in his mind, as clearly as thou mayest see the sun."
"Thou wilt then perceive thine own understanding, that it is far brighter and clearer than the sun."
"For no grossness nor infirmity of the body hath power utterly to take away righteousness from his mind, so that he shall have no trace thereof, though bodily sloth and infirmities often vex the mind with a dullness and lead it astray with a mist of delusion, so that itEdition: current; Page: [108]P. 108.cannot shine as brightly as it would."
"Nevertheless a grain of the seed of truth is ever dwelling in the soul, so long as soul and body are united."
"This grain must be awakened with questioning and with teaching, if it is to grow."
"How then can any man question righteously and shrewdly, if he have in himself not a jot of righteousness?"
"None is so sorely bereft of righteousness that he can give no right answer, when asked."
"It is a very true saying that philosopher Plato spake: “Whosoever,” said he, “remembereth not righteousness, should turn him to his memory; then shall he find righteousness hid there amid the sloth of the body and the distractions and afflictions of his mind.” ’

Then said I, ‘I admit that was a true saying that Plato spake."
Hast thou not now reminded me twice of the same matter?
"First thou saidst I had forgotten the natural goodness I had within myself, owing to the sloth of the body."
"The second time thou saidst thou hadst noticed that I was myself of the opinion that I had utterly lost the natural goodness I ought to have within me, owing to my unmeasured sorrow for my lost prosperity.’

P. Hadst thou but called to mind the words I spake to thee in the first book, thou wouldst thereby clearly have perceived what it was thou didst profess not to know."
M. What was it that I said I did not know?
"P. Thou saidst in the same book that thou wast convinced that God ruled this world, but thou didst Edition: current; Page: [109]also say thou couldst not understand after what fashion He ruled it."
"M. I remember quite well mine own foolishness, and I had already acknowledged it before thou didst speak of it."
"However, although I in some degree understood the matter at the time, I would hear yet more from thee concerning it."
P. Thou didst not doubt that God governed and ruled all the world?
"M. I have till now no doubts of it, nor ever shall have any."
I will further tell thee shortly how I first came to know it.
"I perceived that this world was put together out of many and diverse materials, and very firmly stuck and cemented together."
"If these materials, being so froward, had not been brought together and set in order, they would never have been made nor yet combined; and if He had not bound them with fetters that cannot be loosed they would all fall asunder."
"Their places and their courses had not been ordered so wisely, so fittingly, and so regularly in respect of their positions and their seasons, were there not one unchanging God to wield them."
"Him, as He is the Good One, I call by the name of God, even as all creatures call Him."
P. 109.
"Thereupon she said, ‘Now that thou hast so clear an understanding, I need not trouble over-much to tell thee more about God, for thou art wellnigh come into the city of True Happiness which long ago thou couldst not reach."
"But we must nevertheless seek that which we before had in mind.’

Edition: current; Page: [110]

M. What is that?"
"P. Did we not prove that Sufficiency was Happiness, and Happiness was God?"
M. It is as thou sayest.
"P. God needs no other help save Himself, wherewith to rule His creatures, no more than He needed to make them; for if He needed help in any thing He would not be self-sufficient."
M. It is as thou sayest.
"P. By Himself He did create all things, and governeth all things."
M. I cannot gainsay this.
P. We have already shown thee that God is through Himself good.
M. I remember thou didst say so.
"P. Through goodness God created all things, for of Himself He ruleth all that we before said was good; and He is alone the steady Ruler, and Steersman, and Rudder, and Helm, for He guideth and governeth all creatures, even as a good steersman does a ship."
"M. Now I confess to thee that I have found a door where before I saw but a little crack, so that I could only just spy a very little gleam of light from out this darkness."
"Thou didst show me the door, but I was none the abler to come to it, and I groped about it where I saw the little gleam twinkling."
"I told thee long since in this very book that I knew not what was the beginning of all creatures, and then thou didst tell me it was God."
"Next I knew not concerning the end, until again thou didst tell me it was also God."
"Edition: current; Page: [111]Then I told thee I knew not how He ruled all creation; but thou hast now set it very plain before me, as if thou hadst plucked open the door I had been seeking."
"Then she made answer unto me, and said: ‘I know that I once put thee in mind of this very matter, and now methinks thou art getting to know better and better about the truth."
"Nevertheless I would further show thee an instance, as plain as that which I mentioned before.’

‘What is it?’ I said."
"Then said she: ‘No man can doubt that God reigneth over all creatures by their own consent, and they humbly turn their wills to His will."
"Thereby it is very evident that God wieldeth everything with the helm and rudder of His goodness, for all creatures naturally of their own will strive to reach God, as we have already often said in this very book.’

M. Who can doubt this?"
"for God’s power would not be full happiness, if creatures obeyed Him against their will."
"P. There is no creature that thinks it must resist its Creator’s will, if it would be true to its nature."
M. No creature wishes to resist its Creator’s will save foolish man or the rebellious angels.
"P. How thinkest thou, if any creature deemed itself bound to fight against His will, what would it avail against One so mighty as we have shown Him to be?"
"M. They cannot do so, even though they wish it."
"Edition: current; Page: [112]

Hereupon she marvelled, saying: ‘There is nothing that is able or willing to gainsay so exalted a God.’

M. Nor do I fancy anything is willing to fight against Him, excepting what we before spoke of."
"At this she smiled and said, ‘Know for a truth that that is the Highest Good which ordereth all things so mightily, and created all, and so fittingly ruleth all, and setteth it all out so easily without any effort.’

M. What thou didst tell me before pleased me well, and this pleases me even better; but I am now ashamed that I did not perceive it before."
P. 112.P.
"Truly I know thou hast often heard tell in old fables how that Job (Jove) son of Saturn was the highest god above all other gods, and was son of the sky, and reigned in heaven; and how there were Giants, sons of the earth, who did rule over the earth, and how they were, so to speak, sisters’ children, Jove being son of the sky, and they sons of the earth."
"Now the Giants were wrath that he had sway over them, and sought to burst the heavens beneath him; but he sent thunders and lightnings and winds, and scattered therewith all their handiwork, and themselves he slew."
"Such were the false stories they made up; they could easily have told true ones, and yet very like the others, if false ones had not seemed sweeter to them."
They could have told what foolishness Nefrod (Nimrod) the Giant wrought.
"Nefrod was son of Chus (Cush), Chus was son of Cham (Ham), Cham son of Noe (Noah)."
"Nefrod bade build aEdition: current; Page: [113]tower in the field called Sennar (Shinar), and among the folk called Deira (Dura), hard by the town which men now call Babylonia."
"This they did for the reason that they wished to know how near it was to heaven, how thick and fast heaven was, and what was above it."
"But it fell out, as was fitting, that the divine might dashed them down before they could bring it to a head, and cast down the tower and slew many a man among them, and split their speech into two and seventy tongues."
"Thus it happens to all that strive against the might of God; their honour grows not thereby, and that which they had before is lessened."
But consider now whether thou wilt have us search any further after distinctions now that we have found what we were looking for.
"I think, however, that if we go on letting our words clash together there will spring up some spark of truth that we have not yet seen."
M. Do as thou wilt.
"P. Now, no man doubts that God is so mighty that He can bring to pass what He pleases."
M. No man doubts this that knows aught.
P. Is there any one that thinks there is anything that God cannot do?
M. I know there is not.
P. Dost thou think He is able to do anything evil?
M. I know He is not able.
"P. Thou sayest truly, for there is no such thing; Edition: current; Page: [114]if evil existed, God could do it, and so it does not exist."
"M. It seems to me thou art misleading and baffling me, as a child does."
"Thou leadst me hither and thither into a wood so thick that I cannot get out; for always after a while thou takest up again the same matter that thou wast before speaking about, and then thou givest it up before finishing it, and takest hold on a strange matter, so that I know not what thou wouldst be at."
Methinks thou art turning round about a wonderful and strange discourse concerning the unity of the Godhead.
"I remember thou didst tell me a marvellous tale about it, saying that Happiness and the Highest Good were all one."
"Thou saidst that Happiness was firmly rooted in the Highest Good, and the Highest Good was God Himself, who was abounding in every happiness; and thou didst say that every happy man was a god."
"Next, thou saidst that God’s goodness and His happiness were all one with Himself, even the Most High God, and to this God all creatures that are true to their kind tend and desire to come."
"Moreover, thou didst say that God governed all His creatures with the rudder of His goodness, and that all creatures of their own will and undriven were subject to Him."
"Now, lastly, thou hast said that there is no such thing as evil; and all this thou hast proved to be true, most reasonably and without any false imagining."
"Then said she, ‘Thou hast said that I lead thee astray, but I for my part do not think I mislead thee, Edition: current; Page: [115]P. 115. but have told thee an exceeding long and wondrous and rational tale about the God that we once prayed to; and I mean yet further to unfold to thee concerning the same God a somewhat unfamiliar tale."
"It is of the nature of Godhead that it can exist unmixed with other things and without the support of other things, as no other thing can exist."
"No creature can stand by itself, as Parmenides the poet long ago sang, saying, “Almighty God is the ruler of all things, and He alone dwelleth without change, and wieldeth all things that change.” Therefore thou needest not wonder exceedingly if we go on searching into that which we have taken in hand, with less or more words, as we can show it forth."
"Though we have to treat of many and diverse instances and parables, yet our mind cleaves all the while to that which we are searching into."
"We use not these instances and these parables from a love of fables, but because we desire therewith to show forth the truth, and would like it to be of profit to our hearers."
"By the way, I call to mind a precept of the wise Plato; he said that a man who would make use of parables should not take those that were too foreign to the matter he was speaking of at the moment."
"But listen patiently to what I am now going to say; though once it seemed to thee unprofitable, perhaps the end will please thee better.’

Here she fell to singing, and said,

Blessed is the man that is able to see the clear wellspring of the Highest Good, and cast off the darkness of his mind."
We must tell thee yet another Edition: current; Page: [116]from the fables of old.
"Once on a time it came to pass that a harp-player lived in the country called Thracia, which was in the kingdom of the Crecas (Greeks)."
"The harper was so good, it was quite unheard of."
"His name was Orfeus, and he had a wife without her equal, named Eurudice."
"Now men came to say of the harper that he could play the harp so that the forest swayed, and the rocks quivered for the sweet sound, and wild beasts would run up and stand still as if they were tame, so still that men or hounds might come near them, and they fled not."
"The harper’s wife died, men say, and her soul was taken to hell."
"Then the harpman became so sad that he could not live in the midst of other men, but was off to the forest, and sate upon the hills both day and night, weeping, and playing on his harp so that the woods trembled and the rivers stood still, and hart shunned not lion, nor hare hound, nor did any beast feel rage or fear towards any other for gladness of the music."
"And when it seemed to the harper that nothing in this world brought joy to him he thought he would seek out the gods of hell and essay to win them over with his harp, and pray them to give him back his wife."
"When he came thither, the hound of hell, men say, came towards him, whose name was Ceruerus and who had three heads; and he began to welcome him with his tail, and play with him on account of his harp-playing."
"There was likewise there a most dreadful gateward whose name was Caron; he had also three heads, and was very,Edition: current; Page: [117]very old."
"Then the harper fell to beseeching him that he would shield him while he was in that place, and bring him back again unharmed."
"And he promised him to do so, being overjoyed at the rare music."
"Then he went on farther until he met the fell goddesses that men of the people call Parcæ, saying that they know no respect for any man, but punish each according to his deeds; and they are said to rule each man’s fate."
And he began to implore their kindness; and they fell to weeping with him.
"Again he went on, and all the dwellers in hell ran to meet him, and fetched him to their king; and all began to speak with him and join in his prayer."
"And the ever-moving wheel, that Ixion king of the Leuitas (Lapithae) was bound to for his guilt, stood still for his harping, and King Tantalus, that was in this world greedy beyond measure, and whom that same sin of greed followed there, had rest, and the vulture, it is said, left off tearing the liver of King Ticcius (Tityus), whom he had thus been punishing."
And all the dwellers in hell had rest from their tortures whilst he was harping before the king.
"Now when he had played a long, long time, the king of hell’s folk cried out, saying, ‘Let us give the good man his wife, for he hath won her with his harping.’ Then he bade him be sure never to look back once he was on his way thence; if he looked back, he said, he should forfeit his wife."
"But love may hardly, nay, cannot be denied!"
Alas and well-a-day!
"Orpheus led his wife along with him, Edition: current; Page: [118]until he came to the border of light and darkness, and his wife was close behind."
"He had but stepped into the light when he looked back towards his wife, and immediately she was lost to him."
"These fables teach every man that would flee from the darkness of hell and come to the light of the True Goodness that he should not look towards his old sins, so as again to commit them as fully as he once did."
"For whosoever with entire will turneth his mind back to the sins he hath left, and then doeth them and taketh full pleasure in them, and never after thinketh of forsaking them, that man shall lose all his former goodness, unless he repent."
Here endeth the third book of Boethius and beginneth the fourth.
"XXXVI

AFTER that Philosophy had chaunted this lay very pleasantly and skilfully, I had still in my mind a trace of the sadness that I had formerly, and I said, ‘O Philosophy, thou that art the messenger and forerunner of the True Light, how wonderful it seems to me, what thou tellest me, for I perceive that all that thou hast said to me was told me by God through thee."
"I knew this also before in some measure, but this sadness had hampered me, so that I had clean forgotten it."
"Now the greatest part of my unhappiness comes from wondering why Edition: current; Page: [119]the good God should let any evil exist, or if it must exist, and He is willing to allow it, why He doth not right soon punish it."
"Now, thou mayest thyself understand that this is a wonderful thing; but there is also another thing that seems to me a still greater marvel, and that is, that folly and unrighteousness now rule over all the earth, while wisdom and other virtues besides have no praise nor honour in this world."
"They lie despised like dung in a midden, and evil men in every land are now in honour, and the good suffer manifold punishments."
"Who can forbear to sigh for this, and marvel at such a spectacle, that such evil should ever arise under the rule of almighty God, now that we know He hath knowledge thereof and desireth all that is good?’

Then said she, ‘If it be as thou sayest, then is this a horror more awful than any other, and a ceaseless wonder, just as if in a king’s court vessels of gold and silver were despised, and wooden ones held in esteem."
"It is not at all as thou thinkest; but if thou wilt call to mind all that which we have spoken about, with the help of that God concerning whom we are now speaking, thou mayest come to see that the good are always in power, but the wicked have none; that virtues are never without praise and reward, nor are vices ever unpunished, but the good are ever happy, and the bad unhappy."
"I can show thee very many examples of this, which may strengthen thee so that thou shalt have no reason for further lamenting."
"But I am now going to point thee out the way that will lead thee to Edition: current; Page: [120]P. 120.the heavenly city from which thou camest, as soon as thou perceivest through my teaching what True Happiness is, and where it lies."
"But first I must fledge thy mind, that it may raise itself up more easily before it shall begin to fly to the heights, so that it may fly free from hurt or care to its home, and leave behind all the confusion that it is now suffering from."
"Let it sit in my car, let it run forth on my way; I will be its guide.’

After that Philosophy had spoken this discourse, she began to sing, and said, ‘I have wings very swift, so that I am able to fly above the high roof of the heavens."
"But if only I might fledge thy mind with wings, so that thou mightest fly with me, then mightest thou look down upon all these earthly things."
"If thou couldest fly above the firmament, thou couldest see the clouds beneath thee, and mightest fly above the fire that lieth between the firmament and the air, and journey with the sun between the heavenly bodies, and thence come to the firmament and afterward to that cold star we call the star of Saturn."
"It is all of ice, and roameth beyond other stars high above any other heavenly body."
"When thou hast journeyed out beyond this, then thou art above the swiftly moving firmament, and leavest behind the highest heaven; and then at last thou mayest have thy share in the True Light."
"There one King reigneth; He hath authority over all other kings; He wieldeth the bridle and the guiding-rein of all the whirling span of heaven and earth; He is the one Judge, steady and bright; He Edition: current; Page: [121]driveth the car of all creation."
"But if ever thou come to that path and that place that thou hast now forgotten, then wilt thou say, “This is my true home; hence I came, and hence I was begotten; here will I now stand fast; never will I hence depart.” Nevertheless I know that if ever it shall happen to thee to desire or to be allowed to visit once more the darkness of this world, then wilt thou see that the unrighteous kings and all the overweening rich ones are very feeble and poor wretches, even those same men whom this poor folk now most sorely dreadeth.’

Then said I, ‘Ah, Philosophy, great and wonderful is that which thou dost promise, and I doubt not either that thou canst make it good."
"Yet I entreat thee not to hold me back longer, but to show me the way; for thou canst see that I am longing for it.’

‘Thou must first understand,’ said she, ‘that the good always have power, and the evil never any, nor any virtue; for not one of them sees that good and evil are always in conflict."
"If therefore the good always have power, then the wicked never have any, for good and evil are at bitter strife."
"But I should like further to show thee rather more clearly regarding each of the two, that thou mayest the easier believe what I tell thee, now about one, now about the other."
"There are two things at which every man’s thoughts are aiming, to wit, desire and power; if then any man lack one of the two, he cannot with the other bring aught to an issue."
"For no man will begin what he does not wish to do, unless he must needs do it; and, Edition: current; Page: [122]even if he does wish to do it, he cannot, if he have not the power."
"By this thou mayst perceive clearly that, if thou seest any man desiring what he has not, ’tis the power he lacks.’

M. That is true; I cannot deny it."
"P. Next, if thou seest a man that is able to do what he wishes, thou hast no doubt that the power is his."
M. I have no doubt of it.
P. Every man is master of what is in his power.
M. I grant it.
"P. Canst thou still remember what I once told thee, namely, that the minds of all men desire to come to True Happiness, though they earn it in diverse ways?"
M. I remember it; it was clearly enough proved.
"P. And dost thou remember that I told thee that goodness and happiness were all one, and he that seeks happiness seeks goodness?"
M. I hold it quite fast in my memory.
"P. All men, both good and wicked, desire to come to goodness, though in different ways."
M. What thou sayest is true.
P. It is clear enough that good men are good because they meet with good.
M. Quite clear.
P. And good men get the good they desire.
M. So I believe.
P. The wicked would not be wicked if they were to meet with the good they desire.
"They are wicked because they do not compass it, and they fail to get it because they seek it not aright."
"Edition: current; Page: [123]

M. It is even as thou sayest."
"P. Therefore it is beyond doubt that the good have always power, while the wicked have none; for the good seek goodness aright, and the evil seek it wrongly."
M. He that does not believe this to be true has no belief at all in truth.
"Then said she, ‘How thinkest thou?"
"If two men are hastening to the same place, and have an equally great desire to get there, one of them having the use of his feet so as to be able to walk where he pleases, even as it would be natural for all men to be able, and the other being without the use of his feet and unable to walk, and yet longing to move on, and making shift to creep along the same path,—which of these two men thinkest thou the more able?’

M. There is no likeness; he that walks is mightier than he that creeps, inasmuch as he can go where he wishes more easily than the other; say what else thou wilt, every man knows this."
P. It is just the same with the good and the wicked; each of them by his nature desires to reach the Highest Good.
"But the good man is able to go where he pleases, for he seeks it by the right way, whereas the wicked man may not go where he desires, for he seeks it amiss."
But perhaps thou mayest not think so.
"M. Nay, that, and naught else, is what I think concerning thine argument."
"P. Very rightly thou dost conceive the matter, and Edition: current; Page: [124]this is also a token of thy health; even as it is the wont of leeches when they look upon a sick man, and behold in him any benign symptom, to tell him of it."
Methinks therefore that thy nature and thy habits do make a stout stand against folly.
I am now persuaded that thou art ready to take in my teachings; and therefore I would bring together for thee a number of arguments and instances whereby thou mayest the easier grasp what I am about to tell thee.
"Learn then how feeble the wicked are, in that they cannot reach the place where creatures without sense desire to go, and how much more feeble they would be if they had not a natural bent thereto."
Behold with how grievous a bond of folly and misery they are bound!
"Lo, children, when they can only just walk, aye, and old men, as long as they have power to walk, strive after some credit and renown, children riding their sticks and playing manifold games wherein they imitate their elders."
"Fools also will not take in hand any thing from which they may look for praise or reward; but they do what is worse, running hither and thither all abroad under the roof of all creation; and that which is known to creatures without sense is to fools unknown."
"Now virtues are better than vices, for every man has to admit, whether he will or no, that he is the mightiest that is able to reach the highest roof of all things created, even God."
"There is naught above Him, nor beneath Him, nor round about Him, but all things are within Him and in His power."
God must be earnestly loved.Edition: current; Page: [125]Pp.
125-127.
"Didst thou not say a while ago that he was most able to journey that had the power to walk, to the world’s end, if he wished, so that no part of this earth should lie beyond?"
"Even the same thou mayest think concerning God, as we have already said that he is mightiest that can go to Him; for anywhere beyond he cannot go."
"From all these reasonings thou mayest understand that the good are always powerful, and the bad are bereft of all might and virtue."
"Why then, thinkest thou, do they forsake virtues and cleave to vices?"
Methinks thou wilt say it is from ignorance that they know not how to tell them apart.
But what dost thou take to be more sinful than want of reason?
Why do they acknowledge that they are ignorant?
Why will they not seek after virtues and wisdom?
"’Tis sloth, I know, besets them and overcomes them with languor, and ’tis greed that blinds them."
"We have said that nothing is worse than want of common sense; but what are we to say if men of sense possess vices, and will not seek after wisdom and the virtues?"
"Thou wilt say, I know, that unchastity and intemperance beset them; yet what is weaker than the man who is overborne out of measure by his frail flesh, if he cease not after a time, and wrestle with his vices with all his might?"
"But what wilt thou say if a man chooses not to combat them, but of set purpose forswears all good and does evil, being yet able to reason?"
"I call him weak and altogether a thing of naught; for whosoever forswears the common God of all goodness, without Edition: current; Page: [126]a doubt he is naught."
"But whosoever desires to be virtuous desires to be wise; he then that is virtuous is wise, and he that is wise, the same is good."
"He that is good is happy; he that is happy is blest, and he that is blest is a god, according as we showed it forth in this very book."
"I now think that foolish men will marvel at what I said a while ago, that wicked men were naught, seeing they are more in number than the others."
"But even if they were never to believe it, yet it is true nevertheless; the wicked man we can never account pure and single-hearted, any more than we can call or account a dead man a living one."
"The living man is of even less account than the dead, if he repent not of his sin; but he that liveth an unruly life, and will not be true to his own nature, the same is naught."
"Yet I fancy thou wilt say the cases are not alike; that the wicked man is able to do evil though not good, whereas the dead man can do neither; but I say unto thee that the power of the wicked comes not from any virtue but from sins."
"If the wicked were ever good, they would do no evil."
"That a man can do evil is not power, but weakness; and if that be true which we proved before, that there is no evil, then he that works evil does naught."
M. What thou sayest is indeed true.
P. Have we not shown that nothing is mightier than the Highest Good?
M. It is even as thou sayest.
P. Nevertheless it can do no evil.
"Edition: current; Page: [127]

M. True."
P. Does any one think that a man is strong enough to do all he pleases?
M. No man in his senses thinks this.
"P. Well, but wicked men can do evil."
M. Alas!
would that they could not!
"P. It is evident that they can do evil, but not good, for the reason that there is no evil; but good men, if they have full power, are able to turn to good everything they please."
"Now, full power is to be reckoned the highest form of good, for not only power, but also the other kinds of good, and the virtues we long since named, are firmly fixed in the Highest Good."
"Even as the wall of every house is firmly set both on the floor and in the roof, so is every kind of good firmly seated in God, for He is both roof and floor of every form of good."
"Power is ever to be desired to the end that good may be done; for the best kind of power is for a man to have the ability and the will to do good, with less or more speed, as he may chance to have."
"For whosoever desireth to do good, the same desireth to possess goodness and with goodness to dwell."
"Therefore was Plato’s saying true enough, when he said that only the wise can turn to good what they please, but the wicked cannot even begin to do what they would."
Yet perhaps thou wilt say the good at times begin what they cannot bring to an issue; but I say they always accomplish it.
"Though they may not be able to bring to pass the deed, yet they have the full purpose; and the unwavering purpose is to beEdition: current; Page: [128]accounted an act performed, for it never fails of its reward, here or in the next world."
"Though the wicked work their will, yet it availeth not; and their purpose is not lost to them, for they are punished for it here or elsewhere; such power hath their wicked will over them."
"They cannot compass the good they desire, for they seek it with the will, not by the right way."
The wicked will hath no fellowship with happiness.
"XXXVII

AFTER Philosophy had uttered this discourse, she began again to sing, and these were her words:

‘Hear now a tale of overproud and unrighteous kings."
"These we see seated on high seats; they are bright with many kinds of raiment, and are girt about with a great company of their thanes, who are decked with belts and golden-hilted swords and war dress of many kinds, threatening all mankind with their grandeur."
"And he that ruleth them recketh no more of friend or foe than doth a mad hound, but is unspeakably uplifted in mind by reason of his boundless power."
"But if thou strip off his clothes, and take away from him his company of thanes and his power, then shalt thou see that he is most like one of the thanes that minister unto him, if he be not even baser."
"And if it befall him that for a time he is reft of his servants, and his apparel, and his power, then it seemeth to himEdition: current; Page: [129]that he is brought to a dungeon or put in chains."
"For out of unmeet and inordinate apparelling, out of dainty meats and diverse drinks, the raging frenzy of lewd desire awakeneth and confoundeth men’s minds grievously."
"Then spring up also pride and frowardness; and, when they are swollen up, the mind is lashed with the surge of hot passion, until a man is bound about with gloom of soul, and held prisoner."
"When this hath come to pass, then the hope of revenge beginneth its lying tale to him, and his reckless mood promiseth whatsoever his passion craveth."
"I have already told thee in this very book that all creatures desire by their nature some good; but the unrighteous kings can do no good, for the reason I have just given thee."
"No marvel is it, for they put themselves in thraldom to all the sins I have already spoken of to thee."
"Such a one must obey the doom of those lords to whom he hath given himself over, and, what is worse, he will not even struggle against it."
"If he would but make a beginning, and should be unable afterwards to keep up the struggle, then would he bear no blame for it.’

P. 129."
"When Philosophy had sung this lay, she began again to discourse, and spake on this wise: ‘Dost thou now see in how great and deep and dark an abyss of sins men of evil desires are sunk, and how the good shine brighter than the sun?"
"For the good are never kept out of the rewards of their goodness, nor the wicked out of the punishments they earn."
"This is not at all unjust; even as once it was the custom of the Romans,Edition: current; Page: [130]and still is among many peoples, for a golden crown to be hung up at the end of a race-course; many men come together and all start level, as many as put their trust in their running."
And whosoever first reaches the crown may have it for himself.
"Each one desires to be first and have it, but it belongs to one only."
"So do all mankind in this present life; they run and hasten, longing for the Highest Good, which, however, is not allotted to one single man, but to all men."
Therefore it behoves every man to hasten with all his might after the prize; for from no good man shall it ever be withheld.
"He cannot rightly be called a good man who is deprived of the highest good, for no good quality fails to get good reward."
"Let the wicked do what they may, the crown of good meed shall be held by the good everlastingly."
No evil deed of the wicked can rob the good of their goodness and their beauty; but if these had their goodness outside themselves they could be stripped of it either by him who once gave it them or by some other.
A good man shall lose his reward when he shall lose his goodness.
"Understand therefore that to every man good meed is given by his own goodness—the goodness, that is, which is within him."
"What wise man will say that any good man is deprived of the highest good, because he is ever striving thereafter?"
"But bear thou ever in mind the great and goodly Reward, for it is to be loved beyond all other rewards, and add it to the afore-mentioned kinds of good that I told thee of in the third book."
"When they are all brought together, then mayest thou conceive that Edition: current; Page: [131]Happiness and the Highest Good are one and the same thing, even God."
"Then shalt thou also be able to perceive that every good man is blessed, and all blessed men are gods, and have eternal meed of their goodness."
"‘For these reasons no man need doubt that the wicked have likewise eternal meed of their wickedness, to wit, everlasting punishment."
"Though thou mayest think one or other of them happy here as the world goes, yet he hath ever his evil with him, and also the reward of his evil, so long as he takes pleasure therein."
"There is no wise man but knows that good and evil are ever at strife together, and diverse in purpose, and even as the good man’s goodness is his own good and his own meed, so also is the wicked man’s wickedness his own evil, his own reward, and his own punishment."
No man doubts that if he have punishment he has evil.
"Why do the wicked hope to escape their punishment, being full of every wickedness?"
"Not only are they filled therewith, but well-nigh brought to nothingness."
"Understand therefore by the case of the good how great the punishment the wicked always suffer, and listen to yet another example, while holding fast to that which I have already told thee."
"We say that everything that forms a single whole exists so long as it is one, and this united state we call good."
"For example, a man is a man so long as soul and body hold together; when they are parted he is no longer what he was before."
"Thou mayest perceive the same thing in the case of the body and its members; if any one of the members be missing, then there is not a perfect manEdition: current; Page: [132]as there was before."
"Furthermore, if any good man depart from goodness he is no longer quite good if he altogether depart therefrom."
"Hence it comes to pass that the wicked forsake that which they once did, and yet are not what they were before."
"But when they forsake what is good and become evil, then they become as nothing and have no likeness to anything."
"We can see that they once were men, but they have lost the best part of their man’s nature and kept the worst."
"They part with what is naturally good, to wit, the attributes of man, and yet keep the likeness of men as long as life lasts."
"‘But even as men’s goodness exalts them above the nature of men so that they are called gods, so also their wickedness drags them down beneath the nature of man so that they are called evil, and of evil we say that no such thing exists."
"If, therefore, thou meet a man grown so vile as to have turned from good to evil, thou canst not rightly call him a man, but a beast."
"If thou observe that a man is greedy and a robber, thou shalt not call him man, but wolf; and the fierce and froward thou shalt call hound, not man."
"The false and crafty thou shalt call fox, not man; him that is beyond measure savage and wrathful and over-passionate, thou shalt name lion, not man."
"The lazy one that is too slow, thou shalt call ass rather than man; and the over-timid one that is afraid more than he need be, thou mayest call hare rather than man."
"To the unsteady and frivolous thou mayest say that he is more like to the wind or the restless fowls of the air Edition: current; Page: [133]than to a steady-going man; and to him whom thou perceivest wallowing in his carnal lusts thou mayest say that he is most like unto fat swine that love always to lie in foul pools, and never care to wash themselves in clean water."
"When they are now and again made to bathe, they rush back afterwards to their filth and wallow in it.’

XXXVIII

P. 133."
"WHEN Philosophy had spoken this discourse she began to sing again, and these were her words: ‘I can from stories of old tell thee one that is very like unto what we are now discussing."
"Once upon a time, during the Trojan war, there lived, as it happened, a king named Aulixes (Ulysses), who held two countries under the Caesar."
"These countries were called Ithacige (Ithaca), and Retie (Rhaetia), and the Caesar’s name was Agamemnon."
"When Aulixes went with the Caesar to the war he had several hundred ships, and they were fighting about ten years."
"And when the king came from the Caesar homewards again and they had conquered the land he had no more than one ship, a three-banked galley."
"Then high winds and stormy seas beset him, and he was driven upon an island out in the Wendelsea (Mediterranean)."
"Now a daughter of Apollo, son of Job (Jove), dwelt there."
"Job was their king, and feigned that he was theEdition: current; Page: [134]highest god, and the silly folk believed him, for he was of the kingly clan, and in those days they knew no other god, but worshipped their kings for gods."
"Job’s father was also said to be a god; his name was Saturnus, and each of his sons likewise they accounted a god."
One of them was the Apollo we just now spoke of.
"Now Apollo’s daughter was, men say, a goddess whose name was Kirke (Circe)."
"She was said to be mighty in witchcraft, and dwelt in the island upon which the king we spoke of was driven."
"There she had a very great company of her thanes, and also of other maidens."
"No sooner did she look upon the shipwrecked king we have mentioned, whose name was Aulixes, than she fell in love with him, and each loved the other beyond all reason, so that for love of her he gave up all his kingdom and his kindred."
"And he tarried with her so long that his thanes could no longer stay with him, but, yearning for home and being minded to punish him, resolved to leave him."
"Now makers of fables started to make up a story, and said she changed the men with her witchcraft, and turned them into the shapes of wild beasts, and then cast upon them chains and fetters."
"One, they say, she changed into a lion, and when he should have spoken he roared."
"Some were boars, and when they should have been bemoaning their woes they grunted."
"Some became wolves, and howled when they should have spoken."
Some became the kind of beast we call tiger.
"Thus was all the crew changed into various kinds of beasts, each into some one or other, save only Edition: current; Page: [135]the king."
"They shunned every sort of food that men eat, and hungered after such as beasts feed on."
"They had no likeness to men in body or in voice, yet each had his reason as he had before."
Their reason was very sad for the miseries they were suffering.
"‘Now the men who believed these false tales knew that she could not with her witchcraft change men’s minds, though she changed their bodies."
Verily the power of the mind is great when measured with that of the body!
"By such ensamples thou mayest perceive that the power of the body heth in the mind, and every man is more harmed by the sins of his mind."
"The sins of the mind draw unto themselves the whole body, but the infirmity of the body cannot altogether draw in the mind.’

Then said I, ‘I grant that what thou saidst is true, namely, that it was not wrong to call men of wicked desires cattle or wild beasts, though they may have the likeness of men."
"Nevertheless, if I had power such as Almighty God has, I would not let the wicked harm the good as greatly as they now do.’

‘They are not,’ she said, ‘allowed to do so for as long a time as thou thinkest, but thou mayest understand that they are very speedily checked in their impunity, as I will forthwith prove to thee, although I have no time to spare for a fresh topic."
"If they had not the vain power they believe themselves to have, they would not suffer so great a penalty as they have to suffer."
"The wicked are ever more unhappy when they are able to carry out the evil they take delight in, Edition: current; Page: [136]than they are when they cannot do it, though foolish men may not believe it."
"’Tis bad that a man should wish to do evil, but it is far worse that he should be able to do it; for the evil will scatters like smoke before a fire if the deed cannot be accomplished."
"The wicked have at one time and another three sorts of unhappiness: the first is that they desire evil, the second is that they are capable of it, and the third that they bring it to pass; for God hath elected to bestow punishment and misery on wicked men for their deeds of evil.’

‘It is even as thou sayest,’ I said, ‘nevertheless I could wish, if possible, that they had not the unlucky power to do evil.’

‘I fancy, however,’ said she, ‘they lose the power sooner than thou couldst wish or than they themselves expect, for nothing in this present life is lasting, though men may think it long."
"Very often the mighty power of the wicked fails exceeding suddenly, even as a great tree in the forest falls with a loud crash when least expected; and it is from dread of this that they are always very miserable."
"If, therefore, it is their wickedness that makes them miserable, is not the evil that lasts long worse than that which is short-lived?"
Even if the wicked never died I should say that they weru the most miserable and unhappy of men.
"If all those miseries are real which we long ago said the wicked had to undergo in the world here, it is clear that these miseries are endless or eternal.’

‘What thou sayest,’ I said, ‘is wonderful and very Edition: current; Page: [137]hard for witless men to grasp; nevertheless I perceive that it is quite in keeping with our earlier discourse.’

‘I am not now speaking,’ said she, ‘to witless men, but to such as desire to get hold of wisdom; for it is a sign of wisdom when a man desires to hear it and lay hold of it."
"But if any foolish man doubt concerning any of the arguments we have used in this very book, then let him prove, if he be able, one thing or the other, either that one of the arguments is false or is not akin to the matter we are discussing, or, thirdly, let him understand and believe that we are on the right track."
"If he do none of these things, then he knows not his own mind."
"‘But I can show thee yet other things that foolish men will think even harder to believe, though it is quite in keeping with the argument we are carrying on.’

‘Why, what is that?’ I said."
"P. It is this, that the wicked, who suffer great misery and manifold punishment in this world for their sins, are far more unhappy than those who suffer no vengeance nor punishment in this world for their wickedness."
"Let no man, however, think I speak thus merely because I desire to blame vices and praise virtues, and to hold up this example as a warning to men and to draw them to virtue by the fear of punishment; it is for other reasons that I speak, and speak even more strongly."
"M. For what other reasons wouldst thou speak, over and above those that thou hast mentioned?"
"P. Dost thou remember what we were saying, that Edition: current; Page: [138]the good always had power and happiness, and the evil never had either?"
M. I do remember it.
P. What thinkest thou then?
"If thou seest a man very unhappy, and yet discernest some good in him, is he as unhappy as the man who has no whit of good in him?"
M. Him I count the happier that has some good.
"P. But what thinkest thou concerning him that hath no good, if he has some evil to boot?"
"Why, thou wilt say he is even more unhappy than the other, by reason of the added evil."
M. Am I not bound to think so?
"P. It is well that thou dost; and mark this with thy inmost mind, that the wicked have ever something good in the midst of their evil."
"This is their punishment, and this may well be accounted unto them for good."
But they whose wickedness goes all unpunished in this world are held by sin more grievous and more harmful than any punishment in this world.
"That their wickedness goes unpunished in this life is the clearest sign of the greatest sin in this world, and an earnest of the direst penalty hereafter."
M. This I cannot deny.
"P. The wicked are unhappier for being forgiven their sin when they deserve it not, than they whose sin is rewarded according to their deserts."
"For it is right that the wicked should be punished, and wrong that they be left unpunished."
M. Who gainsays this?
"Edition: current; Page: [139]

P. And no man can deny that what is right is altogether good, and what is wrong is wholly bad."
"M. I am sore perplexed by this manner of speaking, and I wonder that so righteous a Judge should be willing to give any gift that is not just."
P. What makes thee say that?
M. Because thou saidst He did wrong in suffering the wicked to go unpunished.
P. ’Tis His glory that He is so generous and giveth so freely; ’tis much that He granteth in biding until the wicked perceive their sin and turn towards good.
"M. Now I understand that it is not an everlasting grace that He granteth to the wicked, but a manner of delay and waiting for the Highest Judge."
"Methinks that for His delay and His patience He is the more unheeded; nevertheless I much like this manner of discourse, and it seems to go very well with what thou hast already said."
"But I entreat thee yet further to tell me whether thou thinkest the wicked have any punishment after this world, or the good any reward for their goodness."
"Then she said, ‘Have I not already told thee that the good have reward of their goodness, both here and for ever, and the wicked reward of their evil, both here and in eternity?"
"But I will now divide the wicked into two classes, for one part of them has everlasting punishment, having earned no mercy, and the other part shall be cleansed and refined in the heavenly fire, as silver is here."
"These, having deserved some measure of mercy, are allowed, after their troubles, to Edition: current; Page: [140]P. 140. come to eternal glory."
"Still further could I discourse to thee concerning the good and the wicked, if I had but time."
"But I dread lest I should lose sight of what we were seeking after, that is, our desire to convince thee that the wicked had honour neither in this world nor in the world to come."
"For thou wast of opinion that they had too much thereof, and didst think that a most fearful thing, and didst lament continually that they were under continual punishment; and I kept telling thee they were never free from punishment, though thou didst not think so."
But nevertheless I know thou wilt lament that they have leave to work wickedness during so long a space of time.
"I told thee that this space is a very short one, and moreover I tell thee that the longer it is the more unhappy they are, and their greatest unhappiness would be for it to last until doomsday."
"Further, I told thee that they whose wickedness was unjustly pardoned were unhappier than they whose wickedness was justly punished."
"Yet thou art to believe that they who are unchecked are more unhappy than they who have met with punishment.’

‘Nothing,’ said I, ‘ever seems to me so true as do thy words at the moment when I am listening to them."
"But if I turn to the opinion of the common folk, not only do they refuse to believe thy story, but even to listen to it.’

‘No marvel,’ she answered."
"‘Surely thou knowest that those men who have not sound eyes cannot gase with ease full upon the sun when he is shiningEdition: current; Page: [141]brightest, nor even on fire or on aught that is bright do they care to look, if the eyeball be diseased."
"Even so sinful minds are blinded with their wicked desire, so that they are unable to behold the light of the Bright Truth, that is to say, the Highest Wisdom."
"They are like fowls of the air and beasts that can see better by night than by day; for the day blinds and darkens their eyes, and the darkness of night lightens them."
"Therefore these purblind minds account it the greatest happiness that a man be allowed to work evil, and his deed to go unpunished; and for this reason they care not to follow up an inquiry until they discern what is right, but turn them to their unrighteous desires and go in quest thereof."
"I know not therefore what it avails for thee to show me unto foolish men, that never go in search of me."
"Not to these do I ever speak, but to thee, for thou art minded to track me out, and toilest harder than they do on the trail."
"I care not what they think; I set greater store on thine opinion than on theirs, for they are all gazing with both eyes, of the mind and of the body, on these things of the earth, and have their joy therein."
"But thou alone at times glancest with one eye at the things of heaven, whilst with the other thou art still looking at the things of earth."
"Fools think that everybody is as blind as themselves, and that none can see what they themselves cannot."
"This folly is as if a child were born quite healthy and well formed, and remained thriving in every excellence and virtue while still a child, and so throughout its youth, until he became perfect in everyEdition: current; Page: [142]faculty, and then not long before middle age became blind of both eyes, and likewise so blinded in the eyes of his mind as to remember nothing of what he had ever seen or heard, and yet should deem himself in every respect as perfect as he ever had been, regarding all men as like unto himself, and of the same way of thinking."
"He may be foolish enough to believe this, but are we going to think as he does?"
I do not think so; but I should like to know what thou thinkest of those men whom we spoke of and held to be more like beasts than men.
How much wisdom is theirs?
Methinks they have none.
"‘I would prove to thee yet another very true proposition, but I know the common folk will not believe it, namely, that they that are punished are happier than they that punish them.’

At this I marvelled, and said, ‘I wish thou wouldst make it plain to me how such can be the case.’

P. Dost thou perceive that every man that desires evil and does it is worthy of punishment?"
M. I perceive it quite clearly.
P. Is not he then a wisher and a worker of evil that punishes the innocent?
M. It is as thou sayest.
P. Dost thou think they that are worthy of punishment are miserable and unhappy?
M. I do not only think so; I know it full well.
"P. If thou hadst to decide, which wouldst thou deem the more worthy of punishment, him that punished the innocent, or him that suffered the penalty?"
"Edition: current; Page: [143]

M. The cases are not alike."
"I would help him that was without guilt, and chastise the man that had harmed him."
P. Then he that works evil seems to thee more wretched than he that suffers it?
"M. My belief is that every unjust punishment is a wrong in him that inflicts it, not in him that suffers it, for the wickedness of the first makes him wretched."
"I perceive that is a very just proposition thou layest down, and quite in keeping with what thou didst prove before; but yet I know the common folk do not think so."
"‘Thou hast a right understanding of the matter,’ she answered, ‘but pleaders at times defend them that have less need of them; they speak in behalf of those who are wronged, not of those that do the wrong."
"It were more needful for them that harm the innocent that some one should speak for them before those in authority, and demand that punishment should be inflicted upon them as great as the wrong they did to the innocent."
"Even as the sick man needs to be brought to the physician, to be tended by him, so he that works mischief needs to be taken before the magistrate that his vices may be cut out and burnt."
"I do not say it is wrong to help the innocent and plead his cause; but I say that it is better to bring the guilty man to judgement, and that the pleading does no good either to the wrong-doer or to him that pleads for him, if they desire that the wrong should not be punished according to the measure Edition: current; Page: [144]of the guilt."
"I am sure that if the guilty had but a spark of wisdom, and if they at all understood that they might atone for their sins by the punishment that befell them in this world, they would not call it punishment, but would say it was their cleansing and bettering."
"They would then seek no advocate, but would gladly suffer those in authority to illtreat them at their pleasure."
"We should not scourge a man that is sick and in pain, but should take him to the physician to be tended.’

XXXIX

AFTER Philosophy had spoken this discourse, she began once more to chaunt, and these were her words:

‘Why do ye men distract your minds with unrighteous hatred, even as the waves driven by the wind stir up the sea?"
Why do ye blame your fate for having no power?
"Why can ye not await Death in nature’s course, since he is day by day hastening towards you?"
Can ye not see that every day he pursueth birds and beasts and men?
"Alas, that unhappy men cannot wait for him to come to them, but go to meet him, even as wild beasts that seek to slay each other."
"But it is not right for men to hate one another; it were right that each should reward the other for every deed according to his deserving, loving the good man, as it is right we should do, and showing mercy to the wicked, as we said before."
"Let us love the man, butEdition: current; Page: [145]hate his sins, and cut them away as we are best able.’

When she had done singing this song, she was silent a little while."
"Then said I, ‘Now I see plainly that true happiness hinges on the merits of good men, and unhappiness on the deserts of the wicked."
"But I further say that I hold the joys of this present life to be no small blessing, and its sorrows no small evil, for I never yet saw nor heard of a wise man desiring to be outcast, poor, a stranger, and despised, rather than wealthy, honoured, powerful and famous in his own country."
"Accordingly, wise men say they can the more easily carry out and maintain their wisdom if their power be absolute over the people subject to them, and also in some measure over them that dwell near and round about them, saying that they are thus able to bring low the wicked and further the good."
"For the good man is ever worthy of honour, both in this present life and in the life to come; but the wicked man that cannot be held back from his wickedness is ever deserving of punishment, both in this world and in the next."
"But I marvel exceedingly why things fall out as they now often do, namely, that various punishments and manifold hardships come to the good, as they should do to the bad, and the blessings that should be the rewards of the good for their good deeds come to wicked men."
Therefore I would now learn from thee what thou thinkest of these ups and downs.
"I should marvel far less if I knew that it happened by chance, without Edition: current; Page: [146]God’s will and without His knowledge."
"But Almighty God hath increased mine awe and mine astonishment by these things, for at one time He giveth blessings to the good and unhappiness to the wicked, as it is right He should always do; at another time He suffereth the good to have unhappiness and ill luck in many things, and the wicked to have blessings and success after their own heart."
"Therefore I cannot conceive save that it happens thus by chance, unless thou explain it still more reasonably in another way.’

Then after a long while she made answer, and said, ‘No marvel is it that one should think everything of this kind happens without design, when he cannot make out and show why God allows it."
"But thou art not to doubt that so good a Creator and Ruler of all things hath fashioned aright all that He hath created, and judgeth and governeth all with justice, though thou know not why He doth it in this or in that way.’

After having uttered this discourse she began to sing, and these were her words:

Pp."
146-147.
"‘Which of the unlearned wondereth not at the course of the heavenly sphere and its swiftness, how every day it turneth round about all this earth?"
"Or who marvelleth not that some stars have a shorter journey round than others, as those stars have that we call the Wain Shafts?"
These have so short a journey round because they are so near to the northern end of the axle round which all this vault of heaven is turning.
"Or who marvelleth not at this, save onlyEdition: current; Page: [147]those who know the reason why, that some stars have a longer journey round than others have, and they have the longest that circle round the middle of the axle, even as Boeties (Bootes) doth, and Saturn, the star which comes not back to where it once was till thirty winters be passed?"
Who wondereth not that some stars journey under the sea?
"This some men think the sun doth, when he goeth to his setting, but he is no nearer the sea then than he was at midday."
"Who wondereth not when the full moon is overcast with darkness, or again, that the stars shine before the moon, but give no light before the sun?"
"At this they marvel, and at much of the same kind, yet do not marvel that men and all living things have a ceaseless and vain enmity among themselves."
"Or why do they not marvel that sometimes there is thunder, and at other times it is not heard?"
"Or again, why do they not wonder at the strife of sea and winds, of waves and land, or why ice formeth and afterwards in the sun’s glare returneth to its own kind?"
"The fickle folk marvel at what they see most seldom, though it be less a wonder, and think it is not of ancient creation, but hath newly arisen by chance."
"But they that become eager for knowledge and set themselves to learn, if God pluck away from their minds the folly with which they were covered before, cease to wonder at many things whereat they now are marvelling.’

When Philosophy had chaunted this lay, she was silent a little."
"Then said I, ‘It is even as thou sayest; but Edition: current; Page: [148]I would have thee show me somewhat more plainly concerning the thing that has troubled my mind most, concerning which I have already asked thee; for it has ever been thy wont to be willing to point out to every mind things secret and little known.’

At this she began to smile, and said unto me, ‘Thou art tempting me to the greatest of themes, and the hardest to explain."
"This explanation all philosophers have sought after and toiled at very earnestly, and scarcely any of them has come to a conclusion of the matter; for it is the nature of the discussion and inquiry that no sooner is one doubt settled than countless others are stirred up."
"It is like the serpent told of in the old story, that had nine heads, and, when one of them was struck off, seven more always grew where the one head had been."
"And it came to pass that the famous Erculus (Hercules), son of Job (Jove), came to it, and could not bethink himself how to overcome it by any wile, until he heaped firewood round it, and burnt it with fire."
"So it is with this subject thou art asking me about; a man can hardly get quit of it once he enters upon it; and he never reaches a clear conclusion, save he have an understanding keen as fire."
"For the man that would inquire into it must first know what the onefold providence of God is, and what Fate is, what happens by chance, and what are divine intelligence, divine predestination, and human freewill."
"Now, thou canst perceive how heavy and how difficult it is to explain all this; but nevertheless I will set to work Edition: current; Page: [149]P. 149. to teach thee somewhat, for I have noted that it is a powerful remedy for thy sorrow if thou understandest aught of this, though it be a long task for me to teach thee."
"For it is nigh unto the time when I had purposed to take other work in hand, and as yet I have not done with this; methinks also thou art a little tired and deemest these long arguments too wearisome, as though thou wouldst now be glad of some singing."
"I know thou desirest it, but thou must bear up for a time; I cannot now put it so soon into song, nor have I leisure for it, for it is a very long story.’

‘Do as thou wilt,’ I answered."
"Then she began to speak in a very remote and roundabout fashion, as though she were not alluding to the subject, and yet she led up to it, saying, ‘All creatures, both the seen and the unseen, the motionless and the moving, receive from the unmoving, unchanging, and undivided God their due order, form, and proportions; and, inasmuch as it was so created, He knoweth why He made all that He hath made."
Nothing of what He hath made is without use to Him.
"God ever dwelleth in the high city of His unity and mercy; thence He dealeth out ordinances many and various to all His creatures, and thence He ruleth them all."
"But regarding that which we call God’s providence and foresight, this exists as long as it abides with Him in His mind, ere it be brought to pass, and while it is but thought."
But as soon as it is accomplished we call it Fate.
"From this every man may know that Edition: current; Page: [150]Providence and Fate are not only two names, but two things."
"Providence is the Divine Reason, and lieth fast in the high Creator that knoweth how everything shall befall ere it come to pass."
"But that which we call Fate is God’s working day by day, both that which we see, and that which is not seen of us."
"The divine forethought holdeth up all creatures, so that they may not fall asunder from their due order."
"Fate therefore allots to all things their forms, places, seasons, and proportions; but Fate comes from the mind and the forethought of Almighty God, who worketh whatsoever He will according to His unspeakable Providence."
"‘Even as every craftsman thinks over and marks out his work in his mind ere he take it in hand, and then carries it out altogether, so this changing lot that we call Fate proceeds according to His forethought and purpose, even as He resolveth that it shall be done."
"Though it seem to us manifold, partly good, partly evil, yet it is to Him good, pure and simple, for He bringeth it all to a goodly conclusion, and doeth for good all that He doeth."
"When it is done, we call it Fate; before, it was God’s forethought and His purpose."
"Now Fate He setteth in motion by means of the good angels or the souls of men, or the lives of other creatures, or through the heavenly bodies, or the divers wiles of evil spirits; at one time through one of them, at another through all."
"But it is manifest that the divine purpose is single and unchanging, and rules everything in orderly wise, and gives unto all things their shape."
"Now some things in this world Edition: current; Page: [151]are subject to Fate, others are in no way subject; but Fate, and the things that are subject to her, are subject to divine Providence."
"Concerning this I can tell thee a parable, so that thou mayest the more clearly understand who are the men that are subject to Fate, and who are they that are not."
P. 151.
"‘All this moving and changing creation turns round the unmoving, the unchanging, and the undivided God, and He ruleth all creatures as He purposed in the beginning, and still doth purpose."
"The wheels of a waggon turn upon its axle, while the axle stands still and yet bears all the waggon and guides all its movement."
"The wheel turns round, and the nave next the wheel moves more firmly and securely than the felly does."
"Now the axle is as it were the highest good we call God, and the best men move next unto God just as the nave moves nearest the axle."
"The middle sort of men are like the spokes, for one end of each spoke is fast in the nave, and the other is in the felly; and so it is with the midmost man, at one time thinking in his mind upon this earthly life, at another upon the divine life, as if he looked with one eye heavenwards, and with the other earthwards."
"Just as the spokes have one end sticking in the felly and the other in the nave, while in the middle the spoke is equally near either, so the midmost men are at the middle of the spokes, the better sort nearer the nave, and the baser nearer the fellies, joined, however, to the nave, which in turn is fixed to the axle."
"Now, the fellies are fastened to the spokes, though they roll onEdition: current; Page: [152]the ground; and so the least worthy men are in touch with the middle sort, and these with the best, and the best with God."
"Though the worst men turn their love towards this world they cannot abide therein, nor come to anything, if they be in no degree fastened to God, no more than the wheel’s fellies can be in motion unless they be fastened to the spokes, and the spokes to the axle."
"The fellies are farthest from the axle, and therefore move least steadily."
"The nave moves nearest the axle, therefore is its motion the most sure."
"So do the best men; the nearer to God they set their love, and the more they despise earthly things, the less care is theirs, and the less they reck how Fate veers, or what she brings."
"So also the nave is ever sound, let the fellies strike on what they may; and nevertheless the nave is in some degree severed from the axle."
"Thereby thou mayest perceive that the waggon keeps far longer whole the less its distance from the axle, and so also those men are most free from care, both in this present life of tribulation and in the life to come, that are firmly fixed in God."
"But the farther they are sundered from God, the more sorely are they confounded and afflicted both in mind and in body."
"‘That which we call Fate is, compared to divine Providence, what reflexion and reason are when measured against perfect knowledge, and as things temporal compared with things eternal, or, again, like the wheel compared with the axle, the axle governing all the waggon."
"So with the forethought of God; it governeth the firmament and the stars, and maketh the Edition: current; Page: [153]earth to be at rest, and measureth out the four elements, to wit, water, earth, fire, and air."
"These it keepeth in peace; unto these it giveth form, and again taketh it away, changing them to other forms and renewing them again."
"It engendereth everything that groweth, and hideth and preserveth it when old and withered, and again bringeth it out and reneweth it when it pleaseth."
"Some sages, however, say that Fate rules both weal and woe of every man."
"But I say, as do all Christian men, that it is the divine purpose that rules them, not Fate; and I know that it judges all things very rightly, though unthinking men may not think so."
"They hold that all are good that work their will, and no wonder, for they are blinded by the darkness of their sins."
"But divine Providence understandeth it all most rightly, though we in our folly think it goes awry, being unable to discern what is right."
"He, however, judgeth all aright, though at times it seems to us otherwise."
"‘All men, both good and bad, are seeking after the Highest Good; but the wicked cannot come to the roof-tree of all things good because they seek not rightly thereafter."
"Perhaps thou wilt now say to me, “What wrong can be greater than to allow it to happen, as it does at times happen, that unmixed evil befalls the good in this world, and good unalloyed comes to the wicked, while at other times the lots of both good and wicked are intermingled?” But I ask thee whether thou thinkest anybody is so shrewd as to be able to discern the nature of every man, so that he be neither Edition: current; Page: [154]better nor worse than the other judges him to be?"
"Why, I know this cannot be, for often a habit is wrongly judged, of which some men say it is worthy of reward, and others that it is worthy of punishment."
"Though one may perceive what another does, he cannot know what he thinks; though he may be able to learn part of his will, he cannot learn it all."
"I can readily show thee an example whereby thou mayest understand it more clearly, though undiscerning men cannot understand it."
"Why does a good physician give to one healthy man a mild and sweet drink, and to another a bitter and strong one; and again, in the case of sick men, to one mild drink and to another strong, to one sweet and to another bitter?"
"I know everybody that is ignorant of the craft will marvel why they do so; but the physicians do not marvel at all, for they know that which the others know not, namely, how to discern and know apart their diseases, and likewise the means wherewith to combat them."
Now what is the soul’s health but righteousness?
What is its disease but wicked ways?
"Who, therefore, is a better physician of the soul than He that created it, even God?"
"He showeth honour to the good, and punisheth the wicked."
"He knoweth what reward each deserves, and it is no wonder, for He beholdeth it all from the roof on high, and thence He mixeth and measureth out to each according to his deeds."
"‘This, then, we call Fate, when the discerning God that knoweth every man’s need worketh or suffereth aught that we do not look for."
"I can in a few words Edition: current; Page: [155]P. 155. give thee yet another example whereby man’s reason may apprehend the divine nature, that is to say, the case where we judge a man in one way and God judges him in another."
"Sometimes we think he is better, but God knows he is not so."
"When aught of good or evil befalls a man in greater measure than thou thinkest he deserves, it is not God’s unrighteousness but thy dullness not to be able to discern it aright."
Yet it oft comes to pass that men judge a man in the same way as God judgeth him.
"Often it happens that many men are so infirm, both in mind and body, that they are not able to do any good, nor desire, if they can help it, to do evil, and are also so restive that they can bear no suffering with patience."
"Therefore it often happens that God in His loving-kindness will not lay too grievous an affliction upon them, lest they forsake their harmlessness and grow worse if checked and afflicted."
"Some are fully possessed of every virtue, right holy and just men, and such God thinketh it wrong to afflict; yea, even death, which all men have by their nature to suffer, He maketh more gentle to them than to other men."
"The wise man of old said that the divine power sheltered its loved ones under the spread of its wings, and shielded them as carefully as a man shields the apple of his eye."
"Many strive to please God, desiring of their own will to suffer many hardships, for they seek to have greater honour and repute and credit with God than those whose lives are softer."
"Power in this world also often comes to very good men, to the end that the might of the wicked be Edition: current; Page: [156]destroyed."
"To some men God giveth both good and evil mingled, for they deserve of either; some He bereaveth very soon of their wealth in which they are most happy, lest for over-long happiness they exalt them beyond measure and pass thence to pride."
"Others He suffereth to be oppressed with sore affliction, that they may learn the virtue of patience during their long hardship."
"Some men dread tribulation more than they need, though they are able to bear it with ease; others buy honourable reputation in this present life by their own death, thinking they have nothing to buy fame with save their own lives."
"Some men have been in days gone by unconquerable, so that none could subdue them with any torture; and these were an example to their successors not to be mastered by it."
In them it was manifest that by reason of their good deeds they had the virtue of being unconquerable.
"But the wicked for their evil deeds were punished and subdued, that their chastisement, while deterring others from doing the like, might lead to repentance those whom it was afflicting at the time."
"This is a very clear token to the wise man that he is not to love worldly happiness beyond measure, for often it comes to the worst of men."
But what are we to say of the present well-being that often comes to the good man?
"What else is it but a token of the weal to come, and a beginning of the reward that God hath in store for him in return for his good will?"
I think also that God gives happiness to many wicked men because He knoweth their nature and their will to be such that they Edition: current; Page: [157]are none the better but only the worse for any affliction.
"But the good physician, even God, healeth their minds with riches, wishing them to understand whence the well-being comes to them, and to court Him lest He part them and their wealth, and to turn their ways unto good and forswear their sins and the wickedness they once did in their adversity."
"Some, however, are the worse if they have wealth, for they are overweening for it and revel in it out of measure."
‘Many men also are given worldly wealth that they may reward the good for their goodness and the wicked for their wickedness.
"For the good and the wicked are ever at odds, and sometimes also the wicked fall out among themselves."
"Yea, even a single wicked man is always in conflict with himself, for he knows that he does wrong, and knows what reward to look for, but will not cease from it nor even allow himself to repent thereof, and then, being in constant dread, cannot be at peace with himself."
"Often also it happens that the wicked man gives up his wrong-doing out of wrath at another man’s misdeed, wishing to rebuke the other by shunning his ways."
"Then he strives with all his might, endeavouring to be unlike the other, for ’tis the wont of the divine power to work good out of evil."
"But no man is allowed to know all that God hath purposed, nor yet to explain what He hath made."
"It suffices him therein to know that the Creator and Ruler governeth all things, and rightly fashioned all that He hath created, and hath wrought no evil nor yet worketh it, but driveth away every wrong from Edition: current; Page: [158]His kingdom."
"But if thou wilt inquire into the high power of Almighty God, then thou wilt perceive evil in nothing, though now there seems to thee much evil here on this earth."
"Therefore it is right that the good should have an excellent reward of their goodness, and that the wicked should have punishment for their wrong-doing."
"That which is right is not evil, but good."
"But I perceive that I have wearied thee with this long discourse, for now thou wouldst fain hear a song."
"Well then, hear one, for ’tis the medicine and the drink thou hast long been craving, so that thou mayest the more readily receive my teaching.’

After Philosophy had uttered this discourse she began once more to sing, and her words were on this wise:

‘If thou desire with clear mind to apprehend the high Power, behold the luminaries of the high heavens."
"These bodies keep up the ancient peace wherein they were created, so that the fiery sun toucheth not that part of the heavens where the moon journeyeth, nor doth the moon touch the part where the sun runneth, as long as he is there."
"The star we call Ursa never cometh into the west, though all other stars journey with the heavenly sphere after the sun round the earth."
"This is no marvel, for it is very nigh unto the upper end of the axle."
"But the star we call the evening star, when seen in the west, betokeneth eventide."
Then it passeth with the sun into the earth’s shadow until it overtaketh the sun from behind and riseth in front of him.
"Then we call it the morning star, forEdition: current; Page: [159]it riseth in the east, and bodeth the sun’s coming."
"The sun and the moon have parted between them day and night in even degree, and reign most peacefully through the divine foresight, and will serve Almighty God unweariedly till the day of doom."
"God suffereth them not to be both in one quarter of the heavens, lest they destroy other creatures."
But the peace-loving God ordereth all things and atoneth them that are in conflict.
"Now wet shunneth dry; now He mingleth fire with cold; the light and bright fire flieth upwards, and the heavy earth abideth beneath."
"By the King’s command earth bringeth forth every fruit and growing thing year by year, and the hot summer drieth and getteth ready seeds and fruits, and fruitful autumn bringeth them to ripeness."
"Hail and snows and oft-falling rain wet the earth in winter, and the earth receiveth the seed and maketh it to grow in the spring."
"But the Lord of all things feedeth in the earth all growing crops and bringeth them all forth, hiding them when it pleaseth Him, making them to appear when He will, and taking them away when He will."
"While creatures are ministering unto Him, the Highest Creator sitteth upon His high seat, whence He wieldeth all things with His guiding reins."
"’Tis no marvel, for He is King, and Master, and Wellspring, and Beginning, and Law, and Wisdom, and Righteous Judge."
"He sendeth all creatures on His errands, and biddeth them all return."
"If the one unchanging King had not stablished all things created, they would all have fallen and burst asunder and come to naught."
Edition: current; Page: [160]Nevertheless they have one thing in common—their single love in the serving of such a Master; and they rejoice that He ruleth them.
"No wonder is it, for they could not be at all, did they not serve their Maker.’

XL

THEN Philosophy ceased from her singing and said unto me: ‘Dost thou now perceive whither this discourse is tending?’

‘Tell me,’ I answered, ‘whither.’

P. I will say this to thee, that every fate is good, whether men think it good or bad."
"M. Methinks it may easily be so, though we may at times deem otherwise."
"P. There is no doubt that every fate is good that is just and profitable; for every lot, be it pleasant or unpleasant, cometh to the good man either to constrain him to do better than he did before, or to reward him for having done well before."
"Again, every lot that befalls the wicked man comes to him also for these two reasons, whether his lot be a harsh or a pleasant one."
"If a hard lot befalls the wicked, then it comes as a reward of his wickedness, or as a rebuke and warning to him not to do it again."
"At this I fell to wondering, and said: ‘This is a most truly just reasoning of thine.’

P. It is as thou sayest; but I desire, if it please thee, that we should turn for a while to the opinion Edition: current; Page: [161]of the common folk, lest they say we speak above man’s measure."
M. Say as thou wilt.
P. Dost thou think that what is useful is good?
M. I think it is.
P. Every lot is useful that instructs or punishes.
M. That is true.
P. An adverse lot is good for those that are fighting against sins and striving to be good.
M. I cannot gainsay this.
"P. What thinkest thou of the good fortune that often befalls good men in this world, like a foretoken of everlasting good?"
Can men say it is an evil fate?
"At this I smiled and said, ‘No man says so, but says it is very good, as indeed it is.’

P. What thinkest thou concerning the unlooked-for fate that often threatens to chastise the wicked?"
Do people think it is good fortune?
"M. No, they do not deem it good, but miserable."
P. Let us refrain from thinking as the common folk think; for if we think as they do we shall forsake all reason and all righteousness.
M. Why do we forsake it any the more?
"P. Because ordinary men say that every harsh and unlovely lot is evil; but we must not believe this, for every lot is good, as we said before, be it harsh, or be it pleasing."
"At this I was afraid, and said: ‘What thou sayest Edition: current; Page: [162]is true; yet I know not who would dare to say so to foolish men, for no fool could believe it.’

Hereupon Philosophy made earnest protest, and said: ‘No wise man therefore should take thought nor trouble himself over-much as to how his lot will turn out, or whether a hard or a gentle fate is to befall him, any more than a stout man-at-arms should trouble himself how often he is to fight."
"His praise is none the less, nay, is doubtless the greater; so also is the wise man’s meed the greater, the fiercer and crueller the fate that befalls him."
"No wise man therefore should desire a life of ease, if he cares aught for virtue or any honour in this world here, or for life everlasting after this world."
"But every wise man must ever resist both harsh and mild fortune, lest for the one he wax over-confident and for the other come to despair."
"He must rather follow the middle way between a hard fate and a mild one, so that he crave not a gladder lot and greater ease than is meet; nor again a harsh one, for of neither is he able to endure an excessive measure."
But which of the two they shall choose lies in their own power.
"If therefore they desire to take the middle path, they must allot themselves a pleasant and care-free fortune, and then God will deal out to them a lot of hardship both in this world and in the world to come, according to what they are able to bear."
P. 162.
‘Ah!
"ye wise men; walk, all of you, in the way pointed out by the famous examples of the noble ones and the ambitious men that lived before you!"
"Why will ye not inquire after the wise men and those thatEdition: current; Page: [163]coveted honours, what manner of men they were that came before you?"
"And why will ye not, when ye have found out their manner of life, copy them with might and main?"
"For they strove after honour in this world and set themselves to win good report with good works, and wrought a goodly ensample for those that came after."
"Therefore by virtue of their good deeds they now are dwelling above the ‘stars in bliss everlasting.’

Here endeth the fourth book of Boethius, and beginneth the fifth."
"After Philosophy had held this discourse, I said: ‘Very true is thy teaching; but I would remind thee of the manifold doctrine thou didst promise me concerning the foreordained purpose of God."
"But I would first know from thee whether there is anything in what we often hear men say about certain things, that they happen by chance.’

P. I would rather hasten on to make good my earlier promise to thee, and point out to thee the very shortest way I can find to thy native land."
"But it is indeed far from our way, from the way we have chosen to follow."
"It were therefore more profitable to turn to that concerning which thou hast asked me, and to get to understand it."
"But I dread to lead thee hither and thither into bypaths away from thy road, so that thou mayest not be able to find the way again."
"P. I will teach thee by parables, as I have all along done; and yet I will say this, that there is nothing in that which men say, to wit, that a thing happens by chance."
"For each thing comes from some thing, and so does not happen by chance; whereas if it came from nothing it would happen by chance."
M. But whence came the name in the first place?
P. My favourite Aristotle treated of it in the book called Fisica (Physica).
M. How did he treat of it?
"P. Men used formerly to say, when anything unlooked for took place, that it happened by chance; just as if a man were to dig in the earth, and find a gold-hoard there, and then said it happened by chance."
"Why, I know that if the delver had not dug the earth, and no man had hid the gold beforehand, he would not have found it."
"Therefore it was not found by chance; but the divine predestination instructed him that it wished to hide the gold, and afterwards him that it wished to find it."
"Then said I, ‘I perceive that it is as thou sayest; but I would ask thee whether we have any freedom or any power as to what we shall do, or what we shall not do; or does the divine foreordaining or Fate compel us to will?’

P. We have great power, and there is no reasoning creature but has freedom."
He that has reason can judge and discern what he is to desire and what he Edition: current; Page: [165]must shun.
"Every man has freedom, inasmuch as he knows what he wishes, and what he does not wish; yet not all reasoning creatures have like freedom."
"Angels have power to judge aright and a good purpose, and all that they desire they get with great ease, for they desire nothing wrong."
Nothing has freedom and reason save angels and men.
"Men have always the more freedom the nearer to divine things they set their thoughts, and have the less freedom the closer they apply their minds’ desire to worldly honours."
They have no freedom when of their own will they bow themselves to vices; for as soon as they turn their minds from God they become blinded with folly.
"Howbeit, there is one God Almighty in His high city, who seeth every man’s thoughts, and discerneth his words and his deeds, and rewardeth each according to his deserving."
"XLI

P. 165."
"WHEN Philosophy had spoken this discourse she fell to singing, and these were her words:

‘Though Homer the good poet, that was best among Greeks, and Firgilius’ (Virgil’s) teacher—Firgilius was the best among the Laedenwara (Latins)—though Homer in his lays greatly praised the sun’s nature, and his powers, and his brightness, yet the sun cannot shine upon all things, nor even, Edition: current; Page: [166]in those things that it can shine upon, is he able to shine upon them all alike, nor to shine through them within."
"But it is not thus with Almighty God, that is the Creator of all things."
"He seeth and gazeth into all His creatures equally, and He may without untruth be called the True Sun.’

When Philosophy had sung this song, she was silent a little while."
"Then said I, ‘A doubt has sorely perplexed me.’

P. What is it?"
M. It is this.
"Thou sayest God gives to each man free choice to do as he pleases, whether good or evil, and thou sayest also that God knoweth everything before it comes to pass; further thou sayest nothing happens unless God will or suffer it, and lastly thou sayest that all must turn out as He hath appointed."
"Now I marvel why He suffereth wicked men to have freedom to do good or evil at will, when He knoweth beforehand that they will do evil."
P. 166.P.I can answer this point very easily.
"How would it please thee if there were an exceeding mighty king that had no free man in all his realm, but all were slaves?"
"M.I should think it unjust, and not at all seemly, if he were served by slaves."
P.Yet it were still more unmeet if God had in all His kingdom no free creature under His rule.
"For He created two reasonable creatures free, angels and men; to them He gave the great gift of freedom, that they might do good or evil, whichever they pleased.Edition: current; Page: [167]P. 167.To every man until his end He hath given an abiding grace, and with the grace an abiding law; that is, freedom to do what he will, and the law whereby He rewardeth each according to his deeds, both in this world and in the world to come, with good or evil, according as the man acts."
"Men may by virtue of this freedom compass whatsoever they please, but Death they cannot escape."
"Still, they can keep him back with good deeds, so that he comes later; yea, at times they put him off even until old age."
"If it be not in a man’s power to do a good deed, let him have the good intent, which is equally good."
M.Thou hast much comforted me in the doubt and perplexity I was in concerning this freedom.
"But I am still in much greater doubt, and sad wellnigh to despair."
P.What is this great sorrow?
"M.It is about God’s foreordaining, for we hear it said at times that all must come to pass as God in the beginning purposed, so that no man can change it."
"Now, I think He doeth amiss when He showeth favour unto the good, and also when He chastiseth the wicked, if it be true that they are so made as to be unable to act otherwise."
"Vain is our labour when we pray, and fast, or give alms, if we have no more credit for it than those that in all things follow their own will, and run after their carnal pleasure."
"Then said she, ‘This is the old complaint thou hast long been sounding, and many other men before thee."
"One of them was Marcus, whose second nameEdition: current; Page: [168]was Tullius, and who was called Cicero by a third name—he was a Roman chieftain, and a sage."
"He was greatly troubled with this very question, but could not bring it to any issue."
The reason why neither he nor any man of that time could bring the question to any issue was because their minds were busied with desires of this world.
"But I tell thee that if what men say be true, then it was a vain commandment that God gave in the holy books that man should forswear evil and do good; and also where He said: “The more a man toileth, the greater the reward he shall receive.” I marvel that thou hast forgotten all we said before.’

‘What,’ I said, ‘have I forgotten, that we said before?’

Then said she, ‘We said that the divine purpose made all good and nothing evil, neither seeking to do evil nor ever doing it."
"Yea, we accounted that good which seemed evil to the common folk, namely, that a man is punished and chastised for his sin."
"Have we not also said in this very book that God purposed to bestow freedom upon men, and did so; and, if they used this freedom aright, that He would greatly honour them with life everlasting, and, if they misused their freedom, that He would punish them with death?"
"He purposed that if they were guilly of any sin in this state of freedom they should atone for it in the free state with repentance; and that, if any one among them were so hard of heart as to repent not, he should suffer due punishment."
"All creatures He had designedEdition: current; Page: [169]to be without freedom, save angels and men."
"Inasmuch as other creatures are not free, they keep on with their ministry until the day of judgement; but men and angels, being free, dispense with service."
What is there that men can say the divine purpose has resolved upon and not carried out?
"Or how can they say in excuse that they cannot do good, when it is written that God rewards each man according to his works?"
"Why should any man therefore be idle, and not work?’

M.Thou hast quite freed me from my mind’s doubt as to the question I put to thee."
But I would further ask thee of another matter that makes me doubt.
P.What is it?
"M.I know sufficiently well that God knoweth all beforehand, both good and evil, ere it come to pass; but I am not sure whether all that he knoweth and hath resolved shall all take place irrevocably."
"P.It need not all take place irrevocably, but part of it must so happen, namely, that which is necessary for us and willed by Him."
"Some things, however, are of such a nature that there is no need for them, yet there is no harm in their happening, nor again in their not happening."
"Bethink thyself in thine own case whether thou hast ever resolved upon any thing so firmly that it seems to thee never capable of change, and that thou canst not do without it; or again, thou mayest be so uncertain in any course that it matters not to thee whether it take place or not."
"Many aEdition: current; Page: [170]thing God knows of before it happens, and which He knows will harm His creatures if it happen."
"He knows it, not because He wishes it to happen, but because He wishes to prevent it from happening, even as a good steersman, by the raging of the sea, is aware of a great wind ere it come."
"He bids furl the sail and sometimes lower the mast, and let go the cables, and by making fast before the foul wind he takes measures against the storm."
"Then said I, ‘Greatly hast thou helped me in the matter, and I marvel why so many wise men have been at such pains therein and found so little certainty.’

‘Why dost thou marvel thereat,’ she said, ‘when it is so easy to understand?"
"Knowest thou not that many things are not perceived as they really are, but in accordance with the measure of the understanding that inquires into them?"
"Now Wisdom is of such kind that no man of this world can conceive her as she really is; but each strives according to the measure of his wit to understand her, if he may."
"But Wisdom is able to perceive us exactly as we are, though we may not be able to perceive her exactly as she is; for Wisdom is God."
"He beholdeth all our works, both good and evil, before they come to pass, before even they arise in thought; but He doth not any the more constrain us so that we are obliged to do good, nor hinder us from doing wrong, for He hath given us freedom."
"I can show thee an example, so that thou mayest the more easily understand the argument."
"Lo Edition: current; Page: [171]now, thou knowest that sight and hearing and feeling perceive a man’s body and yet do not apprehend it alike."
"The ears perceive what they hear, and yet do not altogether apprehend the body as it really is; touch may grope and feel that it is a body, but it cannot feel if it be black or white, fair or foul."
"But the sight, in the first moment that the eyes look upon it, takes in the whole form of the body."
"But I would show thee yet another argument, that thou mayest know what thou didst marvel at.’

‘What is it?’ I said."
"Then said she, ‘It is this, that a man perceives separately what he discerns in another man; he perceives him separately with the eyes, separately with the ears, and separately by his imagination, reason, and intuition."
"There are many living creatures without motion, such as shell-fish, that nevertheless have a certain measure of reason, for they could not live if they had no jot of it."
"Some are able to see, some to hear, some to feel, others to smell."
"But moving creatures are more like unto men, for they all have not only that which creatures without movement have, but more to boot; they are like men in loving what they love, hating what they hate, shunning what they abhor, and seeking what they love."
"Now men have all that we have said, and in addition the mighty gift of reason, while angels have unerring intelligence (intuition)."
"Creatures are thus made to the end that those without movement may not exalt themselves above those that move, nor strive with them; and thatEdition: current; Page: [172]moving creatures may not rise above men, nor men above angels, nor angels above God."
"It is pitiful that the greater part of men seek not after that which has been given them, to wit, reason, nor seek that which is above them, possessed by angels and wise men, that is to say, intuition."
But most men do like beasts in that they desire worldly delights like beasts.
"If, however, we had any portion of the unhesitating understanding that angels have, we might perceive that this understanding is far better than our reason."
"Though we think upon many things, we have but little perfect understanding free from doubt; but the angels have no doubt concerning any of the things they know, for their perfect knowledge is as much better than our reason, as our reason is better than the understanding of beasts or any part of the wit vouchsafed them, whether to those that move or to those that move not."
"But let us raise our minds as high as we can towards the crowning point of the highest intelligence, that thou mayest most speedily and easily come to thine own home whence thou didst once issue."
"There thy mind and thy reason may see clearly everything that is now in doubt, both as touching the divine foresight whereof we have often spoken, and concerning our freedom, and all things besides.’

After Philosophy had spoken this discourse, she began to sing, and these were her words:

‘Lo!"
thou mayest perceive that there are many creatures moving over the ground most diverse in form and movement.
"Some lie with the whole body on Edition: current; Page: [173]the ground and move by creeping, so that neither feet nor wings help them; others are two-footed, others four-footed, others again flying, yet all are bent down towards the ground and seek there whatsoever they desire or need."
"But man alone walketh upright; and this is a token that he shall turn his thoughts rather upwards than downwards, lest the mind be lower than the body.’

XLII

AFTER Philosophy had sung this lay, she said: ‘We ought with all our might to inquire about God, that we may know what He is."
"Though it be beyond our power to know what He is, yet we must try to know, according to the measure of the understanding He giveth us; even as we said before that a man should understand everything in the measure of his understanding, seeing that we cannot perceive each thing as it really is."
"Every creature, however, both reasoning and unreasoning, declares that God is eternal, for never would so many creatures and so mighty and so fair have bowed themselves to a lesser creature and a lesser power than themselves, nor even to one equally great.’

‘What is eternity?’ I said."
"Then said she, ‘Thou askest me a thing that is great and hard to understand; if thou wilt know it, thou must first have thine eyes clean and bright.Edition: current; Page: [174]I cannot hide from thee aught that I know."
Dost thou know that there are three things on this earth?
"The first lasts for a time only, and has both beginning and end; yet I know nothing of that which lasts for a time, neither its beginning nor its end."
"The second thing is eternal, and has beginning but no end; of this I know when it begins, and I know that it never ends; such are angels and men’s souls."
"The third thing is eternal, without end and without beginning, even God."
"Between these three there is a great difference, but if we are to note every point thereof we shall come late to the end of this book, or never at all."
"One thing thereof, however, thou hast need to know, and that is, why God is called the Highest Eternity.’

‘Why indeed?’ I said."
"‘Inasmuch as we know,’ said she, ‘very little of what was before us save by memory and asking, and still less of what shall be after us, that only is with certainty present to us which exists at the time."
"But to God all is present, both that which was before and that which is now, yea, and that which shall be after us; all is present to Him."
"His wealth never waxeth, nor doth it ever wane."
"He never calleth aught to mind, for He hath never forgotten aught."
"He looketh for naught, pondereth naught, for He knoweth all."
"He seeketh nothing, for He hath lost nothing."
"He pursueth no creature, for none may flee from Him; nor doth He dread aught, for there is none more mighty, nor even like unto Him."
"He is ever giving,Edition: current; Page: [175]yet He never waneth in aught."
"He is ever almighty, for He ever willeth good and never evil."
He needeth nothing.
"He is ever watching, never sleeping."
He is ever equally kind.
"He is ever eternal, for the time never was when He was not, nor ever shall be."
"He is ever free, and not compelled to do any work."
By virtue of His divine power He is everywhere present.
"His greatness no man can measure; yet this is to be conceived not as of the body but as touching the spirit, like wisdom and righteousness, which He is Himself."
"But why do ye men show pride, why raise yourselves against so high a power?"

"However, he has made up for this on p. 16, where he makes Worldly Happiness speak."
"Alfred omits a passage about Paullus shedding tears over the misfortunes of King Perseus, his prisoner; and also an allusion (in Greek) to the two jars standing at the threshold of Zeus, one full of blessings, the other of calamities."
"Alfred was probably led into the error of mistaking Catullus the poet for Catulus by the reading of his copy of Boethius, as a MS. still exists with the reading Catulus."
But his commentary would have told him that the poet was meant.

"Alfred here mistakes the meaning of the Latin Decoratus, the name of one of the chief accusers of Boethius."
"One of these natures is, &c. This is from a commentary, where it is explained that by the words of Boethius triplicis naturae media anima must be understood anima rationabilis, anima irascibilis, and anima concupiscibilis."
"How then can any man, &c. Alfred has mistaken the sense of the Latin, Nam cur rogati sponte recta censetis."
"Also Plato’s doctrine is summarized by Boethius in the words Quod quisque discit, immemor recordatur."
"Alfred continually plays on the words ‘God’ and ‘good,’ which were often written alike in Anglo-Saxon, though pronounced differently, ‘God’ having probably its modern pronunciation, and ‘good’ approximately the modern pronunciation of ‘goad.’

I can answer this point very easily, &c. Henceforward to the end of the book Alfred entirely recasts his original."
"Boethius’ language becomes abstract and difficult, and could hardly have been rendered even freely into the English of Alfred’s day."
"Skin infections generally occur at the sites of skin damage produced by, for example, atopic dermatitis, burns, cracks in the skin, cuts, blisters, insect bites, surgical wounds, intravenous drug injection or sites of intravenous catheter insertion, or long-term usage of topical steroids."
"The skin infections may be localized or diffuse with severe inflammation of the epidermal, dermal and sub-cutaneous layers of the skin."
"They may be caused by various microbes including, but not limited to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Herpes simplex virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, and fungi such as Microsporum spp."
and Trichophyton spp.
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic/relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense pruritus (e.g., severe itch) and by scaly and dry eczematous lesions."
AD is often associated with other atopic disorders such as allergic rhinitis and asthma.
"Patients with atopic dermatitis are susceptible to serious skin infections caused by bacteria and viruses including, but not limited to S. aureus and herpes simplex virus."
"S. aureus causes severe localized and diffuse (e.g., impetigo) skin infections."
S. aureus colonization and infections of lesions significantly impacts AD disease activity and severity.
"Typical treatments include topical lotions and moisturizers, antibiotics, anti-viral and anti-fungal agents."
"Most treatment options, however, offer only temporary, incomplete, symptom relief."
"Moreover, in many patients with moderate-to-severe AD, prolonged use of topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors may lead to increased risk of skin microbial infections."
"Thus, a need exists in the art for novel targeted therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of skin infections."

title: Utility based pricing and hedging of jump diffusion processes with a view to applications
---

Introduction
============

The applicability of the Black–Scholes framework for the pricing and hedging of derivative claims crucially depends on the assumption of market completeness, i.e., the possibility to replicate claims and thus eliminate risk."
This assumption is not fulfilled if the asset process is driven by more than one source of risk or when market imperfections such as transaction costs are not negligible.
"One then speaks of an incomplete market in which investors may attribute different prices to derivatives, according to their risk preferences."
"As an example, let us consider a jump diffusion process, i.e., the asset $S$ evolves according to $$\label{eq:AssetProcess}
    {\mathrm{d}}S_t = \mu S_{t_-} {\mathrm{d}}t + \sigma S_{t_-} {\mathrm{d}}W_t + (e^{J_t} - 1) S_{t_-} {\mathrm{d}}N_t.$$ Here $W_t$ is a Wiener and $N_t$ a Poisson process with frequency $\lambda$."
The random variable $J_t$ determines the relative size $e^{J_t}-1$ of the jump.
The oldest and probably most popular approach for the pricing and hedging of a claim on such an asset is Merton’s [@Merton].
"There, the investor sets up a portfolio $\Pi$ consisting of the claim with value $V$ and a quantity $- \Delta$ of assets, so that the evolution of the portfolio is given by $$\begin{aligned}
    {\mathrm{d}}\Pi_t = & \ {\mathrm{d}}V_t - \Delta_t {\mathrm{d}}S_t \nonumber \\
\label{eq:Portfolio}
                        = & \left( {\partial}_t V_t(S_t) + \mu S_{t} {\partial}_S V_t(S_{t}) + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} S^2_{t} {\partial}_S^2 V_t(S_{t}) - \Delta_t \mu S_{t} \right) {\mathrm{d}}t \\
                            & + \sigma S_{t} \left\{ {\partial}_S V_t(S_{t}) - \Delta_t \right\} {\mathrm{d}}W_t  + \left\{ V_t(e^{J_t} S_{t}) - V_t(S_{t}) - \Delta_t (e^{J_t}-1) S_{t} \right\} {\mathrm{d}}N_t \nonumber\end{aligned}$$ It is in general not possible to eliminate jump and diffusion risk at the same time, so some “optimal” choice is necessary."
"Merton’s proposal is to hedge only the diffusion risk and to diversify the jump risk, i.e., to set $\Delta_t = {\partial}_S V_t$."
"The above then yields $$\begin{aligned}
    {\mathrm{d}}\Pi_t = & \left( {\partial}_t V_t(S_t) + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} S^2_{t} {\partial}_S^2 V_t(S_{t})  \right) {\mathrm{d}}t  \\
                            & + \left\{ V_t(e^{J_t} S_{t}) - V_t(S_{t}) - (e^{J_t}-1) S_{t} {\partial}_S V_t(S_t)\right\} {\mathrm{d}}N_t.\end{aligned}$$ If jump risk is diversified, the investor does not need any risk premium for taking this risk, i.e., the expected value of ${\mathrm{d}}\Pi_t$ should vanish."
"Thus, we obtain the partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) $$\begin{gathered}
\label{eq:MertonPIDE}
0 = {\partial}_t V_t(S) + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} S^2 {\partial}_S^2 V_t(S) - \left\{ \int (e^z-1) {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) \right\} S {\partial}_S V_t(S) 
                        \\ + \int \left\{ V_t(e^z S) - V_t(S) \right\} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)."
"\end{gathered}$$ Here $\nu$ is the cumulative jump frequency distribution, i.e., for an interval $I$ with characteristic function $\chi_I$, $\nu(\chi_I)$ gives the frequency of jumps of size in $I$."
In particular $\nu({\mathbb{R}}) = \lambda$.
"Two remarks are in order here:

1."
"The diversification of jump risk is problematic not only in our model (as there is only one asset), but also in practice: In a typical market crash, jumps occur in the whole market, so diversification may well turn out to be accumulation of risk."
2.
"Merton’s proposal coincides with a naive interpretation of the Black–Scholes framework which states that for risk-neutral pricing one simply has to adjust the drift term such that the expected drift vanishes (in discounted units), and that the appropriate hedging strategy is given by the derivative of the price."
"In particular, the real-world drift does not enter the price, which is a benefit, as it is notoriously hard to estimate."
"Note that the assumption that diversification is possible is crucial here, since otherwise one could not invoke no-arbitrage arguments to set the expected return of the portfolio to zero."
"If one drops this assumption, then the investor should (i) try to find an optimal balance between diffusion and jump risk and (ii) value the remaining risk in order to obtain a risk premium."
"A popular framework that achieves (i) is minimal variance pricing and hedging, cf."
[@Schweizer94; @GourierouxEtAl98] and references therein.
"There, the investor tries to minimize the variance of the expected returns."
It has the advantage that no new concepts have to be introduced.
"However, the choice of a quadratic criterion is somewhat arbitrary and penalizes profits as well as losses."
"Furthermore, in the case of a jump diffusion, the framework in general yields a *signed* risk-neutral measure, i.e., there would be positive claims which have a negative value in the framework."
"Finally, the framework only tackles (i), but does not yield a price for the remaining risk."
A framework that achieves (i) and (ii) at one stroke is utility based pricing and hedging.
"There, the investor is equipped with a concave von Neumann utility function $U(X_T)$ that assigns an economic value to the wealth $X_T$ at the investment horizon $T$."
Risk aversion is encoded in the concavity of $U$ which entails that the investor prefers a secure income to a random income with the same expectation.
This preference is encoded in the risk aversion $A(x) = - U''(x)/U'(x)$.
"In this framework, the appropriate price $v$ for a claim with payoff $C(S_T)$ is the indifference price, i.e., the amount the investor should receive such that her maximal expected utility $E[U(X_T - C(S_T))]$ for initial capital $x + v$ is the same as the expected utility $E[U(X_T)]$ for initial capital $x$."
This means that one has to consider investment and hedging at the same time and then try to disentangle them.
"In general, this is a very complicated optimization problem."
"However, in the limit where the number of traded claims is infinitesimally small, the problem becomes much simpler."
One then speaks of the *marginal indifference price* and the corresponding *marginal optimal hedge*.
This field has ripen considerably during the last years.
"Milestones were the papers of Kramkov and S[î]{}rbu, who gave sufficient criteria for the the marginal indifference price to be well-behaved [@KS06], and defined the concept of the marginal optimal hedge, together with convenient characterizations of it [@KS07]."
"The framework was applied to, e.g., basis risk [@KS07], transaction costs [@Wilmott; @Monoyios], and Lévy processes and stochastic volatility models [@KMV09]."
"In spite of its conceptual elegance, the practical applicability of the framework seems to be limited by two problems:

1."
"The marginal indifference price and the marginal optimal hedge depend strongly on the real-world drift, which is notoriously hard to estimate."
2.
The marginal indifference price (and also the marginal optimal hedge) are essentially independent of the risk aversion of the investor [@Nutz10].
The second fact is quite inconvenient for a framework whose purpose is to incorporate risk aversion.
"It turns out that the two problems can be solved, at one stroke, by a change of perspective."
The marginal indifference price takes into account how well the option trade matches to the optimal investment strategy of the investor.
The assumption is of course that the investor is invested in this optimal strategy.
"However, the investment strategy a bank chooses is typically not derived from the model that is used to price options."
It is thus tempting to interpret the *actual* investment strategy as the optimal one and adjust the drift such that they match.
One may thus speak of an *implied drift*.
"To the best of our knowledge, this concept is new."
"In the following section, we introduce utility based pricing and hedging in a heuristic fashion."
"In particular, we do not (explicitly) use semi-martingale decompositions, on which the rigorous mathematical treatment [@KS06; @KS07] heavily relies."
"Instead, we use the concept of functional differentiation and derive a formula for the marginal optimal hedge that is similar to the well-known $\Delta$ hedging formula."
"It has a straightforward economic interpretation and is, to the best of our knowledge, new."
"We suspect that, when made mathematically precise, this approach is equivalent to setting of Kramkov and S[î]{}rbu in the common domain of applicability."
"At least for the case of a jump diffusion under power utility, this is shown to be true, as we re-derive results implicitly contained [@KMV09]."
"For the case of exponential utility we obtain results that are, to the best of our knowledge, new."
"Even though the approach presented here is not (yet) mathematically rigorous, and, if made so, presumably equivalent to that of Kramkov and S[î]{}rbu, it might still be interesting, as it sheds new light on the framework and is also straightforwardly applicable in a discrete time setting, which might be useful in practical applications."
"In Section \[sec:Interpretation\], we discuss our results, in particular the two problems mentioned above."
The concept of implied drift that solves these is also introduced.
"As a nontrivial toy model that exemplifies the discussion, we use a jump diffusion with fixed jump size."
We also compare the marginal utility price and hedge with those obtained in Merton’s and the minimal variance approach.
We conclude with a summary and an outlook.
"A heuristic derivation {#sec:Derivation}
======================

The basic idea of marginal utility based pricing and hedging is the following: Consider an investor with a concave utility function $U$, i.e., the expected utility for investment with time horizon $T$ is given by $$u_t(x; \pi) = E[U(X^\pi_t)| X^\pi_t = x],$$ where $X^\pi_t$ is the wealth process depending on some trading strategy $\pi$."
"This is maximized by the optimal investment strategy $\pi^*$: $$ u_t(x) = \sup_{\pi} u_t(x; \pi) = u_t(x; \pi^*).$$ Throughout this paper, we will consider trading strategies given by a space of functions $(t, x, s) \mapsto \pi_t(x,s)$ of time, wealth, and the asset price, that is equipped with some locally convex topology."
"Furthermore, we assume that the set of admissible trading strategies is an open subset, and that it contains a unique optimal investment strategy $\pi^*$."
This allows us to consider infinitesimal perturbations of $\pi^*$.
"Furthermore, $\pi^*$ should be such that the maximal expected utility is finite and such that the asset process is a local martingale under the measure ${\mathcal{Q}}$ defined by $$\label{eq:Q}
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{\mathcal{Q}}}{{\mathrm{d}}P} = \frac{U'_T(X_T^{\pi^*})}{E[U'_T(X_T^{\pi^*})]},$$ where $P$ is the real-world measure."
"For conditions under which the last requirements are fulfilled, we refer to [@Sch01]."
"If we now want to value a European claim with maturity $T$ and bounded payoff $C(S_T)$, where $S_t$ is the asset process, we force the investor to short an infinitesimal number $\varepsilon$ of them."
"For this she may charge a price $v^\varepsilon_t(x,s)$ per claim."
"It is the indifference price if $$\label{eq:DefIndifference}
 u_t(x) = \sup_\pi E[U(X^\pi_T - \varepsilon C(S_T)) | X^\pi_t = x + \varepsilon v^\varepsilon_t(x,s), S_t = s].$$ It means that the investor is willing to sell the options at a price $v^\varepsilon$, as this does not decrease her expected utility."
The limit $$v = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} v^\varepsilon$$ is the *marginal indifference price*.
The marginal optimal hedge can be similarly characterized as the linear change of $\pi^*$ that is needed to achieve the maximum on the [r.h.s.
]{}of .
"Before we formalize this notion, we discuss the wealth process $X_t^\pi$ and the optimal investment strategy $\pi^*$ for the case of a jump diffusion and introduce functional differentiation, a technical tool we later employ."
"The wealth process and optimal investment {#sec:OptimalInvestment}
-----------------------------------------

The wealth process $X^\pi_t$ corresponding to the asset process , given a trading strategy $\pi_t$, is given by $$\begin{aligned}
    {\mathrm{d}}X^\pi_t & = \pi_t(X^\pi_{t_-}, S_{t_-}) {\mathrm{d}}\log S_t \\
    & = \pi_t(X^\pi_{t_-}, S_{t_-}) \mu {\mathrm{d}}t + \pi_t(X^\pi_{t_-}, S_{t_-}) \sigma {\mathrm{d}}W_t + \pi_t(X^\pi_{t_-}, S_{t_-}) (e^{J_t} - 1) {\mathrm{d}}N_t\end{aligned}$$ Here $\pi_t(x, s)$ denotes the wealth invested in the asset at time $t$, given that the total wealth is $x$ and the asset price is $s$."
"Note that no interest rate is present, so we are working in discounted units."
"For a quantity $F_t(x, s)$, depending on time $t$, the wealth $x$ and the asset price $s$ that fulfills $$\label{eq:piConsistency}
    F_t(x, s; \pi) = E[F_\tau (X^\pi_\tau, S_\tau; \pi) | X^\pi_t = x, S_t = s] \quad \forall t \leq \tau,$$ one obtains the partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) $$\label{eq:Fevolution}
{\partial}_t F_t(x, s; \pi) + L^\pi F_t(x, s; \pi) = 0,$$ where $L^\pi$ is the integro-differential operator defined by $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:Lpi}
    L^\pi f_t(x, s) & = \mu \left\{ \pi_t(x, s) {\partial}_x + s {\partial}_s \right\} f_t(x, s)  \\
    & \quad + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} \left\{ {\pi_t(x, s)}^2 {\partial}_x^2  + 2 \pi_t(x, s) s {\partial}_x {\partial}_s + s^2 {\partial}_s^2 \right\} f_t(x, s) \nonumber\\
    & \quad + \int \left\{ f_t(x + \pi_t(x, s)(e^z-1), e^z s) - f_t(x, s) \right\} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)."
\nonumber\end{aligned}$$ Note that in we included the dependence on the trading strategy $\pi$.
"As $\pi$ is a function (of $t$, $x$ and $s$), $F$ is, apart from being a function of $t$, $x$ and $s$, also a *functional*, i.e., a map from a space of functions to the real numbers."
"A useful tool for discussing extrema of such functionals are functional derivatives, which we briefly discuss in Section \[sec:FunctionalDerivatives\]."
"In the absence of consumption, the expected utility $u_t(x; \pi)$ fulfills (\[eq:piConsistency\])."
"For the maximal expected utility $u_t(x)$, the HJB equation $$\sup_\pi \left[ {\partial}_t u_t(x) + L^\pi u_t(x) \right] = 0$$ holds, where the supremum is achieved by the optimal investment strategy $\pi^*$."
"Thus, the optimal investment strategy $\pi_t^*$ fulfills $${\partial}_{\pi_t(x)} |_{\pi^*} L^\pi u_t(x) = 0.$$ Using the explicit form (\[eq:Lpi\]) of $L^\pi$, we obtain $$\label{eq:PiStar}
    \mu u'_t(x) + \pi^*_t(x) \sigma^2 u''_t(x) + \int u'_t(x^z) (e^z-1) {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) = 0,$$ where we used the notation $$\label{eq:Xz}
 x^z = x + \pi^*_t(x)(e^z-1)$$ for the wealth after a jump."
"Having solved for $\pi^*$, we know that $u_t$ fulfills the PIDE $$\label{eq:uPIDE}
    {\partial}_t u_t(x) + L^{\pi^*} u_t(x) = 0.$$ For investment with a time horizon $T$, the boundary condition is given by the utility $U$ at time $T$, i.e., $u_T(x) = U(x)$."
"We now discuss the form of $\pi^*$ and $u_t$ in the two cases that will be of most interest to us, namely the case of constant relative or absolute risk aversion."
"Constant relative risk aversion is specified by a utility function $$\label{eq:Upower}
 U(x) = x^{1-\beta} / (1-\beta), \quad \beta > 1.$$ The limit $\beta \to 1$ corresponds to logarithmic utility, and the results below are also valid in that case."
"It can be shown that, up to an unimportant multiplicative constant, the expected utility $u_t$ is of the same form, i.e., $$    u_t(x) = B_t x^{1-\beta} / (1-\beta).$$ Introducing the notation $\tilde \pi_t^*(x) = \pi_t^*(x) / x$, becomes $$\label{eq:TildePi}
    \mu -  \tilde \pi^*_t(x) \beta \sigma^2 + \int (e^z-1) (1 + \tilde \pi^*_t(x) (e^z-1))^{-\beta}  {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) = 0.$$ We see that $\tilde \pi^*_t(x)$ is independent of $x$ and $t$."
The optimal strategy is to invest a fixed fraction of the wealth in the asset.
"For precise conditions under which a solution to exists, we refer to [@Nutz10b]."
"We now discuss a special case which we will study explicitly in Section \[sec:Interpretation\] and in which can be solved analytically:

If only jumps of a certain size $J$ can happen, i.e., $\nu(z) = \lambda \delta(z-J)$, then becomes $$\label{eq:TildePiPower}
    \mu -  \tilde \pi^* \beta \sigma^2 + \lambda \tilde J (1 + \tilde \pi^* \tilde J)^{-\beta} = 0.$$ Here we introduce the notation $\tilde J = e^J-1$ for the relative jump size."
"For logarithmic utility, i.e., for $\beta = 1$ this has an analytic solution: $$\label{eq:TildePiLog}
    \tilde \pi^* = - \frac{1}{2 \tilde J} \left\{ 1 - \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2} \tilde J - \sqrt{\left( 1  - \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2} \tilde J \right)^2 + 4 \frac{\mu + \lambda \tilde J}{\sigma^2} \tilde J } \right\}.$$ This has the expected behavior: $\tilde \pi^*$ always has the same sign as the average drift $\mu + \lambda \tilde J$."
"Also note that the expression under the square root is strictly positive, so that an optimal investment strategy always exist for a fixed jump size."
"For $\beta > 1$, can easily be solved numerically."
"We briefly consider the case of constant absolute risk aversion, i.e., exponential utility $$\label{eq:Uexp}
 U(x)=-C e^{-\alpha x}, \quad \alpha > 0.$$ As above, the expected utility is of the same form, where $C$ (but not $\alpha$) is time dependent."
"The optimal investment strategy $\pi^*_t(x)$ fulfills $$\label{eq:PiExp}
    \mu - \pi^*_t(x) \sigma^2 \alpha + \int (e^z-1) e^{- \alpha \pi^*_t(x) (e^z-1)} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) = 0.$$ A solution $\pi^*_t(x)$ of this equation will be independent of $x$ and $t$, so that the optimal strategy is to invest a fixed amount of wealth in the asset."
"Furthermore, it is antiproportional to the risk aversion $\alpha$, i.e., we can write $$\label{eq:barPi}
 \pi^* = \bar \pi^* / \alpha$$ for some constant $\bar \pi^*$."
"Noting that, for large $\beta$, $\tilde \pi_*(\beta)$ behaves as $\beta^{-1}$, one obtains, by inspection of and that $$\label{eq:betaLimit}
 \lim_{\beta \to \infty} \beta \tilde \pi^*(\beta) = \bar \pi^*.$$

Finally, we remark that by applying the PIDE to the terminal condition $W(x)=U'(x)$, one can show that for $\pi^*$ fulfilling , one has $w_t = u'_t$, i.e., $$\label{eq:del_XU}
 u'_t(x, s) = E[U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s].$$

Functional derivatives {#sec:FunctionalDerivatives}
----------------------

We briefly introduce the concept of functional derivatives as a special case of directional derivatives, cf."
[@Hamilton; @lcs].
"Let $F$ be a functional, i.e., a continuous map $U \to {\mathbb{R}}$, where $U$ is an open subset of a space $X$ of functions[^1]."
"Then $F$ is called *differentiable* at $f \in U$ in the direction $h \in X$ if the limit $${\langle \delta F(f) , h \rangle} := \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{F(f+th) - F(f)}{t}$$ exists."
"It is called *continuously differentiable* (or $C^1$) on $U$ if the limit exists for all $f \in U$, $h \in X$ and if $\delta F: U \times X \to {\mathbb{R}}$ is continuous."
"If $F$ is $C^1$, then $\delta F(f): X \to {\mathbb{R}}$ is linear."
"Many of the usual theorems of differential calculus hold, in particular the fundamental theorem."
It follows that a necessary condition for a $C^1$ functional to have a local maximum in $f$ is the vanishing of $\delta F(f)$.
"The second derivative can be defined as the derivative of the first derivative, [w.r.t."
"]{}$f$, i.e., $${\langle \delta^2 F(f) , h \otimes k \rangle} := \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{{\langle \delta F(f+tk) , h \rangle} - {\langle \delta F(f) , h \rangle}}{t}.$$ We say that $F$ is $C^2$ on $U$ if the limit exists for all $f \in U$ and $h,k \in X$ and is a continuous map $\delta^2 F: U \times X \times X \to {\mathbb{R}}$."
In that case $\delta^2 F(f)$ is bilinear and symmetric.
This generalizes to derivatives of arbitrary order.
"There is a Taylor formula from which it follows that a sufficient condition for a $C^2$ function to have a local maximum in $f \in U$ is that $\delta F(f) = 0$ and ${\langle \delta^2 F(f) , h \otimes h \rangle} < 0$ for all $h \in X$."
"If $F$ is $C^1$, then $\delta F(f)$ is a continuous linear functional on $X$, so $\delta F(f)$ is a distribution."
"Similarly, if $F$ is $C^2$, then $\delta^2 F(f)$ is a symmetric bi-distribution."
"Employing the familiar abuse of notation to express a distribution in terms of an integral kernel, we sometimes write $${\langle \delta F(f) , h \rangle} = \int \delta_{f(x)} F(f) h(x) {\mathrm{d}}x,$$ and analogously for the higher order derivatives."
"The functionals that we want to differentiate below are solutions to a PIDE of the form , which we want to differentiate [w.r.t. ]{}$\pi$."
"More precisely, let $w$ be a solution to the PIDE $${\partial}_t w_t(x, s; \pi) + M^\pi w_t(x, s; \pi) = 0,$$ where $M^\pi_t$ is an integro-differential operator that depends on $\pi$."
"We will want to compute $$\delta_{\pi_t(x,s)} w_t(x, s; \pi),$$ i.e, compute the change in $w_t(x,s; \pi)$ if $\pi$ is perturbed at the same point, namely at time $t$, wealth $x$ and asset price $s$."
We assume that the PIDE is solved backwards in time from some terminal condition.
"Formally, we thus have $$w_t(x, s; \pi) = w_{t+{\mathrm{d}}t}(x, s; \pi) +  M^\pi w_t(x, s; \pi) {\mathrm{d}}t.$$ The effect of turning on a perturbation $\pi'$ of $\pi$ that is localized around $x, s$ and in the time interval $[t, {\mathrm{d}}t)$, can thus be computed by differentiating $M^\pi$ [w.r.t. ]{}$\pi$."
"One thus obtains $${\langle \delta_\pi w_t(x, s; \pi) , \pi' \rangle} = {\partial}_\pi M^\pi w_t(x, s; \pi) \pi'(x, s) {\mathrm{d}}t.$$ Here ${\partial}_\pi$ only acts on the operator $M^\pi$."
"The limit where $\pi'$ tends to a Dirac $\delta$ in time corresponds to ${\mathrm{d}}t \to 0$, $\pi' \sim {\mathrm{d}}t^{-1}$."
"Hence, we obtain $$\label{eq:FunctionalDiff}
 \delta_{\pi_t(x, s)} w_t(x, s; \pi) = {\partial}_{\pi_t(x,s)} M^\pi w_t(x, s; \pi).$$

In the following, we assume that the expected utility is $C^2$ in a neighborhood $U$ of $\pi^*$."
This is the case if $$\int u''_t(x+\pi_t(e^z-1)) (e^z-1)^2 {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) < \infty$$ for $\pi \in U$.
"For $\pi = 0$, this means that the jump distribution must have a finite second moment."
"The marginal indifference price
-------------------------------

We want to determine the marginal indifference price $v$ from ."
"As the perturbation is infinitesimally small, we can assume that the trading strategy $\pi^\varepsilon$ that achieves the maximum on the [r.h.s."
]{}of fulfills $\pi^\varepsilon = \pi^* + \varepsilon \bar \pi + {\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^2)$.
We also have $v^\varepsilon = v + {\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon)$.
"Thus, expanding in $\varepsilon$, we obtain $$\begin{gathered}
 u_t(x) = u_t(x) + \varepsilon v_t(x,s) {\partial}_x u_t(x,s) - \varepsilon E[ U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) C(S_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s] \\
 + \varepsilon {\langle \delta_\pi u_t(x; \pi^*) , \bar \pi \rangle} + {\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^2),\end{gathered}$$ To obtain the fourth term on the r.h.s., we used functional differentiation [w.r.t. ]{}$\pi$."
"This term vanishes, since $\pi^*$ is optimal."
"Equating the remaining terms of first order in $\epsilon$, one obtains [@Davis] $$\label{eq:MarginalPrice}
 v_t(x, s) = \frac{E[ U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) C(S_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s]}{u'_t(x) }.$$ It follows that in order to determine the marginal indifference price $v$ it suffices to know $\pi^*$, i.e., one does not have to solve the full optimization problem."
"Using the tower property, can be expressed as an expected value for quantities at times $\tau$ with $t < \tau \leq T$: $$\label{eq:MarginalPriceTau}
    v_t(x, s) = \frac{E[ u'_\tau(X^{\pi^*}_\tau) v_\tau(X^{\pi^*}_\tau, S_\tau) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s]}{u'_t(x) }.$$ In this form, the pricing problem can be solved backwards in time with the payoff as the terminal condition."
"In continuous time, the limit $\tau = t + {\mathrm{d}}t$ will yield a partial (integro-) differential equation."
"In the case of jump diffusion, one obtains from the PIDE $$\label{eq:PricingPIDE}
    {\partial}_t v_t(x, s) + L^{\mathcal{Q}}v_t(x, s) = 0,$$ where $L^{\mathcal{Q}}_t$ is the integro-differential operator defined by $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:LQ}
    L^{\mathcal{Q}}f_t(x, s) & = \mu^{\mathcal{Q}}\left\{ \pi^*_t(x, s) {\partial}_x + s {\partial}_s \right\} f_t(x, s)  \\
    & \quad + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} \left\{ {\pi^*_t(x, s)}^2 {\partial}_x^2  + 2 \pi^*_t(x, s) s {\partial}_x {\partial}_s + s^2 {\partial}_s^2 \right\} f_t(x, s) \nonumber\\
    & \quad + \int \left\{ f_t(x^z, e^z s) - f_t(x, s) \right\} {\mathrm{d}}\nu^{\mathcal{Q}}(x; z)."
\nonumber\end{aligned}$$ where we used the notation and changed the drift and the jump distribution [w.r.t.
"]{}$L^\pi$, cf."
", as $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:nuQ}
 {\mathrm{d}}\nu^{\mathcal{Q}}(x; z) & = \frac{u'_t(x^z)}{u'_t(x)} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z), \\
\label{eq:muQ}
 \mu^{\mathcal{Q}}(x) & = - \int (e^z-1) {\mathrm{d}}\nu^{\mathcal{Q}}(x; z).\end{aligned}$$ Here the adjusted drift and jump distribution define the risk-neutral measure ${\mathcal{Q}}$, cf."
.
Let us briefly discuss the intuition behind .
"Recall that $U$, and thus also $u$, is concave, i.e., $u'(y) < u'(x)$ for $y > x$."
"Suppose the asset has, on average, positive returns."
"Then the optimal investment strategy will be to invest in the asset, i.e., $\pi^* > 0$."
"Then, for a downward jump, $z<0$, we have $x^z < x$."
It follows that the fraction on the [r.h.s.
"]{}of is greater than one, so that downward jumps become more (and upward jumps less) frequent."
The opposite happens for $\pi^* < 0$.
"The economic rationale behind this is the following: If the investor is invested in the asset, she is exposed to the risk of downward jumps."
She will thus seek remuneration for taking even more downward jump risk.
"On the other hand, she is also exposed to the risk of no upward jumps happening."
She is thus willing to sell a claim that is exposed to upward jump risk with a discount.
Finally serves to set the average drift to zero.
"If the process is a pure diffusion, i.e., $\lambda = 0$, the terms in the first and the third line in vanish."
All other terms that have some $x$-dependence involve ${\partial}_x$.
"Thus, if the terminal condition is independent of $x$, as for a payoff, the marginal indifference price is also independent of $x$ and one recovers the Black–Scholes PDE, in discounted units."
"From our discussion in Section \[sec:OptimalInvestment\], we know that in the case of constant relative or absolute risk aversion $u'_t(x^z) / u'_t(x)$ is independent of $x$."
"Thus, for these types of utility, the only terms in $L^{\mathcal{Q}}$ that depend on $x$ are those that involve at least one ${\partial}_x$."
"It follows that if the terminal condition is independent of $x$, the solution to will also be independent of $x$."
"Since by definition the payoff only depends on $s$, the marginal indifference price is independent of $x$ for constant relative or absolute risk aversion [@KS06]."
"We thus obtain

In the case of power utility, , the marginal indifference price is a solution to the PIDE $$\begin{gathered}
\label{eq:PricingPIDEPower}
    0 = {\partial}_t v_t(s) + \left\{ \int \{ e^z - 1\} \left(1+\tilde \pi^*(e^z-1) \right)^{-\beta} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) \right\} s {\partial}_s v_t(s) + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} s^2 {\partial}_s^2 v_t(s) \\
    + \int \left\{ v_t(e^z s) - v_t(s) \right\} \left(1+\tilde \pi^*(e^z-1) \right)^{-\beta} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z),\end{gathered}$$ where $\tilde \pi^*$ is a solution to ."
"In the case of exponential utility, , the marginal indifference price is a solution to the PIDE $$\begin{gathered}

A special case of was found in [@Lewis].
"There, it is assumed that all market participants have power utility, and so the market-clearing utility must also be of this form."
"Furthermore, the market is invested fully in the asset, the positions in cash and options cancel each other[^2]."
"This corresponds to $\tilde \pi^*(x) = 1$ in the present setting, which, inserted in , gives the PIDE of [@Lewis]."
"The marginal optimal hedge
--------------------------

We now want to study the marginal optimal hedge corresponding to the marginal indifference price."
"In the previous section, we expressed the trading strategy that maximizes the [r.h.s."
]{}of as $\pi^\varepsilon = \pi^* + \varepsilon \bar \pi + {\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^2)$.
We define the marginal optimal hedge $\hat \pi$ as $$\hat \pi = \bar \pi + v {\partial}_x \pi^*.$$ The idea behind this definition is the following: We want to determine the change in the optimal trading strategy that is caused by the option trade.
"Thus, we wish the investor to invest optimally as she would do without the trade plus some correction which we wish determine."
The purpose of the second term on the [r.h.s.
]{}of the above equation is to cancel the shift in the optimal investment strategy that is caused by the payment of the option price $v$.
As $\pi^\varepsilon$ is the optimizer on the [r.h.s.
"]{}of , the functional derivative at this point should vanish: $$ \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')} E[U(X^{\pi^\varepsilon}_T - \varepsilon C(S_T)) | X^{\pi^\varepsilon}_t = x + \varepsilon v^\varepsilon_t(x,s), S_t = s] = 0 \quad \forall (t', x', s').$$ Expanding this in $\varepsilon$, one obtains $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:expansion}
 0 & = - \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')} E[U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) C(S_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s] \\
   & \quad + v_t(x,s) \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')} {\partial}_x u_t(x; \pi^*) \nonumber \\ 
   & \quad + \int \bar \pi_{t''}(x'', s'') \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')} \delta_{\pi_{t''}(x'',s'')} u_t(x; \pi^*) {\mathrm{d}}t'' {\mathrm{d}}x'' {\mathrm{d}}s''."
"\nonumber\end{aligned}$$ The two derivatives in the second line commute, so by the optimality of $\pi^*$, this term vanishes."
We now want to argue that the second order functional derivative in the third term vanishes unless $t' = t''$.
Here the optimality (and the implicitly assumed Markov property of $S$) is crucial.
Assume that $t'' > t'$.
Then we may find $\tau$ such that $t' < \tau < t''$.
"We have, by the tower property $$u_t(x; \pi) = E[U(X^{\pi}_T) | X^{\pi}_t = x] =  E[ E[U(\tilde X^{\pi}_T) | \tilde X^{\pi}_\tau = X^\pi_\tau] | X^{\pi}_t = x].$$ Here we introduced the notation $\tilde X$ for the process from $\tau$ to $T$ in order to distinguish in from the process $X$ on which it is conditioned at $\tau$."
"Changing $\pi$ at $t'$ only affects the process $X$, while changing $\pi$ at $t''$ only affects $\tilde X$."
"In particular, the derivative [w.r.t."
"]{}$\pi_{t''}(x'', s'')$ can be pulled inside the outer expected value and the derivative [w.r.t."
"]{}$\pi_{t'}(x', s')$ does not act on the inner expected value."
But the derivative [w.r.t.
"]{}$\pi_{t''}(x'', s'')$ of the inner expected value, evaluated at $\pi^*$, vanishes, by optimality."
"Thus, the second order functional derivative in the third term on the [r.h.s."
]{}of vanishes unless $t' = t''$.
"For well behaved processes (in particular there should be no predetermined jump times), the second order functional derivative at equal times $t' = t''$ vanishes unless $(x', s') = (x'', s'')$."
"The intuitive reason is that a change of the trading strategy at $(t', x', s')$ can only affect paths that are at $(x', s')$ at time $t'$."
"But a path can not be at $(x',s')$ and $(x'', s'')$ at the same time unless $(x', s') = (x'', s'')$."
"We may thus write $$\begin{gathered}
 \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')} \delta_{\pi_{t''}(x'',s'')} u_t(x; \pi^*) \\ = \delta_D(t' - t'') \delta_D(x' - x'') \delta_D(s' - s'') \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')}^2 u_t(x; \pi^*).\end{gathered}$$ Here $\delta_D$ denotes the Dirac $\delta$ distribution and the second order functional derivative on the [r.h.s."
]{}is implicitly defined by this equation.
"Applying this to , we obtain $$\begin{gathered}
 \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')} E[U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) C(S_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s] \\
 = \left( \hat \pi_{t'}(x', s') - v_{t'}(x', s') {\partial}_x \pi^*_{t'}(x') \right) \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')}^2 u_t(x; \pi^*).\end{gathered}$$ For a constant payoff $P$, $v = P$ and $\hat \pi$ vanishes, so that we have $${\partial}_x \pi^*_{t'}(x') \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')}^2 u_t(x; \pi^*) = - \delta_{\pi_{t'}(x',s')} E[U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s].$$ This is valid for all $(t', x', s')$."
"In particular, we may choose $(t', x', s') = (t, x, s)$, and with and we obtain $$\label{eq:Proposition_2}
 \hat \pi_t(x, s) = \frac{u'_t(x, s) \delta_{\pi_{t}(x,s)} \frac{E[U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) C(S_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s]}{E[U'(X^{\pi^*}_T) | X^{\pi^*}_t = x, S_t = s]} }{\delta_{\pi_{t}(x,s)}^2 u_t(x; \pi^*)}.$$ Note that the expression that is functionally differentiated in the numerator is the marginal indifference price."
"Thus, this equation has a straightforward economic interpretation: The functional derivative in the numerator gives the marginal gain in the price $v$ one can generate by shifting $\pi$ from the optimal trading strategy $\pi^*$."
The factor in front of the functional derivative converts this into a marginal gain in utility.
"This gain in utility stemming from $v$ is to be balanced by the loss in utility that is incurred to the wealth process (without the claim) by deviating from $\pi^*$, which one finds in the denominator[^3]."
We also note the similarity of this formula with the sensitivities that are used in $\Delta$-hedging.
"However, in the present case, one does not differentiate the option value [w.r.t."
]{}the asset price but [w.r.t.
]{}the trading strategy and weights the result with derivatives of expected utility.
"This representation of the marginal optimal hedge might be useful in numerical calculations, where it could be used to compute $\hat \pi$, and simultaneously $v$, backwards in time in a discrete-time setting."
We may now evaluate for the case of a jump diffusion.
We note that the two quantities that are functionally differentiated are solutions to PIDEs that depend on $\pi$.
"We may thus proceed as discussed in Section \[sec:FunctionalDerivatives\], i.e., we apply ."
"As the derivation of from did not make use of the optimality of $\pi^*$, the functional derivative in the numerator may be computed by differentiating $L^{\mathcal{Q}}$ [w.r.t. ]{}$\pi$."
"Similarly, for the computation of the functional derivative in the denominator, we twice differentiate $L^\pi$ [w.r.t. ]{}$\pi$."
"Restricting again to the case of constant relative or absolute risk aversion, one obtains[^4]

In the case of power utility, , the marginal optimal hedging strategy is given by $$\label{eq:OptimalMarginalHedgePower}
    \hat \pi_t(s) = s \frac{ \sigma^2 {\partial}_s v_t(s) + \int \frac{ v_t(e^z s) - v_t(s)}{(e^z-1)s} \left( e^z - 1 \right)^2 \left( 1 + \tilde \pi^*(e^z-1) \right)^{-\beta-1} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)}{\sigma^2 + \int \left( e^z - 1 \right)^2 \left( 1 + \tilde \pi^*(e^z-1) \right)^{-\beta-1} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)},$$ where $\tilde \pi^*$ is a solution to ."
"In the case of exponential utility, , the marginal optimal hedge is $$\label{eq:OptimalMarginalHedgeExp}

"As the expected utility is $C^2$ by assumption, cf."
"Section \[sec:FunctionalDerivatives\], the integral in the denominator in and is finite."
"It follows that also the integrals in the numerator are finite, by the boundedness of $v$."
"In the pure diffusion case $\lambda = 0$ one recovers Black–Scholes $\Delta$ hedging, $\hat \pi = s {\partial}_s v$."
"But if a jump component is present, the marginal optimal hedge is not given by $s {\partial}_s v$."
"Instead, it optimally balances diffusion and jump risk, given the specified utility function."
"\[rem:RiskPremium\] Taking the marginal optimal hedge , as starting point and following the derivation of from , one does in general not recover the PIDE , for the marginal indifference price."
"This is not surprising, since in the present framework the investor wants to be compensated for taking risk."
"Minimal variance pricing and hedging
------------------------------------

The basic idea of minimal variance pricing and hedging was briefly discussed in the introduction."
"Here, we content ourselves with giving the corresponding price and hedge for our jump diffusion process."
"For the minimal variance price, one finds the following PIDE [@ColwellElliott93]: $$\begin{gathered}
\label{eq:PricingPIDE_MV}
    {\partial}_t v_t(s) - \left\{ \int \left\{ e^z - 1 \right\} \left\{ 1-\alpha(e^z-1) \right\} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) \right\} s {\partial}_s v_t(s) + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} s^2 {\partial}_s^2 v_t(s) \\ + \int \left\{ v_t(e^z s) - v_t(s) \right\} \left\{ 1-\alpha(e^z-1) \right\} {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z) = 0.\end{gathered}$$ Here $\alpha$ is a generalization of the market price of risk and is given by $$\alpha = \frac{\mu + \int (e^z -1) {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)}{\sigma^2 + \int (e^z -1)^2 {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)}.$$ Note that the new jump measure in gives negative frequencies for jumps with $\alpha (e^z-1) > 1$."
"For $\alpha > 0$, this condition will always be fulfilled for unbounded upward jump distributions, which includes Merton’s log-normal jump distribution [@Merton]."
"For the corresponding hedge one obtains $$\label{eq:mvHedge}
    \theta_t(s) = \frac{\sigma^2 {\partial}_s v_t(s) + \int \frac{v_t(e^z s)-v_t(s)}{(e^z-1)s} (e^z-1)^2 {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)}{\sigma^2 + \int (e^z-1)^2 {\mathrm{d}}\nu(z)}.$$

\[rem:RiskCompensation\] Taking $\theta$ as hedging strategy and following the derivation of Merton’s formula from , one recovers the pricing PIDE ."
"This shows that with minimal variance hedging one tries to minimize risk (as measured by the variance), but one is not compensated for it."
"This is in contrast to the setting of utility maximization, cf."
Remark \[rem:RiskPremium\].
"Possible modifications of the framework to include also a risk premium are discussed, e.g., in [@WilmottAhn]."
"The approach of Kramkov and S[î]{}rbu
-------------------------------------

We want to briefly compare the (as yet heuristic) framework of functional differentiation presented here with the rigorous approach of Kramkov and S[î]{}rbu [@KS06; @KS07]."
"There, one restricts to utility functions with bounded relative risk aversion, of which power utility is a special case."
Optimal hedging strategies are defined by their wealth process.
"The optimal wealth process for an initial capital $x$ and a quantity $q$ of claims is denoted by $X(x,q)$."
"The utility-based wealth process $G(x,q)$ is defined as $$G(x,q) = X(c(x,q), 0) - X(x,q),$$ where $c$ is the indifference price."
The marginal optimal hedge $H$ is defined as the derivative of $G$ [w.r.t.
]{}$q$ at $q=0$.
"Hence, the definition of the marginal optimal hedge presented here is based on the same idea as the definition of Kramkov and S[î]{}rbu."
Let us see whether the two notions coincide in the case of power utility.
By [@KS07 Thm.
"1], the process $H$ is given by (for initial capital $x=1$) $$H_t = X^{\pi^*}_t \left( V_0 + M \right),$$ where $V_0$ is the marginal indifference price and the process $M$ is the minimizer of the optimization problem $$c = \inf_{M} E_R \left[ \frac{U''(X_T^{\pi^*})}{X_T^{\pi^*} U'(X_T^{\pi^*})}  \left( X_T^{\pi^*} (V_0 + M_T) - C(S_T) \right)^2 \right].$$ Here $R$ is the measure given by $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}R}{{\mathrm{d}}P} = X_T^{\pi^*} \frac{U'(X_T^{\pi^*})}{u'}.$$ Following [@KMV09], one may write this as a minimal variance hedging problem under the measure $\tilde R$ defined by $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}\tilde R}{{\mathrm{d}}R} = \frac{U''(X_T^{\pi^*})}{X_T^{\pi^*} U'(X_T^{\pi^*})} E_R\left[ \frac{U''(X_T^{\pi^*})}{X_T^{\pi^*} U'(X_T^{\pi^*})} \right]^{-1},$$ provided that the [r.h.s."
]{}is a uniformly integrable martingale.
"As shown in [@KMV09], this is the case for power utility if the jump distribution has a finite second moment, a condition that we had to impose, too, cf."
the discussion at the end of Section \[sec:FunctionalDerivatives\].
Then one can use the minimal variance hedging formula with this measure.
One indeed obtains .
"Discussion {#sec:Interpretation}
==========

We will now discuss the results obtained so far."
"In order to exemplify the findings, we use the toy model of a jump diffusion with a fixed jump size $J$."
This model is analytically tractable [@Merton].
"Re-introducing the risk-free rate $r$, we have to solve a PIDE of the form $$    {\partial}_t v_t(s) + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2} s^2 {\partial}_s^2 v_t(s) + \{ r - \bar \lambda \tilde J \} s {\partial}_s v_t(s) - r v_t(s) 
    + \bar \lambda \left\{ v_t(e^J s) - v_t(s) \right\} = 0,$$ where we used $\tilde J = e^J -1$."
The only difference between the different methods and utilities lies in the value of $\bar \lambda$ that is employed.
The above is solved by $$    v_t(s) = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{( \bar \lambda (T-t))^k e^{- \bar \lambda (T-t)}}{k!}
"v_t(e^{k J} s, r, \bar \lambda \tilde J)$$ where $v_t(s, r, q)$ is the Black–Scholes price for the claim, given a risk-free rate $r$ and a dividend yield $q$."
"The price
---------

In order to get a feeling for the magnitude of the effect, we compare the marginal indifference price for logarithmic utility with Merton’s and the minimal variance price."
"We use a process with $\lambda = 0.25$, $\tilde J = - 0.25$, i.e., on average there is a jump of $-25 \%$ every four years."
"For the marginal indifference price, the relevant value for $\bar \lambda$ is obtained from and ."
The price for a put (converted to implied volatilities) is shown in Figure \[fig:Price\_PosRet\].
"As a reference, the square root of the annualized variance is indicated."
"We see that the marginal indifference price and the minimal variance price are quite close together, but the difference to Merton’s price is notable."
"For a moneyness of 0.5, it corresponds to a price difference of 40%."
"That the marginal indifference price and the minimal variance price are above Merton’s price is not a generic feature, but depends on the average drift of the asset."
"This is illustrated in Figure \[fig:Price\_NegRet\], which shows the same plot as before, but with an expected drift $\tilde \mu = - 0.05$."
Now the marginal indifference price and the minimal variance price are below Merton’s price.
"This can be understood as follows: If the expected drift is positive, the investor will be invested in the asset."
"Since jumps are always downwards in our model, she is exposed to jump risk."
Writing a put on the asset in this situation enlarges this exposure.
She will thus ask for a risk premium.
"On the other hand, if the expected drift is negative, the investor is short the asset and is then exposed to the risk of no jumps happening."
Writing a put in this situation diminishes the exposure to this risk.
"Thus, she can sell the put with a discount."
"This strong dependence on the drift seems to limit the practical applicability of the framework, as it is very hard to estimate."
Another disturbing feature of the marginal indifference price is that it is essentially independent of the risk aversion.
That it is completely independent of the risk aversion $\alpha$ in the case of exponential utility is obvious from .
"But also for power utility, it is independent of $\beta$ in the limit $\beta \to \infty$."
"Using and comparing and , one easily sees that the marginal indifference price for power utility converges to the one for exponential utility in the limit $\beta \to \infty$."
This property was proven in a general setting in [@Nutz10].
"In our example, this is shown in Figure \[fig:beta1\]: The price changes very little with the risk aversion and approaches the price for exponential utility in the limit $\beta \to \infty$."
"The implied drift
-----------------

The two features just discussed, the drift dependence and the essential risk aversion independence of the marginal indifference price seem to limit the practical applicability of the framework."
We also note that the essence of the indifference price is that it takes into account how well the option trade matches to the optimal investment strategy.
But typically the investment strategy a bank chooses is not derived from the model that is used to price options.
A possible way out is a change of perspective: One takes the actual investment strategy as given and tries to take it into account for the valuation and hedging of options.
"This is possible straightforwardly, as , , and do not contain the original drift directly, but only via $\tilde \pi^*$ or $\bar \pi^*$."
In the case of power utility one would thus set $\tilde \pi^*$ to the fraction of the wealth that is actually invested in the asset and use and .
"In the case of exponential utility, one uses the actual amount invested in the asset and the risk aversion $\alpha$ to compute $\bar \pi^*$ via ."
It is easily seen that this amounts to a change of the drift in the original problem.
One may thus speak of an implied drift.
"Note however, that this implied drift need not be computed for pricing and hedging."
It suffices to know the actual investment strategy.
"This change of perspective solves the problems discussed above: One does not need to know the drift, and the price and hedge will in general depend on the risk preference."
This is exemplified in Figure \[fig:beta2\].
We see that the marginal indifference price increases considerably with the risk aversion.
"We note however, that also the opposite effect is possible: For a negative actual, i.e., optimal, investment strategy, the marginal indifference price decreases with risk aversion."
"Again, this is due to the fact that by selling a put the investor can hedge the risk of no jumps happening, to which she is exposed by her investment strategy."
"Nevertheless, the marginal indifference price is always greater than the Black–Scholes price, in which the jump component is neglected."
"Finally, we note that for $\pi^* = 0$, one recovers Merton’s price."
"This, however, is not true for the marginal optimal hedge, which coincides with the minimal variance hedge for $\alpha = 0$ in that case."
"The hedge
---------

We now discuss the hedges corresponding to the prices considered before."
Figure \[fig:Delta\_PosRet\] shows the hedges for the prices shown in Figure \[fig:Price\_PosRet\].
"While the minimal variance and the marginal optimal hedge are relatively close together, the deviation from Merton’s hedge is noticeable."
"Heavily out of the money ($S=200$), the relative difference is over 150%."
Note that this strong deviation stems mainly from the new hedging formula and not so much from using a different price.
"This can be seen from Figure \[fig:Delta\_PosRet\_2\] where, for the same parameters as above, Merton’s hedge and the optimal marginal hedge are compared to the derivative [w.r.t."
]{}$s$ of the marginal indifference price.
"This derivative is quite close to Merton’s hedge, so for hedging purposes it seems to be more important to use the appropriate hedging formula than to use the correct price."
"Finally, we compare the marginal optimal hedges corresponding to the prices shown in Figure \[fig:beta2\]."
These are shown in Figure \[fig:beta3\].
"We see the expected behavior, i.e., for out of the money puts the higher the risk aversion the shorter the investors are in the asset in order to hedge against downward jumps."
"Summary & Outlook
=================

We discussed marginal utility based pricing and hedging for the case of a jump diffusion process."
We pointed out two problems that seem to limit the practical applicability of the framework: The drift dependence and the essential risk aversion independence of the marginal indifference price and the corresponding hedge.
"We proposed to circumvent these by a change of perspective, by interpreting the actual investment strategy as the optimal one."
We also compared the marginal utility based framework conceptually and concretely in a toy model with the minimal variance and Merton’s framework.
It would be desirable to apply the framework to more realistic models like a log-normal jump distribution or variance-gamma processes.
"While this is no problem in principle, we note that by the inclusion of a risk preference, the jump distribution is changed."
"Thus, computational methods that rely on a particular form of the jump distribution may no longer be applicable."
"This work is based on a dissertation for the part-time MSc in Mathematical Finance at Oxford University, which was written under the supervision of Jan Obloj."

NEW DELHI: India proposes to directly transfer fertiliser subsidy to accounts of millions of farmers as the Narendra Modi government looks to improve efficiency of delivery systems and ensure benefits reach those targetted.A plan to directly transfer subsidy of phosphorous and potassium fertilisers on a pilot basis in 20 districts from next year has been discussed at the highest political level.The proposal is included in a package for agricultural sector that is expected to include measures to strengthen farm-to-fork linkages and strengthen post harvest facilities.The measure could be announced in the budget as part of the plan for farmers and steps for subsidy rationalisation.
"The government budgeted spending of Rs 22,500 crore on these fertilisers in FY16."
"Total fertiliser subsidy, bulk of which goes to urea, is pegged at Rs 73,000 crore.The government is expected to make use of the Jan-Dhan Yojana platform, which was started for easy and universal access to financial services , and its proposed initiative to recognise arrangements between cultivators and owners to transfer these benefits."
"“Going forward, DBT will be mainstay of the subsidy plan.A plan for fertiliser is under discussion,” said a government official."
"The government has already announced DBT plans for kerosene and next in line are fertiliser and food.In April 2010, government had decontrolled phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, allowing manufacturers to fix their maximum retail price and get a fixed subsidy."
"This benefit could instead be directly provided to the farmer.The subsidy at present is Rs 12,350 a tonne for phosphates and Rs 9,300 a tonne for potash."
"However, there is a growing view within the government that direct transfer of benefits to farmers would allow for sustainable and measured use of chemical fertilisers."
"The government is also looking at freeing up urea imports and promoting organic fertilisers.It proposed using the rural job guarantee scheme to help create compost pits for promoting sustainable, need-based and affordable fertiliser consumption.Initiatives for farmer producer organisations and enabling them to connect directly with food parks and cold chains are expected to figure in the budget."
"Steps to boost postharvest facilities in the rural hinterland are also being considered to bring down the loss of produce, which can be as high as 20%."

Business

Deutsche Bank poised for major revamp

Will Deutsche just spin off Postbank or its entire retail operation?"
"Either way, there are mounting fears of job losses."
They could be part of a major overhaul Germany's largest bank is expected to announce soon.
"Analysts and banking experts have been busy speculating on the future of Germany's largest financial institution, Deutsche Bank."
"The bank wants to reinvent itself and, to that end, its management is expected to submit a new strategy to the bank's supervisory board."
"Speculation is focused on the future of Postbank, which has been part of the group since 2010."
"According to reports, Deutsche has narrowed its options down to two."
"One is to split the group into two separate legal entities, with one focusing on investment banking and the other dealing with retail businesses."
The second option is to spin off Postbank.
"Waiting for the big hit

""I believe investors are expecting the board to provide more clarity on the new strategy, and that means they would like to see more decisions come out of the board meeting than just the sale of Postbank,"" said Hans-Peter Burghof, a banking expert at the University of Hohenheim."
"Burghof told DW that the goal of the new strategy therefore has to be to surprise the capital markets and show that the bank's management can produce results."""
"The current uncertainty, however, means that employees at Postbank - numbering some 14,800 - are increasingly concerned about job security, particularly after recent wage negotiations came to a standstill, and employees began a strike on April 20."
"Strike at Postbank

Trade union Verdi is demanding a 5.5-percent payrise for the bank's employees."
"The dispute, however, is chiefly about better protection from dismissal for all of Postbank's staff."
"Due to the discussions over strategy at Deutsche, the issue of protection from dismissals gained prominence during the collective bargaining round."
"In a ballot, almost 95 percent of the members had voted for an indefinite strike to push through the issue of job security

However, many of the Postbank employees are already civil servants with permanent contracts who cannot be fired."
"But the bank has repeatedly said that it cannot exclude the possibility of redundancies, given the continuing pressure on margins and structural changes in the industry."
Experts say offering employees protection against dismissals would reduce the price that any interested buyer would be willing to muster.
Spain's Santander group and France's BNP Paribas are seen as potential buyers of Postbank.
An acquisition would give either buyer the opportunity to expand their presence in Germany.
Sell at a loss?
It is not clear yet how much the sale of Postbank could net Deutsche Bank.
"German business weekly ""Wirtschaftswoche"" estimates Deutsche Bank could pocket 6 billion euros by selling its subsidiary - exactly the same amount it paid for Postbank five years ago."
"But insiders put the figure at a more modest 4 billion euros on account of the bank's portfolio of risky assets, which amount to some 11 billion euros."
"""It will be difficult to sell Postbank without offering a large discount on its book value,"" writes German daily ""Süddeutsche Zeitung,"" citing an unnamed investment banker."
"Nevertheless, it remains to be seen what decision Deutsche Bank's management and its supervisory board will make with regard to Postbank, said analyst Burghof."
"""As a professor in banking, I believe a bank should be diversified and capable of offering a wide variety of services,"" he underlined."
"""A bank must also be able to deal with the tension between different corporate cultures,"" the expert stressed."
"Radical option

If the board decides to split Deutsche Bank, it would be a radical decision to slim down its operations, which could boost earnings."
"At present, as a universal bank, Deutsche offers investment and retail banking as well as wealth management."
Retail clients are offered services by both its Deutsche Bank and its Postbank brands.
Big changes are therefore expected in retail banking.
"But even if Postbank were to be hived off, there could still be more job cuts at Deutsche Bank's retail banking operations."
"The new strategy paper is believed to contain proposals envisaging the closure of up to a third of the 700 branches the bank operates in Germany, with potentially thousands of job losses."
"Investment banking won't be spared

Investment bankers, mainly based in the City of London, are bracing for job losses due to funding cuts

The restructuring is also expected to affect Deutsche's investment banking division, which could see bigger cuts than originally expected."
"The division's business volume could be cut by up to 200 billion euros, reports say."
"The division has to be downsized as many of its activities consume too much capital, according to news agency Reuters, which cited soucres in financial circles."
"Deutsche, however, remains mum on all the speculation surrounding the bank."
A spokesperson reiterated that the results of the ongoing strategy debate will be published before the end of June.
The bank's management will then also have to focus on how to get its people back on board.
"Employees' motivation

""This is the aspect I am most anxious about,"" says banking expert Burghof."
He wonders what Deutsche will do to motivate staff and get them to commit to the bank after a period of high uncertainty.
"""The culture change the bank wants to achieve means that Deutsche has to be seen as a long-term and reliable partner."
"And it is not going to achieve that with short-term strategy changes."""
"Sean Gallagher, the brother of Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, has written a blistering op-ed published by the Navy Times late Tuesday night that details the corrupt Navy prosecution of his brother and condemns the self-righteous reaction of the Pentagon brass to President Trump’s repeated interventions to stop the abuse of his brother."
"Gallagher notes the Navy also abused his brother’s young children, dragging them out of their home at gun point in their underwear in a morning raid while their mother was at work and their father detained at NCIS–and later making them dress in robes so as to not arouse sex offenders when they visited their father when he was put in a sex offender prison under false pretenses."
Gallagher expresses his outrage at those who wailed about “good order and discipline” in the military supposedly being undermined by President Trump yet those same officers and Pentagon civilian appointees were silent as the military justice system corruptly prosecuted his brother and others–even rewarding the corrupt prosecutors with medals.
"Excerpts:

In this partisan environment, people were quick to judge President Donald J. Trump’s reinstatement of anchors to my brother, Special Warfare Operator Chief Edward “Eddie” Gallagher."
"TRENDING: BREAKING: Multiple Injuries After Car Plows Through Crowd of Trump Supporters in Yorba Linda, California (VIDEO) Out of the woodwork came former military attorneys, indignant Pentagon officials and your typical Washington establishment types."
Their views were mainly the same.
The president’s actions were a moral hazard!
What message will it send our troops?
What of good order and discipline?
I have one question for these people: Where in the hell were you the past year and a half?
"Eddie’s case and court-martial trial revealed a massive cancer within the military justice system, doing irreparable damage to troop morale that may last decades."
I didn’t hear a damn thing from these harbingers of moral decency when that was exposed.
Where was their outrage when the Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents dragged my brother’s kids in the street at gunpoint in their underwear?
"(A fact NCIS denied to this very publication until under oath admitted that, yes, they did drag my nephews nearly naked into the streets of San Diego when Ed wasn’t home)."
"Where were these critics when investigators admitted Eddie’s entire pretrial imprisonment was based on a lie, forcing him to spend eight months in a sex offender brig for nothing?"
"Thanksgiving is nearing, so please imagine having to spend it like Ed did last year, greeting your kids in jail where they had to wear robes so they didn’t arouse other inmates."
Where were these guardians of moral decency when prosecutors spied on our attorneys?
When they hid exculpatory evidence?
Illegally leaked slanted information to the media to taint a jury pool?
Lied to members of Congress and then tried to cover it all up when they got caught?
"They were nowhere, because their outrage is hollow and they don’t have clue what they’re talking about… (Conclusion) …Our family’s message to you is this."
"That flag on your uniform, and the Constitution you swear to protect, also protects you."
"No one, not even members of your own military, can deny you your rights, especially the right to due process and a jury of your peers."
It is the only thing that saved my brother form a lifetime of unjust imprisonment.
It also guarantees civilian control of the military.
"So while the brass rails about moral hazards and pontificates about good order, the Gallagher family will continue to cast our ballots for those who actually support our warfighters and not some other agenda."
"President Trump was right to intervene on Eddie’s case, and that should terrify every person wearing a uniform."
End excerpt.
Sean Gallagher has written a detailed account of his brother’s case with supporting links embedded in his Navy Times op-ed.
It is well worth the read.
Please click here to read the entire Navy Times op-ed.
Eddie Gallagher is set to retire November 30 with his SEAL Trident pin thanks to President Trump who stood up to the Pentagon brass and reminded them who is commander in chief when they tried one more time to unjustly punish Gallagher after Trump restored his rank and pay grade following a minor conviction of posing for a photo with the corpse of an ISIS fighter in Iraq in 2017 (Gallagher was the only one punished even though several others were in the photo) and his acquittal on all other charges including murder.
Navy Secretary Richard Spencer was fired last weekend for his insubordinate and dishonest maneuvering in reaction to Trump ordering a halt to a spiteful last minute inquiry against Gallagher to kick him out of the SEALs.
Gallagher has filed an IG complaint with the Defense Department over the abuses in the handling of his case.

"The Call-In: Your Stories About Veterans Affairs

This week's Call-In is about the Department of Veterans Affairs: stories from veterans about getting health care and ideas for reforming the whole agency."
"LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:

And this is the Call-In."
Today we're talking about veterans' health care.
"In recent years, the VA has developed a reputation for red tape, long wait times and lapses in care."
"So we asked you to share your stories about getting the care you need from the VA.

MATT SIMMONS: Hey there, NPR."
"My name is Matt Simmons (ph), retired Army Sergeant."
CLAYTON MCARTHUR: This is Clayton McArthur (ph).
"I'm from Tuscaloosa, Ala.

CHRISTINA VERDAROSA: My name is Christina Verdarosa (ph)."
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I'm an Army veteran.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Marine Corps veteran with PTSD.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I'm a Vietnam veteran with three different service-connected disabilities.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We have some of the best doctors in the world.
We just don't have enough of them.
"UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: My care was so bad that they couldn't even perform the necessary surgeries to save my life, and they had to outsource it."
"UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Tell me, you don't have a wait times when you set up something in the civilian world."
"UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: My experience with VA health care has been pretty good, actually."
Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Bye.
"GARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR's Quil Lawrence reports on Veterans Affairs, and he joins us now."
"Hey, Quil."
"QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu."
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to start with a pretty simple question.
"How many people get their care through the VA, and what determines how people qualify?"
LAWRENCE: Sure.
"There are about 20 million vets in the United States, most of them from earlier eras - World War II, Vietnam - when there was a draft."
About 9 million of them are enrolled in VA health care.
About 6 million of those are sort of regular yearly users of VA health care.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's a huge system.
LAWRENCE: Yeah it is.
It's the largest single-payer system in the country.
Most vets can qualify for it if they have a service-connected injury.
"If they are five years after having served in the recent wars, they can make it."
There's also an income threshold.
"So the VA more or less says if you're a vet, you should apply, and we'll let you know if you're eligible, but most - many vets are."
"GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, I want to have you listen to some of the calls that we got."
"We got a ton of messages like this one from Joyce Davenport (ph) of Ocklawaha, Fla. Let's listen."
"JOYCE DAVENPORT: I have been a patient of the VA since my discharge back in the 70s, and I have had only wonderful experiences with them."
They have gotten me through some very rough times.
"I've received 100 percent of my medical care from them, and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate them being there."
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I should say the vast majority of the people who called in were really happy with their VA care.
Are vets mostly satisfied?
LAWRENCE: Yeah.
And I can hear the surprise in your voice.
"And that's, I suppose, partly due to the fact that negative headlines are what really run the media."
"So...

GARCIA-NAVARRO: No."
"LAWRENCE: (Laughter) Yes, it's true."
I'm not surprised by that at all.
"Even people who are having problems say the bureaucracy of getting their care or getting a disability rating, getting things - sort of getting in the door - they will say, well, but my doc at the VA is wonderful."
"So VA, in studies, rates as good or better than in the private sector in most areas of health care."
"Although, the question really is, compared to what?"
What care would this veteran be getting in the private sector if the VA wasn't there?
"GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK, we're going to come to that in a minute."
"But first, you mentioned something, which is that the VA has gotten a lot of negative press - long wait times, shortages of doctors, and we got calls about that, too."
Listen.
"MARK COYUS: My name is Mark Coyus (ph), and I am a Marine Corps veteran calling from Denver, Colo."
"I think that the VA is overworked, understaffed and underpaid."
"With the state of the world and how much our veterans sacrifice for us with so little in return, the status quo is unacceptable for both them and VA caregivers."
"GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK, so what have been the biggest problems?"
LAWRENCE: The VA is a massive bureaucracy.
"It's got 360,000 employees."
"They literally invented the term red tape at VA, and there were horrible backlogs when a lot of recent vets were coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan."
"In 2014, a scandal kind of came to a head about senior managers who had been lying about their statistics - about how fast they were seeing veterans."
And there were some somewhat misleading headlines about veterans who were dying while they were waiting for care.
"And that brought about calls for reform, which were quite genuine but also somewhat politically motivated, where VA health care, which is the largest example of government-run health care in the country, became kind of a proxy battle for people in Congress who love the idea of government health care against people who hate the idea of government-run health care."
"GARCIA-NAVARRO: There's been a lot of effort made to improve veterans' care, and this is a bipartisan issue."
Congress passed legislation a few years ago to make it easier for veterans to access that private care.
Can you bring us up to speed on this?
What does it mean for the VA system?
"LAWRENCE: So again, in response to this scandal in 2014, Congress passed a law called the Veterans' Choice Act."
"They wanted to get something set up quick but, as a result, it's been a real mixed bag."
"It was a system so that veterans, if they had been waiting too long or if they lived too far from a VA, they could just go out to a private doctor get their care, and the VA would pay for it."
The result in many cases was just another maddening layer of red tape.
Sometimes it took longer to get an appointment in the private sector than it would have originally at the VA.
But the VA's always done some referrals for private care.
"This month, President Trump signed an order extending the Veterans' Choice program just as kind of a stopgap because it was about to expire in August."
But we're expecting Congress and the VA to work on a way to streamline this process.
And they say they're going to pass that sometime in the fall.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to play you this message we got from Anna Smith (ph) who's worried about the VA's future.
"ANNA SMITH: I fear that some changes that people are proposing, such as privatizing parts of it and that sort of thing, is just going to ruin a good deal for those of us who are lucky enough to be able to use the services of the VA.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you've talked about this political football of people pro and against sort of socialized medicine, if you will."
What kind of support is there for privatization?
LAWRENCE: So no one will say they want privatization.
All of the veterans organizations say that they're against it.
"The new secretary of the VA, Dr. David Shulkin, says he's against privatization."
"Now, that doesn't stop some people from claiming that there is sort of a Trojan horse here, where this Veterans' Choice program of allowing vets to go into the private sector is an attempt to bleed resources away from the VA into private care, which is much more expensive, and that would sap the VA's resources and make the care even worse and lead to this sort of spiral."
The VA is supposed to be this sort of holy vow to take care of veterans.
Abraham Lincoln said that it was created for those who have borne the battle and their widow and their orphan.
"On the other side are people who say, well, the VA can be a lot leaner with strategic use of the private sector in remote places - in places where there's too much demand on their clinics."
"This is a battle that we're going to see continue to play itself out with a lot of people who sincerely studied VA health care and then a lot of people who have a political agenda, as well."

"Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, results in severe disease in neonates and the immunocompromised, including AIDS patients."
"Currently there are few effective chemotherapeutic options, and those that are available are frequently associated with adverse side effects."
Ribonucleotide reductase is an enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and therefore is essential for DNA synthesis.
Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) has proven to be a promising target for chemotherapy of herpes virus infections.
The primary goal of this project is to characterize ribonucleotide reductase of Toxoplasma gondii and evaluate the enzyme as a potential target for chemotherapy of toxoplasmosis.
As part of this effort we plan to clone the RNR genes and express biologically active enzyme.
This recombinant enzyme will be fully biochemically characterized.
"In vitro RNR assays, in conjunction with parasite tissue culture will be used to screen candidate inhibitors."
Effective agents and currently available anti-Toxoplasma agents will be tested for synergistic action against parasites.
Any agents which appear to have promise as specific anti- Toxoplasma agents will also be tested in in vivo models of toxoplasmosis.
"In addition, peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of the small subunit of RNR will be tested for their ability to inhibit RNR."
Mutant parasites resistant to candidate drugs will be generated and analyzed in order to more fully understand the basis of drug-enzyme interaction.
Our hope is that these studies will form the basis for design of new novel agents for treatment of toxoplasmosis.

Congress, wireless industry team up to make stolen phones worthless - mrsebastian

Oh, they're going to make it illegal to tamper with the IMEI."
"That's all
solved then."
Why don't they just make it illegal to steal peoples phones instead?
"~~~
rimantas
Stealing is legal in US?"
That's some news.
"~~~
mseebach
Yes, it is, isn't it?"
"Without sarcasm: Why would it help to make tampering with the IMEI illegal,
when the illegality of stealing in the first place doesn't solve the problem?"
"~~~
mrsebastian
Well, I guess if you (unwittingly?)"
"buy a stolen phone, the feds would want
IMEI tampering to be illegal?"
"I assume there's lots of bulk IMEI tampering done by fences, too."
"~~~
mseebach
If it's unwittingly, why would I bother with changing the IMEI?"
"If it's wittingly, I'm already a criminal."
"And you're right, IMEI changing probably already is a default part of fencing
a phone."
"The solution would be to make it a requirement that phones have tamper proof
IMEIs."
"------

This changes very little for the moment:

1\."
"Most of the phones in the US are CDMA carrier exclusives; they maintain
their own stolen/lost databases."
"Even 10 years ago you could call Verizon or
Sprint and they would blacklist the ESN/MEID."
2\.
"If you've probably noticed the majority of the US is currently on CDMA
which isn't anywhere else outside of US/CA/SKorea."
"Taking that stolen Verizon
flip phone to Mexico gets you a brick."
"In the future with a larger LTE footprint this can be effective but I'll have
to see."
"------
pimentel
Regarding the selling of the cellphone to a friend, you probably should change
legal ownership of the device, just like you should when selling/buying a car
from a friend."
"I'd feel safer with this mobile device blacklist, and I believe there are no
issues of privacy, since we're not talking about permanent tracking of a
cellphone's location."
"------
pppp
Won't most of the stolen phones be sent out of the country where they will be
unaffected by this arrangement?"
"~~~
mrsebastian
If this is implemented in the US, and enough privacy safeguards are put in
place, I'm sure it'll spread to the EU and then the rest of the world."
"~~~
bennysaurus
This already exists in Australia and has for years."
"It's as simple as getting
a police report done and ringing your phone company to get the IMEI blocked."

I found a Nexus phone, and a Droid Razor phone the past few months."

Congress should not be concerning itself for making certain programming
functions legal and other ones illegal."
"The illegal action should be
identified and made illegal, not the events leading up to the illegal action."
"Backspace out that line of computer code citizen, don't make me taze you."
"Legislating what i can and can't do with the wires in my own device because I
_might_ be stealing the phone?"
"Sounds to me like a chess move to increase congressional power over the
citizens through tapping into the computer in every pocket."

I don't see the link between your first two lines and the third."
"How are they
""tapping into"" your phone?"
"You do realise that your phone has a _phone

The Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed controversial legislation that would allow the families of September 11th victims to sue Saudi Arabia — one of America’s regional allies — if they are found to be responsible for helping support the terror attacks.
"“When you lose someone to such evil...the temptation is to curse the darkness,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, one of a group of bipartisan lawmakers pushing the legislation said during a press conference on Tuesday."
“These families have lit a candle…not only to bring justice to themselves but to send a loud message to foreign governments.
"If you help create terrorism on American soil, you will be brought to justice.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, had been blocking this legislation but recently released his hold."
"The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent after Schumer and bill co-sponsor, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, spoke on the floor."
"Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) take questions during a news conference concerning the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), on Capitol Hill, May 17, 2016, in Washington, DC."
"On Tuesday, the Senate passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) bill."
The bill would allow survivors and relatives of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks to file lawsuits seeking damages against the government of Saudi Arabia.
"Drew Angerer / Getty Images

The White House strongly opposes the legislation and reiterated Tuesday that the administration feels that the bill would leave America vulnerable to similar suits."
The Senate-passed legislation would clear the way for Americans to sue foreign nations if they are found to be responsible for terror attacks on U.S. soil — an attempt to support the 9/11 families' efforts.

“We have to consider the significant unintended consequences of moving forward with legislation like this,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during a press briefing on Tuesday."
"“It could put the U.S. at risk around the world… it is a dangerous proposition.”

Relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have been strained of late — partly the result of regional unrest and frustration over the legislative efforts aimed at holding that country accountable in the September 11th attacks."
Saudi Arabia said they previously warned they could sell off $750 billion in American assets if that nation is held liable for the attacks.
"""We said that a law like this is going to cause investor confidence to shrink."
"And so not just for Saudi Arabia, but for everybody,” Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said earlier this month in a statement."
"The Saudi Foreign Minister said that Saudi Arabia’s position on the proposed legislation was based on basic principles of relations between states, particularly the principle of sovereign immunity."
"""In fact what they [Congress] are doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle,"" he said."
"""That's why the [Obama] administration is opposed to it, and that's why every country in the world is opposed to it.”

The Saudis did not respond specifically to the Senate vote on Tuesday but maintain they were not complicit in the 9/11 attacks."
"Cornyn called the Saudi's position on being forced to sell off American assets a ""hollow threat""."
"Related: On Saudi Arabia Trip Obama Seeks to Quell Tensions

The brouhaha centers on the belief, held by a number of 9/11 families and a bipartisan cadre of lawmakers that Saudi Arabia was involved in the attacks on that fateful day: 15 of the 19 terrorists were Saudi."
"There is also a renewed push to declassify 28 pages of a 838-page congressional report from 2002 that some critics, such as former Senator Bob Graham, say will highlight funds and connections that helped terrorists pull off the 9/11 attacks."
"Flowers are laid at the 9-11 Memorial site on September 11, 2015 in New York City."
"Nearly 3,000 people were killed in attacks in New York, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania."
"Andrew Burton / Getty Images, file

The 9/11 Commission, in a separate report, previously said it ""found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded"" the attacks."
But some critics say the phrasing in the report was crafted in a way as to leave open the possibility of a connection.
"As of now, there are no plans in the House to take up this bill."
Speaker Paul Ryan has said in the past this issue needs to be looked at and a House Judiciary committee aide told NBC News that the committee intends on holding a hearing on the Senate version of the bill in the near future.
"“I think we need to look at it,” Ryan told reporters at a recent press conference."
“I think we need to review it to make sure that we’re not making mistakes with our allies and that we’re not catching people up in this that shouldn’t be caught up in this.”

The influence of fabrication errors on the stopband magnitude responses of SAW devices.
This article is devoted to the analysis of the influence of manufacturing errors on the magnitude responses of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices.
Analytical analysis of these random errors provides statistical distributions of the relevant responses and their parameters.
"It allows significant reduction in the modeling computations compared to the Monte Carlo method, and it provides possibilities for further analytical analysis."
"After the application of the statistical analysis to different potential structures of SAW devices, it is possible to choose the least sensitive one during the design process without the need of costly trials."
Experimental analysis confirmed the existence of some of the features predicted both theoretically and by modeling.
The experimental procedure for the evaluation of the fabrication error variances is described.
"The application of these results to the design process of the SAW devices allows simplification of the requirements for the manufacturing equipment and/or improvement of the devices' parameters, especially stopband suppression."
Encoding the future: successful processing of intentions engages predictive brain networks.
"Evidence from cognitive, patient and neuroimaging research indicates that ""remembering to remember"" intentions, i.e., prospective memory (PM) retrieval, requires both general memory systems involving the medial temporal lobes and an executive system involving rostral PFC (BA 10)."
"However, it is not known how prospective memories are initially formed."
"Using fMRI, we investigated whether brain activity during encoding of future intentions and present actions differentially predicted later memory for those same intentions (PM) and actions (retrospective memory)."
We identified two significant patterns of neural activity: a network linked to overall memory and another linked specifically to PM.
"While overall memory success was predicted by temporal lobe activations that included the hippocampus, PM success was also uniquely predicted by activations in additional regions, including left rostrolateral PFC and the right parahippocampal gyrus."
This finding extends the role of these structures to the formation of individual intentions.
"It also provides the first evidence that PM encoding, like PM retrieval, is supported by both a common episodic memory network and an executive network specifically recruited by future-oriented processing."

"Pretty cool, right?"
"In Kilpisjärvi,
Finland, there’s a new glamping experience called the Aurora Wilderness Camp."
"Three individual glass-windowed and glass-roofed cabins are
towed on skis into a remote wilderness location, deep in the Arctic Circle."
"While you can choose to go outdoors to watch the Aurora, you have the option of
being lazy (and warm) while watching from the comfort of your room."
"Lie on your
bed, and look up!"
"Each cabin measures 2.5m wide, 4.5m long and 2m tall, and
includes a comfortable, wide bed; a table; dry toilet; a gas heater with
thermostat; and gas stove."
"But, the Aurora Wilderness Camp does want you to go
outdoors, too, and they offer snowshoes and kicksleds so you can go out and
explore."
Dress warmly!
Here’s how it works.
"After your guide brings you to the
campsite by snowmobile, you’ll learn how to make a campfire and grill some
local sausages."
"Then it’s just you and Northern Lights, with snacks and hot
drinks to keep you fueled and warm."
Breakfast is included.

"The present invention relates to footwear, and more particularly, to footwear having a heel and a footbed."
"Typically such footwear includes an outsole, an insole, and an upper."
"When constructing this type of footwear, the upper is drawn over a last and attached to an insole using adhesive, tacks, and/or stitching."
An outsole is attached to the joined upper and insole using adhesive and/or stitching.
A rigid shank is attached to the outsole to provide the footwear with stiffness between a heel portion of the outsole and a forward portion of the outsole that contacts the ground during use.
"A heel is attached to the outsole, usually with fasteners."
Various other components such as a liner may also be attached to the shoe.
"Although this conventional construction provides rigid support for a wearer's foot, the construction does not absorb impact and the footwear may become uncomfortable after extended wear."
Athletic shoes are typically constructed using other techniques.
"In one technique, an upper is stretched over a last and attached to a foundation so the upper retains its shape."
A sole is attached to the upper and foundation using conventional techniques such as vulcanization.
"In some athletic shoes, an engineered insole is inserted into the shoe so it rests on top of the foundation."
Conventional athletic shoe insoles may be constructed of one or more types of foam providing soft areas for shock absorption and firm arms for support.
"For example, in some shoes, portions of the insoles intended to lie under an arch of a wearer are made from materials having greater resistance to compression so they support the arch."
Other portions of the insoles such as those intended to lie under a heel of the wearer may be made with greater shock absorption.
Still other portions of the insoles such as those intended to lie under metatarsal heads of the wearer may be provided with greater flexibility or cooling features.
"Although these insoles work well in athletic shoes, providing these features to heeled footwear such as high heel women's shoes, boots, and sandals has proven difficult without increasing complexity, weight, and/or cost of constructing the footwear."

"#1,219 – C# 6.0 – Filtering Exceptions

November 5, 2014

C# 6.0 will include support for exception filters, that is–only catching a particular type of exception if an associated expression evaluates to true."
You can filter exceptions by including a when statement after the catch expression.
"If the result of evaluating the expression supplied is true, the exception is caught."
"If not, the behavior is as if you didn’t supply a catch block."
"In the example below, we don’t catch divide by zero exceptions on Saturdays."

Is JSON for computers or humans to read?
"Well, hopefully with this snippet it can be for both."
"Instead of just dumping all the json in one line, we instead format it and indent it for readability purposes."
"Using the MarshalIndent function in the json package we’re able to not only specify the data to encode, but also a prefix and an indentation string."
"In our example we’re not to worried about the prefix, but the indentation (3rd parameter) allows us to structure our code."
"There are many guides on how to setup a docker container running Go, but the aim of this post is to provide a basic starting point - as often they become complicated and split across many files."
"It’s also aimed at getting it running locally for development purposes quickly, so it might not be production ready."
"To begin with we create a basic http server, which just says status: ok on the root endpoint."
"In Go, we can store and use dates using the time package and although a date in Go cannot be saved as null (because there’s no such thing) there is an unset state."
"This unset state can be shown as 0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC and there’s a simple way we can check if a date variable has been populated, as demonstrated below."
"It’s also important to note that these are not unix timestamps, which go back as far as 1970, but can handle a large spectrum of dates."
This is an example of checking if a pair of long/lat coordinates lie within a polygon or multipolygon when working with geojson.
It’s often useful when working with geo-special data and maps to determine if the point your looking is within an area - or which area it’s within.
"We use the paulmach/orb package (see on github), which is deep and precise library for dealing with all sorts of spacial and geometric data."
"If you’ve ever come across messages like these, you’ll no doubt have used type assertion already."
This is a post explain how and why to use it.
cannot convert result (type interface {}) to type float64: need type assertion invalid operation: myInt += 5 (mismatched types interface {} and int) Functions and packages will at times return interface{} as a type because the type would be unpredicable or unknown to them.
"Using a web server as an example, there are multiple stages you can load resources."
Within the main() function and within the handler are the obvious two - each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
"Within the main function can hinder the start-up time of the server, while code within the handler is run on every request."
Sometimes we want to load a resource only once and when it’s first needed.
"It’s quite common to use the log package within your code to keep track of things which the end user might not need to see, like deprecated notices and warnings."
These are great when they are in production and you are monitoring the logs - but they will show up during your tests.
Below is an example test for our example application (even further below) which just asserts that the result of the function is 5.
"Programs often need to notify us of events and using services like Slack, Hipchat (or even email) make this convenient for us."
This code snippet is a way of sending a message to Slack via an Incoming Webhook - you can set these up in the Slack Apps area.
All you need is to set the incoming webhook url and change the text to be anything you want.
It does include a timeout (of 10 seconds) if something happens to Slack respose times for any reason.
"This post isn’t about the benefits or why you should be using https, instead it’s just about how to setup and use it with a basic Go web server."
Compared with a basic http server there are two main differences.
Firstly we need to generate some certificates and secondly we need to change our code to use the certificates and communicate over a TLS connection.
"Step 1: Commands to make self-signed certificates

One of the (many) positives of Go is it’s simple but powerful use of concurrency."
By using keywords like go we’re able to run functions in parallel.
"As easy as this is, we often need a way to run our next bit of code once all these goroutines have finished."
That’s where a WaitGroup comes in.
A WaitGroup allows you to specify how many goroutines have been created then wait for them to all be done.

"Today, I want to talk to you about the possibility of a misconfiguration in your network."
"Of course, right away you say, “That would never happen in my network.” Just in case it does, or better yet, when you need to blame someone else and you came along after the fact."
"I’ll show you a situation where I have, at least in the beginning, on purpose, misconfigured a subnet mask situation or IP address and mask situation."
"We’re going to run through collecting some information about it, and then we’re going to fix it and make sure it works."
"I have here a couple of clients, this is built in GNS3."
"My PCs are really routers, as you all know if you use GNS3, they’re really routers that are configured to act like IP endpoints."
"All I need is something to generate ping, so that works just fine."
"I’m going to try to ping the default gateway, it’s on router three there, the 10.1.1.254, and see if I can get there."
Let’s go ahead and bring up PC1.
Let’s see what happens if I try to ping 10.1.1.254.
"It’s trying, it’s trying, it’s trying, and we’re going to sit here with a little bit of patience and realize that it’s going to choke and die."
This could be a situation where you’ve been notified that the network’s down and there are problems.
You can see the connectivity is obviously failing.
One of your first steps is to fire up your packet sniffer.
"Inside GNS3, I can right click right on the red line and select “Start capture”."
"It gives me the option, because there’s two ends to this cable, of course, and connecting from the R3 side is fine so I’ll select “Ok”."
Then it will launch Wireshark and it starts capturing information.
Let me go back to that same ping and try again.
I’ll just hit the up arrow and try to ping 10.1.1.254.
"It’s still going to fail, but now I’m capturing information to find out why."
"Back to Wireshark and you’ll notice I’m getting ping, the request is going there."
"If I slide Wiresahrk out of the way we can see , 10.1.1.129 which is PC1."
"So the ping request is appearing in my data capture, but I’m not seeing anything happen on my client."
Let’s look at the scenario.
"You may be thinking, “What in the world can be the problem?” Your first thing, you look at the subnet mask in the scenario, and they’re all /28."
They’re the same.
"However the problem with that is, if you take that /28 and translate that into a decimal subnet mask 255.255.255.240."
If you’ve read my subnetting blogs then you realize that a 240 mask means you have a network increment of 16.
"If I look at the IP addresses of my PC1, my PC2, my router, I realize that the subnet ID for PC1 is the .128."
The .129 address is just the first address that’s available.
"If I look at the PC2, it has a 97 address, which means it’s on the 96 subnet."
"Lastly the router, 254, that means it’s on the 240 subnet."
Those are all multiples of 16.
"It turns out that even though they have matching subnet mask information, they’re on completely different networks."
"For instance, the 97 subnet, it’s actually the 96 subnet."
"97 is the first address, only extends up to what is 96 plus 16, 112."
"If I’m sitting on the .96, and I have an increment of 16, that means the next network behind me, 6 and 6 is 12."
"That means that 112 is the next subnet in this scheme, which means the highest address that could be on the same subnet that I’m in is the .111, which of course would be my broadcast address."
"The same reasoning holds true for PC2, it holds true for the router."
We see clearly that all of our IP endpoints here are on different networks.
Let’s correct it.
Let’s fix the router first.
"Notice I have the interfaces labeled, to make it easy."
"I want to go on F 0/0 on the router three, but I’m going to make this easy and make them all /24, 24 bit masks."
"Let’s go into interface, Fastethernet 0/0 on router 3."
"Let’s go ahead and go to interface, Fastethernet, 0/0

And IP address 10.1.1.254, but now a 24 bit mask."
"That’s corrected, I’ll go ahead and save the config."
Let’s do the same thing on PC1.
"It’s also interface, Fastethernet 0/0."
Config T interface Fastethernet 0/0.
"I want IP address 10.1.1, and let’s make sure we’re in the right one here."
This should be the 129.
"Again, the mask, 255.255.255.0, and save my config."
"Let’s do the same thing on PC2, config T, interface Fastethernet 0/0."
This guy is the 97 so IP address 10.1.1.97.
24 bit mask.
I still have the capture running in Wireshark so let’s verify it.
I’ll select auto scroll so that it keeps running.
"In the meantime, let’s go back to PC1 and try that ping again."
"Now, I didn’t correct the switch, but the switch really should be secured."
"I have it set up as a layer two switch, so it should just pass it on through, but let’s go ahead back to PC1."
Let’s clear screen so we’re up at the top again.
And let’s see if we can ping 10.1.1.254 now.
"Now that we have all actually in the same subnet, success."
We’re getting replies.
If I go back to Wireshark.
"Look at this, echoes and replies are getting to the target and getting back to the initiator of the ping."
Misconfigured subnet masks can mess you up.
"Again, at first glance, it didn’t even look like a misconfigured because they all matched /28s, but they’re all in different networks."
"A little bit of experience looking at a packet sniffer to see that there actually is information on the wire, and then the correction to make it work, ping again, save your configs and you’re a happy camper."
The surprise release of Google Chrome at the beginning of September triggered a great degree of interest in the web market.
"One month on, what is this new browser doing and how have competing browser market shares evolved?"
"Below, XiTi Monitor brings you the latest figures for the browser market in Europe."
"Perimeter:

Study conducted from April 1 to September 30, 2008

Cross-section of 145,506 websites audited by XiTi

Just a few weeks after its surprise launch, Google Chrome has not really been a knockout in Europe

Google Chrome, launched on Tuesday, September 2, 2008, has now been around for a little over a month."
"How is it doing in Europe now, compared with the main rival browsers?"
"The graph below presents the average market share achieved by the various browsers in Europe, for visits during the week of September 22 to 28, 2008."
"Google Chrome achieved an average visit rate of 1.07% in Europe, taking fifth place behind Safari (2.55%), Opera (4.24%), Mozilla Firefox (31.42%) and Internet Explorer (60.12%)."
Now let’s see how Google Chrome has developed since its release.
"The graph below shows Google Chrome's average share of European visits during the period from September 3 to 30, 2008."
"The conclusion is a fairly clear one: Google Chrome recorded its highest average share of European visits on the day after its release and has been losing ground ever since:

1.59% of European visits, on average, on Wednesday, September 3, 2008,

vs. 1.16% on Wednesday, September 10, 2008,

vs. 1.07% on Wednesday, September 17, 2008,

vs. 1.04% on Wednesday, September 24, 2008,

and lastly, 1.03% to close the month of September."
"After a novelty effect, the interest shown by web surfers for Google Chrome appears to have worn off, at least for now…

More than six out of every ten visits in Europe use Internet Explorer, whereas little more than three use Mozilla Firefox…

The table below compares the average share of European visits taken by the various browsers from April to September 2008 (from the 3 to 30, to be precise, so as to take into account the share achieved by Google Chrome on those days when it was present in the marketplace).During this six month period, Internet Explorer again lost a few points:

The average share of visits in a European country taken by the leading browser was 60.2% from September 3 to 30, 2008 versus 64.5% in April 2008, down by 4.3 points,

Nevertheless, Google Chrome's arrival did not speed up this drop, with the rate of visits using Internet Explorer actually reviving a little between August and September (+0.8 points)."
"While Mozilla Firefox achieved a 31% average share of visits in Europe from September 3 to 30, 2008:

Its numbers were up a little every month, with the free browser even hitting 33% in August 2008,

However, from September 3 to 30, 2008, the arrival of Google Chrome hit Mozilla in particular, which lost ground (because these users are more open to novelties than those using IE?"
"Nevertheless, trying it does not necessarily mean adopting it, so this trend will need to be watched during the coming months…), as will the leader's numbers too."
"Opera, the third most widely used browser in Europe (with a 4.8% share from September 3 to 30, 2008) progressed by 1.2 points during the last six months, whereas Safari held steady with an average share of European visits of 2.4%."
"… always on the forefront with the latest novelties

The graph below showing the average share of visits in Europe using Firefox 3 within its Mozilla family and IE7 within its Internet Explorer family lets us analyze the place taken up by the latest versions of the two main browsers within their overall share of visits."
"The observed behavior is completely different:

Three months after its launch (on June 19, 2008), Firefox 3 already accounted for seven out of every ten Mozilla Firefox visits,

Whereas nearly two years after hitting the market (on October 19, 2006), IE7 still only accounted for six out of every ten Internet Explorer visits."
"Although Google once again managed to get its name in the news in early September with the release of their Google Chrome browser, it has not made any massive inroads into the market so far."
"Internet Explorer and Mozilla are still way ahead, with a leader that, except in September, continued to lose ground to its challenger who was somewhat pushed around during the last full month.Mark this space during the coming months in XiTi Monitor to follow this Browser Indicator."
"Methodology:

The share of visits achieved by each browser corresponds to the total number of visits made using a given browser, compared with the total number of visits made using all browsers during the observed period."
"During the last part of the study, the share of visits made using Firefox 3 corresponds to the visits made using this browser compared with all visits made using Mozilla family products and the share of visits made using IE7 corresponds to the visits made using this browser compared with all visits made using Internet Explorer family products."
"In this study, the European indicator seeks to be representative of the countries that make up the panel."
The average share of visits in Europe corresponds to the average of the indicators for the 32 countries studied.
"As a result, the behavior by a European country that generates few visits is equitably taken into account in the numbers recorded for its continent."

One of the hardest parts of dealing with a new generation of consoles is that it’s hard to tell what’s CG and what’s in-game engine."
"No one knows how powerful a system is or what’s even possible, so when you’re first introduced to a new franchise, there’s that feeling out period as your eyes immolate themselves from the collective fireworks on the screen."
Is this actual in-game footage?
"Wait, it looks too good."
"Then again, this generation is supposed to be powerful."
"Oh crud, this might be it."
That’s what was going through my mind when I saw The Crew for the first time at E3 2013.
It was an impressive display of eye candy but the footage was CGI.
"When I saw actual game footage, I wasn’t sure what to make of it."
And I’m sure other players couldn’t get a handle on what The Crew exactly is.
"It was hard to put a finger on what made this game different from other next-gen racers, but then, in San Francisco, I had some hands-on time with the game recently in advance event for Gamescom and everything became clear."
The newest member of the “American Idol” judges panel describes herself as a “straight shooter” who calls ’em like she sees ’em and can adapt when she sees fit.
"“I’m someone who is real honest,” says Kara DioGuardi."
"“If I feel I need to be hard, I will be."
"Or if I need to be softer and more nurtring, I will be."
"It depends on the situation.”

In landing one of television’s plum gigs, DioGuardi, a Grammy-nominated songwriter who has worked with numerous “Idol” contestants, joins Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson on the Fox ratings juggernaut."
Her first duty comes tomorrow morning when she’ll serve as a judge at the New York City round of “Idol” auditions.
"“You have to see if there are fireworks tomorrow,” she told reporters on a conference call."
"“… Tomorrow’s like the first day at pre-school for me.”

DioGuardi’s surprise appointment comes on the heels of a seventh season in which ratings dipped for “Idol” and even some longtime devotees grew apathetic."
"In the time since, Fox has promised some changes and a few weeks ago executive producer Nigel Lythgoe departed the show."
Whether DioGuardi’s presence constitutes a needed change (What about those awful theme weeks?)
is open to debate.
But it is sure to stir conversation when the show returns in January.
And it is also sure to ignite speculation that “Idol” producers see her as a possible replacement for the often ditzy and clueless Abdul.
"On Monday Abdul said on Phoenix’s KISS-FM that she’s excited about DioGuardi coming aboard, according to UsMagazine.com, but added: “I am concerned about the audience and acceptance."
Time will tell.
"We’ll see.”

DioGuardi, who co-wrote a song with Abduul early in her career, forsees no jealousy issues arising."
"“I’ve always had a great relationship with Paula,” she said."
"“I can’t imagine her not being happy with (the hiring).”

Judging from her replies on the conference call, DioGuardi is certainly more articulate and coherent than Abdul, though that’s not saying much."
And she has very clear ideas on what makes a great “Idol” singer.
"“For me, what makes an artist is someone who when their song comes on radio I know exactly who it is,” she said."
“… It’s not about vocal acrobatics.
It’s about being unique and doing things that ere indentifiable to you.”

OSHA in the 1970’s developed new laws for the office environment.
The temperatures in offices should always be at 68-76 degrees and we need to keep the air quality free of any problems.
The humidity level should always be at 20-60 percent.
"In September, before school started the temperature in the school gym with no people in it was 84 degrees."

"Dream of Big Society conceals a nightmare, say Greens

Dream of Big Society conceals a nightmare, say Greens

Green Party leader Caroline Lucas has said that Prime Minister David Cameron's dream of a Big Society is “hiding a nightmare of socially devastating cuts”."
The Green Party of England and Wales has said that Prime Minister David Cameron's dream of a Big Society is “hiding a nightmare of socially devastating cuts”.
"Green Party leader Caroline Lucas attacked Cameron's comments in his speech to the Conservative Party conference this week, disputing his claim that the cuts are the only way to address the UK's economic problems."
She described the cuts agenda as an “ideological choice”.
"David Cameron told Tory delegates that, “I wish there was another way."
I wish there was an easier way.
"But I have to tell you there is no other responsible way.”

But Lucas insisted, “There is an easier and better way, a way that will avoid hurting a lot of innocent bystanders through savage cuts”."
"She explained, “If we increase taxes on the highest incomes, scrap expensive and irrelevant projects like Trident, transfer money from road-building to public transport and get tough on tax avoidance and evasion, we could afford a major public investment programme that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs while transforming the economy to help tackle climate change”."
"Lucas, who became the first Green MP in the UK when she was elected to represent Brighton Pavilion this year, accused the Prime Minister of being “in denial”."
"""He talked about how irresponsible it would be to leave our children to pay our debts,” she said, “But that’s exactly what inaction on climate change is doing."
"In fact, listening to Cameron, you wouldn’t think there was a climate crisis at all.”

The Tory leader has already come under fire from groups such as Friends of the Earth for failing to mention climate change in his speech."
"Lucas went on, ““He described the NHS as ‘protected’ but in fact it’s still under threat of privatisation."
"He said those on higher incomes must contribute more, but his changes to child benefit do so in a way that is patently unfair.”

The Green leader also attacked the Prime Minister's comments on education, saying that tuition fees are likely to soar under the coalition, meaning that education will “become more about the haves versus the have-nots”."
"Lucas added, “He said he will give people power, such as to choose what school their kids will go to."
"But the issue isn’t choice, it’s making sure every child has a place at a good local school.”

Will the world witness another economic recession

The world has moved into a precarious position, and over the
last two years, the growth witnessed in US have now again begun to recede."
"United States home sales and manufacturing units have witnessed a retarded
growth, which has led many economists to believe that things could go wrong in
the economic front."
"The European markets too, have shown no signs of
improvement in the year 2011, and now the fear is looming large among the
economists that another global recession is on the cards."
The fall in US credit ratings has not helped either.
"When two
of the world's major economic regions are stuttering to come to terms with their
own economy, the world will never have a sustained growth."
"The world’s 3rd
largest economy has its own problems, as Japan is finding tough to deal with the
recent Tsunami after affects in its region."
"The loss in Japan has fuelled economic
crisis and led to the belief that economic recession is on the cards."
"There is
very little chance that things will improve in the near future."
European market debts are eating up European banks.
"They now
face a situation, where they have no choice, but have to bear higher interest
for loans that they have taken to sustain the daily activities."
"American home
sales continue to drop, and if the trend continues, then the economic crisis
will translate into a global recession within two years from the time it was considered
to have left."
"The two years of growth after the recession has not done
enough."
The most worrying factor is Europe’s inability to deal with the debt crisis.
"In United States, jobs have been created, but are these jobs enough for the unemployed
people who are looking at the unemployment benefits for their daily livelihood."
"The numbers of jobless people who are dependent on unemployment benefits are
rising each week, and that is a sign of job crisis."
"Though, the risks for a
global recession are not very high, but it could turn worse, if the current trend
continues for some more time."
"Captan

This article is about the fungicide captan."
"Captan is also the common name for ethanethiol or ethyl mercaptan'', used as an odorant for natural gas and liquid propane delivery to help identify leaks."
Captan is a general use pesticide (GUP) that belongs to the phthalimide class of fungicides.
"It is a white solid, although commercial samples appear yellow or brownish."
"Applications
Although it can be applied on its own, Captan is often added as a component of other pesticide mixtures."
It is used to control diseases on a number of fruits and vegetables as well as ornamental plants.
"It also improves the outward appearance of many fruits, making them brighter and healthier-looking."
Captan is utilized by both home and agricultural growers and is often applied during apple production.
"It is also active against certain oomycetes, such as Pythium, making it useful for controlling damping off."
"Biodegradation
The compound biodegrades with halflife of less than 1 day in soil."
"Potential health effects
Captan was previously cited as Group B2, a probable human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but was reclassified in 2004."
"Since the mode of action has been established as a proliferative response (in mice only) after intestinal villi are disrupted, captan has been deemed not likely to cause tumors at doses that do not irritate the intestine."
"The EPA now states, ""The new cancer classification considers captan to be a potential carcinogen at prolonged high doses that cause cytotoxicity and regenerative cell hyperplasia."
"These high doses of captan are many orders of magnitude above those likely to be consumed in the diet, or encountered by individuals in occupational or residential settings."
"Therefore, captan is not likely to be a human carcinogen nor pose cancer risks of concern when used in accordance with approved product labels."
"A similar reclassification has been made for folpet, a structurally related fungicide, which shares a common mechanism of toxicity."
"A key finding for captan (and folpet) is these fungicides are not mutagenic in vivo; that is, they are not mutagenic in the intact animal."
"Production
It is the product of the reaction trichloromethylsulfenyl chloride with sodium salt of tetrahydrophthalamide."

"ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Derek Carr's surgically repaired right fibula, broken in a Week 16 Christmas Eve sack that derailed the Oakland Raiders' postseason plans, is healed enough that Carr is a full participant in the team's offseason training program."
This progress in the healing process comes just in time for the team's franchise quarterback to ramp up talks with Oakland for a contract extension.
The team gathered Monday for the start of the workouts.
"""I feel great,"" Carr said."
"""I've been running, jumping, throwing, cutting, everything."
So I'm ready to rock.
I'm ready to do absolutely everything.
I did everything my teammates did today.
I'll do everything my teammates will do tomorrow.
"""I'm truly blessed that it wasn't worse."
"It could have been a lot worse, and it wasn't, so I'm very thankful for that and just keep praying for the guys who, that day, had the same kind of injury and still going through it."""
Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota and Seattle Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett both suffered broken right fibulas on the same day.
Derek Carr finished tied with Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott for third in NFL MVP voting.
"Reinhold Matay/USA TODAY Sports

Carr, who helped lead the Raiders to a 12-3 start and the franchise's first playoff appearance since the 2002 season, passed for 3,937 yards while completing 63.68 percent of his passes with 28 touchdowns and six interceptions for a passer rating of 96.7."
He finished tied with Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott for third in NFL MVP voting.
"Reports late last season had Carr in line for an Andrew Luck-type payday after the Indianapolis Colts' QB signed a five-year, $123 million extension last summer."
Carr said his agent Tim Younger and Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie have been in constant communication.
"""For me, I understand now that it's a part of the game,"" Carr said."
"""Forever, I was like, 'Man, I just want to play ball."
I don't care about that.'
"But, now I'm understanding what has to get done, so maybe I should care about it."
I just ask questions to Tim and learning about the salary cap and these things and this and that.
It's just a lot of numbers that go over my head.
"""But the communication from both sides has been great."
"They let me know exactly where they're at, what they're trying to do."
"We let them know where we're at, what we're trying to do."
"So it hasn't been hard -- it's been easy."""
McKenzie said at the recent NFL owners meetings that he wanted to get Carr's extension done after the draft.
The Raiders have about $27.6 million in salary-cap space.
"""We're a family, so we're just trying to figure all of that out,"" Carr said."
"""They've been talking a little bit to build it, but I'll let them handle that, and hopefully it just gets done before training camp."
"Because once football, training camp starts, I won't even answer my phone if it has to do with that."""
Carr agreed that the numbers being talked out on a potential new contract are hard to fathom.
"""It makes me just super grateful,"" he said."
"""I know that that's going to help a lot of people."
"I get overwhelmed by it because I know how many people that will help -- not only with my family, my wife's family, around this country."
"""Even in Haiti, I have a heart for those people in Haiti who I love dearly, and that's the cool thing to me is that we'll be in a cool position to where we can help a lot of people."""
Carr was also asked about the potential of retired running back Marshawn Lynch joining the Raiders.
"""He's one heckuva football player, and I hope to play with him and those things, but again, I'm focused on the guys that are here today,"" said Carr, who said he spoke with Lynch on his visit to the Raiders' complex two weeks ago."
"""And I can't say, 'Oh, man, I hope he gets here,' and all those things."
"Of course, anyone would want Marshawn Lynch."
Any quarterback in the NFL ... add a good player to our team?
Absolutely.
"""With that said, I'm focused on who's here, and so I want to take this group and win the Super Bowl with this group that's here."
"And then as we add pieces, we'll hug them up and bring them in, just as a family, and treat them the same way that we do with all of our other teammates."""
"The season is still more than four months away, but Carr joked that he had his wife tackle him a few times and wrestled with All-Pro edge rusher Khalil Mack in the swimming pool to get him ready for the coming hits."
"""It felt like a long process, but it flew by,"" he said."
"""I've broken a lot of things."
I've torn a lot of muscles.
I've torn a lot of ligaments.
"Because this one happened at such a dramatic time, because it happened to where I couldn't play the next couple of games, it's kind of bigger than it was ... for me, the mental side is easy to defeat because it's me vs. me, and that's going to be a win every time."
"""I did absolutely everything I could to make sure I came back better, like Kobe [Bryant] said, Come back better than ever."
"I wanted to make sure that thing was going to be a nonfactor when I started doing things again."""
"# Private TLS Cert

This module can be used to generate a Certificate Authority (CA) public key and the public and private keys of a 
TLS certificate signed by this CA."
"This certificate is meant to be used with **private** services, such as a Vault 
cluster accessed solely within your AWS account."
"For publicly-accessible services, especially services you access 
through a web browser, you should NOT use this module, and instead get certificates from a commercial Certificate 
Authority, such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)."
"If you're unfamiliar with how TLS certificates work, check out the [Background section](#background)."
"## Quick start

1."
Copy this module to your computer.
1.
Open `variables.tf` and fill in the variables that do not have a default.
1.
DO NOT configure Terraform remote state storage for this code.
"You do NOT want to store the state files as they 
   will contain the private keys for the certificates."
1.
Run `terraform apply`.
"The output will show you the paths to the generated files:

    ```
    Outputs:
    
    ca_public_key_file_path = ca.key.pem
    private_key_file_path = vault.key.pem
    public_key_file_path = vault.crt.pem
    ```
    
1."
"Delete your local Terraform state:

    ```
    rm -rf terraform.tfstate*
    ```

   The Terraform state will contain the private keys for the certificates, so it's important to clean it up!"
1.
"To inspect a certificate, you can use OpenSSL:

    ```
    openssl x509 -inform pem -noout -text -in vault.crt.pem
    ```

Now that you have your TLS certs, check out the next section for how to use them."
"## Using TLS certs


### Distributing TLS certs to your servers

Distribute the private and public keys (the files at `private_key_file_path` and `public_key_file_path`) to the 
servers that will use them to handle TLS connections (e.g."
Vault).
"For example, to run Vault with the [run-vault 
module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/modules/run-vault), you need to pass it the TLS certs: 

```
/opt/vault/bin/run-vault --tls-cert-file /opt/vault/tls/vault.crt.pem --tls-key-file /opt/vault/tls/vault.key.pem
```   

We **strongly** recommend encrypting the private key file while it's in transit to the servers that will use it."
"Here 
are some of the ways you could do this:

* Encrypt the certificate using [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) and include the encrypted files in the AMI for your
  Vault servers."
"Give those servers an IAM role that lets them access the same KMS key and decrypt their certs just
  before booting."
* Put your TLS cert in a secure S3 Bucket with encryption enabled.
"Give your Vault servers an IAM role that allows them
  to download the certs from the S3 bucket just before booting."
* Manually upload the certificate to each EC2 Instance with `scp`.
"### Distributing TLS certs to your clients   
   
Distribute the CA public key (the file at `ca_public_key_file_path`) to any clients of those services so they can 
validate the server's TLS cert."
"Without the CA public key, the clients will reject any TLS connections: 

```
vault read secret/foo

Error initializing Vault: Get https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/foo: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

Most TLS clients offer a way to explicitly specify extra public keys that you want to trust."
"For example, with 
Vault, you do this via the `-ca-cert` argument:

```
vault read -ca-cert=ca.crt.pem secret/foo

Key                 Value
---                 -----
refresh_interval    768h0m0s
value               bar
```

As an alternative, you can configure the certificate trust on your server so that all TLS clients trust your CA
public key by running the [update-certificate-store module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/modules/update-certificate-store) on your server."
"Once 
you do that, your system will trust the public key without having to pass it in explicitly:

```
update-certificate-store --cert-file /opt/vault/tls/ca.crt.pem
vault read secret/foo

Key                 Value
---                 -----
refresh_interval    768h0m0s
value               bar
```



## Background


### How TLS/SSL Works

The industry-standard way to add encryption for data in motion is to use TLS (the successor to SSL)."
"There are many 
examples online explaining how TLS works, but here are the basics:

- Some entity decides to be a ""Certificate Authority"" (""CA"") meaning it will issue TLS certificates to websites or 
  other services

- An entity becomes a Certificate Authority by creating a public/private key pair and publishing the public portion 
  (typically known as the ""CA Cert"")."
"The private key is kept under the tightest possible security since anyone who 
  possesses it could issue TLS certificates as if they were this Certificate Authority!"
"- In fact, the consequences of a CA's private key being compromised are so disastrous that CA's typically create an 
  ""intermediate"" CA keypair with their ""root"" CA key, and only issue TLS certificates with the intermediate key."
- Your client (e.g.
"a web browser) can decide to trust this newly created Certificate Authority by including its CA 
  Cert (the CA's public key) when making an outbound request to a service that uses the TLS certificate."
"- When CAs issue a TLS certificate (""TLS cert"") to a service, they again create a public/private keypair, but this time 
  the public key is ""signed"" by the CA."
"That public key is what you view when you click on the lock icon in a web 
  browser and what a service ""advertises"" to any clients such as web browsers to declare who it is."
"When we say that 
  the CA signed a public key, we mean that, cryptographically, any possessor of the CA Cert can validate that this same 
  CA issued this particular public key."
- The public key is more generally known as the TLS cert.
"- The private key created by the CA must be kept secret by the service since the possessor of the private key can 
  ""prove"" they are whoever the TLS cert (public key) claims to be as part of the TLS protocol."
"- How does that ""proof"" work?"
"Well, your web browser will attempt to validate the TLS cert in two ways:
  - First, it will ensure this public key (TLS cert) is in fact signed by a CA it trusts."
"- Second, using the TLS protocol, your browser will encrypt a message with the public key (TLS cert) that only the
    possessor of the corresponding private key can decrypt."
"In this manner, your browser will be able to come up with a
    symmetric encryption key it can use to encrypt all traffic for just that one web session."
"- Now your client/browser has:
  - declared which CA it will trust
  - verified that the service it's connecting to possesses a certificate issued by a CA it trusts
  - used that service's public key (TLS cert) to establish a secure session


### Commercial or Public Certificate Authorities

For public services like banks, healthcare, and the like, it makes sense to use a ""Commercial CA"" like Verisign, Thawte,
or Digicert, or better yet a widely trusted but free service like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)."
"That's 
because every web browser comes pre-configured with a set of CA's that it trusts."
"This means the client connecting to 
the bank doesn't have to know anything about CA's at all."
"Instead, their web browser is configured to trust the CA that 
happened to issue the bank's certificate."
"Connecting securely to private services is similar to connecting to your bank's website over TLS, with one primary 
difference: **We want total control over the CA."
"**

Imagine if we used a commercial CA to issue our private TLS certificate and that commercial or public CA--which we 
don't control--were compromised."
Now the attackers of that commercial or public CA could impersonate our private server.
"And indeed, [it](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/sep/05/diginotar-certificate-hack-cyberwar) [has](
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/02/verisign_hacked.html) [happened](
http://www.infoworld.com/article/2623707/hacking/the-real-security-issue-behind-the-comodo-hack.html)
multiple times."
"### How We'll Generate a TLS Cert for Private Services

One option is to be very selective about choosing a commercial CA, but to what benefit?"
"What we want instead is 
assurance that our private service really was launched by people we trust."
"Those same people--let's call them our 
""operators""--can become their *own* CA and generate their *own* TLS certificate for the private service."
"Sure, no one else in the world will trust this CA, but we don't care because we only need our organization to trust 
this CA."
"So here's our strategy for issuing a TLS Cert for a private service:

1."
**Create our own CA.
"**
    - If a client wishes to trust our CA, they need only reference this CA public key."
- We'll deal with the private key in a moment.
1.
"**Using our CA, issue a TLS Certificate for our private service."
"**
    - Create a public/private key pair for the private service, and have the CA sign the public key."
"- This means anyone who trusts the CA will trust that the possessor of the private key that corresponds to this public 
      key is who they claim to be."
"- We will be extremely careful with the TLS private key since anyone who obtains it can impersonate our private 
      service!"
"For this reason, we recommend immediately encrypting the private key with 
      [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)."
1.
**Freely advertise our CA's public key to all internal services.
"**
    - Any service that wishes to connect securely to our private service will need our CA's public key so it can declare 
      that it trusts this CA, and thereby the TLS cert it issued to the private service."
1.
**Throw away the CA private key.
"**
    - By erasing a CA private key it's impossible for the CA to be compromised, because there's no private key to steal!"
- Future certs can be generated with a new CA.
"Methyl butyrate

Methyl butyrate, also known under the systematic name methyl butanoate, is the methyl ester of butyric acid."
"Like most esters, it has a fruity odor, in this case resembling apples or pineapples."
"At room temperature, it is a colorless liquid with low solubility in water, upon which it floats to form an oily layer."
"Although it is flammable, it has a relatively low vapor pressure (40 mmHg at ), so it can be safely handled at room temperature without special safety precautions."
"Methyl butyrate is present in small amounts in several plant products, especially pineapple oil."
"It can be produced by distillation from essential oils of vegetable origin, but is also manufactured on a small scale for use in perfumes and as a food flavoring."
Methyl butyrate has been used in combustion studies as a surrogate fuel for the larger fatty acid methyl esters found in biodiesel.
"However, studies have shown that, due to its short-chain length, methyl butyrate does not reproduce well the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behaviour  and early CO2 formation characteristics of real biodiesel fuels."
"Therefore, methyl butyrate is not a suitable surrogate fuel for biodiesel combustion studies."

The countdown as to whether fans will get their hands on No Man's Sky this year or not is now drawn to less than four months remaining before 2015 ends.
"Fans, however, can still hold their hopes up for the big release date announcement and other meaty gameplay details come October 3 as Hello Games' main man, Sean Murray, is slated do a 90-minute exclusive preview called, 'Blast Off'."
"A special event page for New Yorker Festival 2015 has revealed that an exclusive 90-minute exclusive preview of the space exploration title, No Man's Sky, is confirmed to be held on October 3 at World Trade Center in New York."
"During the event, game creator Sean Murray is set to talk with writer Raffi Khatchadourian in one on one interview surrounding the development of the much awaited indie title and to ultimately reveal or even drop a release window for the game."
This is the second time that Murray and Khatchadourian will have to sit down and discuss about indie developer's project as Sony's PS4 exclusive release following New Yorker's first broad coverage back in May.
Fans who wish to attend the said event can follow the source' link to avail of the tickets costing $45.
"Also, Murray continues to keep the hype going and tease fans to expect for more official gameplay details on No Man's Sky soon, Design & Trend wrote."
"In earlier news, Amazon UK website has now upped a pre-order page for No Man's Sky PC and PlayStation 4 console at a price around $73, apparently, more expensive than other indie game releases."
No Man's Sky is touted to be the biggest game ever created in terms of scale with a quintillion planets to explore and wil be playable on PS4 and PC platforms.
It is anticipated to launch before end of 2015 and Hello Games is said to be considering a Virtual Reality Support for the game.

"Introduction {#sec1-genes-08-00307}
===============

Hyperglycemia is a key risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome."
"Nowadays, both diseases have a substantial impact on public health and safety because they exacerbate the burden on health services \[[@B1-genes-08-00307],[@B2-genes-08-00307]\]."
These metabolic diseases result from an imbalance between the amounts of energy ingested and consumed and they are characterized by lipid dysregulation that affects energy homeostasis.
"Even though several experimental and clinical attempts have been made to control both diabetes and metabolic syndrome, their prevalence continues to rise, contributing to the estimated parallel decline in worldwide health \[[@B3-genes-08-00307],[@B4-genes-08-00307],[@B5-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Given the complexity of the molecular mechanisms that underlie these diseases, a deep understanding of these mechanisms is essential to discover new treatments that prevent the development of metabolic diseases and improve quality of life."
"In particular, the discovery and modulation of regulatory elements, such as transcriptional factors, represents a strategy for combating pernicious effects of diabetes and other complications of the metabolic syndrome."
"Although glucose is the main oxidative fuel source in eukaryotes, excessive glucose availability has detrimental effects (glucotoxicity) on organismal metabolism."
"Similar to its effect in humans, excess glucose exposure in *Caenorhabditis elegans* triggers toxic effects characterized by decreased lifespan, delayed reproduction and fertility, and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in part due to mitochondrial dysfunction \[[@B6-genes-08-00307],[@B7-genes-08-00307],[@B8-genes-08-00307],[@B9-genes-08-00307]\]."
The transcriptional factor Myc-associated factor X (MAX) belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain basic helix-loop-helix motifs (b-HLH) and leucine zipper domains.
"MAX interacts with c-Myc (also a transcription factor member of the b-HLHzip family) to form a MAX--Myc heterocomplex that binds to DNA in specific E-boxes sequences (CACGTG); this interaction is indispensable for the regulation of gene expression \[[@B10-genes-08-00307],[@B11-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Although little is known about the general mechanism that controls the MAX--Myc complex, MAX--Myc has the ability to activate or inhibit several genes that are involved in different cellular functions, including energy metabolism \[[@B12-genes-08-00307]\]."
"In fact, studies have shown that exposure of insulinoma cells to high glucose concentrations increases both c-Myc abundance and its association with its obligate heterodimer MAX to activate several glucose-responsive and de novo fatty acid synthesis genes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDK-1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthetase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) \[[@B13-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Additionally, although the involvement of MAX has not been analyzed, endogenous levels of Myc promote de novo fatty acid synthesis \[[@B14-genes-08-00307],[@B15-genes-08-00307]\], suggesting that the MAX/Myc network induces lipid accumulation via the incorporation of glucose-derived carbons into fatty acids."
"Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) is a major transcriptional regulator of lipogenic metabolism in mammals \[[@B16-genes-08-00307],[@B17-genes-08-00307]\]."
SREBP overexpression promotes its interaction with c-Myc to enhance the cellular reprograming of lipid metabolic genes \[[@B18-genes-08-00307]\].
"However, whether the MAX/Myc/SREBP network is involved in MAX/Myc-mediated activation of the aforementioned genes is unknown."
"*Caenorhabditis elegans*, a useful model to study energy balance and the regulation of lipid metabolism, has two MAX orthologous genes called MXL-1 and MXL-3 \[[@B19-genes-08-00307]\]."
"MXL-3 likely functions as a homodimer, unlike mammalian MAX; furthermore, MXL-3 does not appear to interact with other *C. elegans* Myc family members \[[@B20-genes-08-00307]\]."
*C. elegans* MXL-3 modulates lipid metabolism by controlling specific lysosomal lipase *lipl-1* and *lipl-3* genes in response to nutrient availability \[[@B19-genes-08-00307]\].
"Interestingly, global mapping and transcription factor activity analysis revealed that MXL-3 could positively regulate the *C. elegans* SREBP homolog SBP-1 \[[@B21-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Thus, it is plausible that MAX and MXL-3, in their respective species, play a critical role in regulating lipid metabolism, which contributes to the increased risk of developing obesity and related diseases."
"In this study, we characterized a novel metabolic function of the MXL-3 transcription factor in the control of systemic lipid storage."
"A specific *mxl-3* knockout nematode exhibited decreased lipid content, even in the presence of excess lipogenic substrates, i.e., a high-glucose diet."
"Mechanistically, MXL-3 underwent nuclear translocation from the cytosol in response to a high-glucose diet, leading to the activation of a lipogenic program through the transcription of *sbp-1*, thereby modulating important lipogenic enzyme genes in an MXL-3-dependent manner."
This effect was blunted by the drug metformin.
Our data demonstrate that MXL-3 is an essential regulator of lipid metabolism and strongly suggest that MXL-3/SBP-1 may be a novel target for the development of therapeutic procedures that ameliorate or even prevent metabolic diseases.

"Materials and Methods {#sec2-genes-08-00307}
========================

2.1."
"Strains {#sec2dot1-genes-08-00307}
------------

All strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) strain bank."
"The wild-type strain was *C. elegans* variant Bristol, N2 strain."
"The following mutants were used: RB1588 mxl-3 (ok1947) X, VC1886 *sbp-*1 (ok2363) III and UL1439 MXL-3::GFP unc-119 (ed3) III."
"Worms were cultured and handled according to standard laboratory protocols, as described previously \[[@B22-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Briefly, worms were grown on NGM-lite plates and maintained at 20 °C with *Escherichia coli* OP50-1 as the food source."
"When required, synchronized nematodes were maintained until the L4 larval state and transferred to new experimental NGM plates without glucose (control), with 100 mM glucose (glucose) or with 100 mM glucose plus 50 mM metformin (glucose/metformin)."
"Glucose plates were prepared at a final concentration of 100 mM by adding glucose to the solid media and then allowing to spread for at least one day; metformin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to melted media \[[@B23-genes-08-00307]\]."
"All experimental media included 49 μM 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR, Sigma-Aldrich)."
"After 24 h, nematodes were collected and excess bacteria were quickly removed with M9 buffer."
"Unless otherwise mentioned, samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until analysis."
2.2.
"Fat Storage Staining {#sec2dot2-genes-08-00307}
-------------------------

Fat storage was assayed as described previously using the Oil red O (Sigma-Aldrich) staining method with some modifications \[[@B24-genes-08-00307],[@B25-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Worms were collected with M9 buffer, washed twice with 1X PBS buffer, and suspended in 100 μL of 1X PBS, to which an equal volume of 2X buffer (160 mM KCl, 40 mM NaCl, 14 mM Na~2~EGTA at pH 7.4) containing 2% paraformaldehyde was added."
Worms were then washed three times with 1X PBS.
"After allowing the worms to settle, the buffer was aspirated, and 500 μL of freshly prepared ORO solution was added (0.5 g of ORO powder in 100 mL of 60% isopropanol; filter: 0.2 μm \[[@B26-genes-08-00307]\])."
Animals were incubated overnight with rocking.
"The dye was removed, and the samples were washed with 200 μL of 1X PBS/0.01% Triton X-100."
Worms were mounted on prepared agar slides.
"Images were acquired under differential interference contrast (DIC) and a rhodamine filter using a confocal FluoView FV1000 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)."
2.3.
"Fluorescence Imaging {#sec2dot3-genes-08-00307}
-------------------------

Fluorescence imaging was performed as described previously, with some modifications \[[@B27-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Briefly, MXL-3::GFP (UL1439) transgenic worms were harvested and washed three times with cold M9 buffer, then once with 1X PBS/0.05% TritonX-100, and fixed with buffer (50% methanol, 20 mM EGTA, 1X PBS solution) containing 4% paraformaldehyde."
Cells were permeabilized by performing two freeze--thaw cycles (liquid nitrogen/60 °C water bath) followed by gentle rocking for 24 h at 4 °C.
"After this procedure, worms were washed with 0.05% TritonX-100 in 1X PBS and incubated in 0.3% H~2~O~2~ in 20 mM sodium borate (pH 9.6) for 15 min."
"Finally, samples were washed with 1X PBS."
"Nuclei were visualized via DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining."
Fluorescence was examined at 358 nm using a confocal FluoView FV1000 microscope (Olympus).
2.4.
"RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR {#sec2dot4-genes-08-00307}
-------------------------------------------

Prior to total mRNA quantification, worms were lysed by adding 100 μL of lysis buffer (5 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.25 mM EDTA and 2 mg/mL proteinase K) and incubating at 65 °C for 10 min."
"To inactivate the proteinase K, samples were heated to 85 °C for 1 min and immediately cooled on ice \[[@B28-genes-08-00307]\]."
Total RNA was extracted by adding 300 μL of Trizol to 100 μL of worm lysate following the manufacturer's instructions.
"cDNA was obtained using random hexamer oligonucleotides and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)."
"Expression analyses were performed using Taqman (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) probes, which were detected using the StepOne (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) System and StepOne Software v2.2 (ABI instruments, Carlsbad, CA, USA)."
mRNA levels were normalized to eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene expression as an endogenous control.
2.5.
"Lipid Extraction and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Assays {#sec2dot5-genes-08-00307}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fatty acid composition was determined by producing fatty-acid methyl esters (FAMEs)."
"Total fatty acids were extracted via the chloroform-methanol (2:1, *v*/*v*) method and incubated at 95 °C for 1 h in 0.2 mL of toluene, 1.76 mL of methanol and 0.04 mL of H~2~SO~4~ \[[@B29-genes-08-00307],[@B30-genes-08-00307]\]."
"The concentration and composition of FAMEs were evaluated, as described previously \[[@B31-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Briefly, Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D."
"× 0.25 μm, Agilent) containing ultrapure helium as a carrier gas, and 1 μL of each sample was injected at a 10:1 split ratio."
"The initial oven temperature was set to 150 °C, increased to 310 °C at 8 °C per min, and held for 15 min at this temperature."
Mass detection was performed as previously described for a JMS-GC System \[[@B31-genes-08-00307]\].
Fatty acid abundance was expressed as the percent of total fatty acids in the N2 control strain for each sample.

"Results {#sec3-genes-08-00307}
==========

3.1."
"MXL-3 Is Involved in Lipid Accumulation Due to High Glucose Exposure in *C. elegans* {#sec3dot1-genes-08-00307}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To investigate whether the MXL-3 transcription factor facilitates the excess lipid accumulation induced by high glucose exposure in *C. elegans*, semi-quantitative analysis of neutral lipids stained with ORO was performed in fixed wild-type (N2) and *mxl-3* null mutant (*mxl-3/ok1947*) animals."
"Consistent with previous reports \[[@B7-genes-08-00307]\], we found that high glucose exposure for 24 h significantly induced lipid accumulation in N2 animals, as demonstrated by an increase in the intensity of ORO staining ([Figure 1](#genes-08-00307-f001){ref-type=""fig""}A,B)."
"Next, we determined whether lipid accumulation due to a high-glucose diet is influenced by MXL-3."
"Ablation of *mxl-3* substantially reduced ORO staining compared with that observed for the N2 control strain ([Figure 1](#genes-08-00307-f001){ref-type=""fig""}A,B), whereas the augmented lipid storage observed in N2 under high glucose was blunted in MXL-3-null animals, even when the mutant was grown under the same conditions, suggesting that fat accumulation is mediated by the MXL-3 transcription factor."
3.2.
"MXL-3 Actively Shuttles between the Cytoplasm and Nucleus in Response to High Glucose {#sec3dot2-genes-08-00307}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MXL-3 actively shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in response to nutrient availability \[[@B19-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Therefore, it seems plausible that glucose might affect the cellular localization of MXL-3."
"To determine whether high glucose exposure modifies the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of MXL-3::GFP, transgenic worms were grown on media containing high glucose (100 mM) or no glucose (control) for 24 h. Glucose exposure resulted in the major accumulation of MXL-3::GFP in the nucleus compared to that in the controls, suggesting that glucose augments its regulatory activity ([Figure 2](#genes-08-00307-f002){ref-type=""fig""}A,B)."
"To verify if nuclear localization correlates with transcriptional activity, we measured several known target genes of MXL-3 by performing quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)."
"The expression levels of the specific lysosomal lipases *lipl-1* and *lipl-3* were markedly downregulated after N2 nematodes were fed high glucose for 24 h compared to the levels in worms grown under control conditions; this effect was abolished in *mxl-3* null mutants ([Figure 2](#genes-08-00307-f002){ref-type=""fig""}C)."
"Thus, MXL-3 nuclear localization induced by glucose enhances the transcriptional repression of these genes."
3.3.
"MXL-3 Regulates Lipid Synthesis Through SBP-1 {#sec3dot3-genes-08-00307}
--------------------------------------------------

As observed in mammals, the transcription factor SREBP ortholog in *C. elegans*, SBP-1, induces lipid synthesis by activating lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (*pod-2*), fatty acid synthase (*fasn-1*), elongase (*elo-2*) and ∆12 desaturase (*fat-2*) \[[@B32-genes-08-00307]\]."
"A previous study employing an assay of transcriptional activity proposed that MXL-3 positively regulates SBP-1 expression \[[@B21-genes-08-00307]\], suggesting a new physiological role for MXL-3 in the lipid biosynthesis signal transduction pathway."
"To determine if SBP-1 induces lipid accumulation in an MXL-3-dependent manner under high glucose conditions, we first measured the mRNA expression levels of sbp-1 during glucose excess."
"As expected, the expression of sbp-1 mRNA was significantly higher in nematodes treated with high glucose ([Figure 3](#genes-08-00307-f003){ref-type=""fig""}A), suggesting augmented activity of this transcription factor."
"To establish MXL-3- and SBP-1-dependent gene regulation, we grew *mxl-*3 null mutants (ok1947 strain) on high glucose and measured the mRNA levels of both *sbp-1* and some of their known target genes."
"MXL-3 was necessary for full *sbp-1* expression, as the *mxl-3* (ok1947) null mutant failed to properly activate *sbp-1* gene expression ([Figure 3](#genes-08-00307-f003){ref-type=""fig""}A)."
"Similarly, genes that were highly expressed under glucose, specifically *pod-2*, *fasn-1*, and *fat-2*, were blunted by the absence of MXL-3 ([Figure 3](#genes-08-00307-f003){ref-type=""fig""}B--D), indicating that this factor is an additional element required for the appropriate expression of SBP-1-dependent genes."
"*elo-2* expression was decreased under high glucose, even in the N2 and *mxl-3* null mutant strains."
"To determine to what extent MXL-3 contributes to glucose-regulated gene expression through SBP-1, similar studies were performed in *sbp-1* mutants."
"As expected, the expression levels of *pod-2*, *fasn-1*, *elo-2* and *fat-2* were not induced in response to a high-glucose diet ([Figure 3](#genes-08-00307-f003){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Taken together, our data suggest that MXL-3 might be important for promoting a selective lipogenic program that is dependent on a high-glucose diet through SBP-1."
3.4.
"MXL-3 Is Required to Maintain Fat Stores and De Novo Fat Synthesis {#sec3dot4-genes-08-00307}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Since MXL-3 promotes transcriptional changes under a high-glucose diet through SBP-1, we determined whether the observed changes were also reflected in fat and lipid metabolism."
"Using GC/MS, we measured the composition of free fatty acids (FFA) in the *mxl-3* mutant strain."
"Consistent with ORO staining ([Figure 1](#genes-08-00307-f001){ref-type=""fig""}A), worms lacking MXL-3 showed decreased FFA content ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}A and [Figure A1](#genes-08-00307-f006){ref-type=""fig""})."
"We also analyzed the three FFA lipid classes, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and found that MXL-3 triggers a metabolic shift that decreases SFAs and PUFAs ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}B,D); MUFAs were not modified by the absence of MXL-3 ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}C)."
"In *mxl-3* mutants, we observed a decrease in stearic acid (18:0), a fatty acid obtained by elongation that is dependent on ELO-2, an SBP-1-dependent elongase ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}F)."
"Additionally, in the absence of MXL-3, the 18:1n9/18:2n6 (oleic acid/linoleic acid) ratio was decreased ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}G and [Figure A2](#genes-08-00307-f007){ref-type=""fig""}), while oleic acid was increased ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}H), suggesting FAT-2 (Δ12) desaturase blockage controls the conversion of fatty acids to PUFAs ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}E)."
"When the *mxl-3* mutant was subjected to a high-glucose diet and its lipid profile was analyzed by GC/MS, we did not observe FFA accumulation or SFA/PUFA changes, which were normally observed in the wild-type strain."
"MUFA content was slightly increased by glucose ([Figure 4](#genes-08-00307-f004){ref-type=""fig""}A--D and [Figure A1](#genes-08-00307-f006){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Together, these data suggest that MXL-3 is as necessary as SBP-1 for the adequate synthesis and elongation of fatty acids, and MXL-3 is involved in the same steps mediated by SBP-1."
These findings reinforce the hypothesis that MXL-3 acts through SBP-1 to regulate lipid metabolism.
3.5.
"Metformin Decreases Lipid Overload through MXL-3 {#sec3dot5-genes-08-00307}
-----------------------------------------------------

Metformin, a drug that is broadly prescribed to treat type-2 diabetes and obesity, is beneficial because it modulates several transcriptional elements that affect lipid storage \[[@B33-genes-08-00307]\]."
"To evaluate the effects of metformin on the glucose-dependent accumulation of lipid droplets, the wild-type N2 strain was grown with high glucose and simultaneously treated with metformin (glucose-metformin)."
"Glucose-dependent lipid droplet accumulation was diminished in response to metformin, as evidenced by the reduced fluorescence of ORO staining close to control levels ([Figure 5](#genes-08-00307-f005){ref-type=""fig""}A)."
"Since we showed that glucose availability modulated the cellular location of MXL-3, we next evaluated the subcellular distribution of MXL-3 upon treatment with metformin (24 h)."
"Interestingly, metformin-treated worms grown in glucose-containing media showed a diminishment of nuclear content of MXL-3::GFP from their nuclei, resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation similar to untreated worms ([Figure 5](#genes-08-00307-f005){ref-type=""fig""}B)."
"Thus, the localization of MXL-3 in the cytoplasm upon metformin treatment in the presence of glucose may be one mechanism underlying reduced lipid storage."
"Consistent with the exit of MXL-3 from the nucleus, expression of the MXL-3 target gene *lipl-1* increased to the same extent, while *lipl-3* expression did not recover ([Figure 5](#genes-08-00307-f005){ref-type=""fig""}C,D)."
"Similarly, when MXL-3 was inhibited by metformin, the MXL-3-dependent expression of SBP-1 target genes, including *fasn-1*, *pod-2*, and *fat-2*, returned to control levels in N2 nematodes ([Figure 5](#genes-08-00307-f005){ref-type=""fig""}E--G)."
"Furthermore, based on MXL-3 cytoplasmic localization, when wild-type worms were grown in the presence of both glucose and metformin and then lipid-related gene expression and lipid stores were assessed, FFAs were decreased by metformin versus the glucose group and mimicked the lipid levels observed under control conditions, even in the presence of high glucose ([Figure 5](#genes-08-00307-f005){ref-type=""fig""}H and [Figure A1](#genes-08-00307-f006){ref-type=""fig""})."
"This effect was more evident for MUFAs and PUFAs, which returned to control levels ([Figure 5](#genes-08-00307-f005){ref-type=""fig""}I--K)."
"Specifically, the fatty acid moieties that had a clear tendency to decrease to control levels under glucose-metformin conditions were the myristic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and eicosapentaenoic acids (14:0, 18:0, 18:1n9, 18:2n6, and 20:5n3, respectively, [Figure 5](#genes-08-00307-f005){ref-type=""fig""}L)."
"This lipid profile was surprising because it was similar to the *mxl-3 null* mutant profile ([Figure A1](#genes-08-00307-f006){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Based on these results, metformin decreased lipid storage and modified the FFA profile via an MXL-3- and SBP-1-dependent mechanism."

"Discussion {#sec4-genes-08-00307}
=============

In this study, we determined that MXL-3 is activated by a high-glucose diet and, together with SBP-1, promotes fat accumulation."
This effect was mediated by the increased expression of genes that mediate fatty acid synthesis and desaturation.
"Furthermore, lipid accumulation under glucose-rich conditions was also dependent on MXL-3-dependent lipolysis."
"Moreover, the anti-diabetic drug metformin prevented MXL-3 activation, suggesting a new key role for MXL-3 in the mechanism underlying metformin action on lipid accumulation."
"Thus, MXL-3 is a transcription factor that acts at the nexus of metabolic pathways to stimulate fat accumulation."

"MXL-3 Senses Nutrient Availability and Regulates the Obese Phenotype during High Glucose Exposure {#sec4dot1-genes-08-00307}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key finding of our study was the identification of MXL-3 as a primary activator of an obese phenotype that has previously been shown by others to be derived from lipid accumulation via high glucose ingestion \[[@B6-genes-08-00307],[@B7-genes-08-00307],[@B8-genes-08-00307],[@B9-genes-08-00307]\]."
Myc-associated factor X contains a basic helix--loop--helix motif (b-HLH) and a leucine zipper domain and functions at the core of a transcription factor network that controls diverse members of the Myc family.
"Indeed, the heterodimer MAX-Myc binds to E-box sequences (CACGTG) to activate or repress the transcription of several genes, including those for glycolysis \[[@B10-genes-08-00307],[@B11-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Importantly, in several processes such as the cell cycle and apoptosis, there is a strict requirement for MAX to ensure adequate Myc function."
"However, in *Drosophila* spp., a Myc mutant lacking a Max-interaction domain retained partial activity \[[@B34-genes-08-00307]\]."
"*C. elegans* contains two MAX orthologs, MXL-1 and MXL-3, the latter of which regulates lipolysis in response to nutrient levels \[[@B19-genes-08-00307]\]."
"However, the role of MXL-3 in the development of metabolic diseases, such as obesity dependent on a high-glucose diet, remains poorly studied."
"Therefore, the importance of MXL-3 activity in the control of lipid accumulation under high glucose exposure was evaluated in this study."
"According to O'Rourke and Ruvkun, MXL-3 moves to the cytoplasm during nutrient deprivation and de-represses lysosomal lipolysis (lipophagy)."
This is a critical mechanism by which most cells catabolize lipids as an energy source \[[@B19-genes-08-00307]\].
"Interestingly, we observed that MXL-3::GFP shuttled from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under high-glucose conditions, suggesting MXL-3 is a sensor of intracellular glucose metabolism; indeed, during nutrient deprivation, MXL-3 was expelled from the nucleus, whereas under high-glucose conditions, MXL-3 occupies the promoters of its targets to modulate gene expression."
"Consistent with the glucose-dependent occupancy of MXL-3 in the nuclei, the expression levels of *lipl-1* and *lipl-3* were diminished by glucose excess, resulting in repression of the lipophagic process."
These findings suggest that MXL-3 activation is responsible for lipid accumulation.
4.2.
"MXL-3 Converges in the Complex Lipid Biosynthesis Signaling Pathway {#sec4dot2-genes-08-00307}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Energy homeostasis is maintained by an extremely complex network of signaling pathways that operate to mediate different aspects of the fatty acid balance to maintain energetic resources."
"SBP-1, known as SREBP1c in mammals, acts as a critical lipogenic transcriptional factor that promotes lipid synthesis by inducing genes such as *pod-2*, *fasn-1* and (*elo-2* \[[@B32-genes-08-00307]\]."
"However, less is known about its upstream regulation."
"Recently, employing a transcriptional activity assay, MacNeil et al."
proposed that MXL-3 positively regulates *sbp-1* expression \[[@B21-genes-08-00307]\].
"Since MXL-3 increased lipid storage and given the key role of SBP-1 in lipid metabolism, we tested the possible relationship between both transcription factors."
"Interestingly, in animals that lacked *mxl-3*, we showed diminished *sbp-1* gene expression."
The effects of glucose observed in wild-type strains and the near doubling of *sbp-1* expression in the N2 strain with glucose were avoided in *mxl-3* mutants.
"Similarly, we observed a dependence on MXL-3 for the adequate expression of SBP-1-dependent lipogenic genes, including *pod-2*, *fasn-1* and *fat-2*, when glucose was administered."
"Based on these findings, transcriptional lipogenic processes are not only regulated by SBP-1 but also by MXL-3."
"Thus, we propose a new critical physiological role for MXL-3 in the complex lipid biosynthesis signal transduction pathway."
"Fat regulation in living organisms, including *C. elegans*, involves a complex network of genes and signaling pathways."
"Here, we showed that MXL-3 is in part responsible for the observed transcriptional changes that result in lipid accumulation during a high-glucose diet."
Our analysis of fatty acid composition using GC/MS showed that the absence of *mxl-3* decreases total FFAs in a similar fashion as previously reported in an *sbp-1 RNAi* strain \[[@B9-genes-08-00307]\].
"When we analyzed FFAs grouped in families according to their saturation levels, we showed that the absence of the MXL-3 transcription factor decreased SFAs and PUFAs but did not change MUFAs."
"These results might be explained by blockage of the FAT-2 (∆12) desaturase, an enzyme that catalyzes a critical SBP-1-dependent step, because there was a decrease in calculated activity leading to a decrease in the conversion of fatty acids to PUFAs."
This led to decreased de novo synthesis from acetyl-coA because the genes that carry out this process were also reduced.
"For de novo synthesis, two multifunctional enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (POD-2) and fatty acid synthase (FASN-1), both of which are SBP-1 targets, are necessary to synthesize palmitic acid (16:0) \[[@B32-genes-08-00307],[@B35-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Palmitic acid is integrated into TAGs or is modified by fatty acid elongases and desaturases (*elo* and *fat* genes, respectively) to form a variety of long-chain UFAs \[[@B35-genes-08-00307]\]."
"In *mxl-3* mutants, we observed a decrease in stearic acid (18:0), a fatty acid obtained by elongation dependent on ELO-2, a palmitic acid elongase that is itself dependent on SBP-1 \[[@B32-genes-08-00307]\]."
"In addition, the ratio of 18:1n9/18:2n6 (oleic acid/linoleic acid) was decreased while oleic acid increased, confirming the decreased synthesis of PUFAs in *mxl-3* mutants; similar levels of PUFAs were observed in an *sbp-1* RNAi strain \[[@B9-genes-08-00307]\]."
These changes in fatty acid composition may affect energy storage functions as well as membrane properties associated with signal transduction mechanisms.
"Thus, the key finding of our study is the identification of MXL-3, which acts in concert with SBP-1, as an essential component for fatty acid metabolism."
"Interestingly, the overlapping functions of these two transcription factors might be explained by the fact that both are helix--loop--helix proteins with canonical E-box binding activities \[[@B36-genes-08-00307]\], thus suggesting a possible interplay between these transcription factors to regulate lipid metabolism."
4.3.
"MXL-3 Is a New Player That Mediates the Protective Effect of Metformin against Lipid Accumulation {#sec4dot3-genes-08-00307}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for type II diabetes and obesity \[[@B33-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Previously, metformin was found to decrease lipid concentrations in *C. elegans* \[[@B23-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Therefore, we speculated that metformin might be responsible for regulating the biological function of MXL-3."
"We demonstrated that metformin enhance cytoplasmic localization of MXL-3, even in glucose-treated worms."
"These results are consistent with the fact that metformin triggers caloric restriction-like effects in *C. elegans* \[[@B37-genes-08-00307]\], promoting changes in MXL-3 cellular localization that have been observed during dietary restriction \[[@B19-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Similar effects on nucleocytoplasmic shuttling have also been described with other transcription factors, such as FOXO1 (Forkhead box protein O1) and CRTC2 (CREB Regulated Transcription Coactivator 2) \[[@B38-genes-08-00307],[@B39-genes-08-00307],[@B40-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Thus, our studies strongly suggest that regulation of MXL-3 pathway crosstalk with SBP-1 by metformin plays an important role in ameliorating lipid accumulation, a mechanism that was unknown until this work."
"MXL-3 might modulate the cellular localization of DAF-16/FOX0, a pro-longevity and lipid-mobilizing transcription factor of the FOXO-family that is cytoplasmic under physiological conditions, because loss of MXL-3 function induces its nuclear localization, suggesting a relationship between both transcription factors \[[@B41-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Interestingly, a recent study suggested a positive feedback loop involving DAF-16 and AMPK, the latter of which is an evolutionarily conserved sensor of cellular energy status under low energy levels or metformin \[[@B42-genes-08-00307],[@B43-genes-08-00307],[@B44-genes-08-00307]\]."
"Consistent with this, we speculate that metformin, via AMPK induction, may inhibit MXL-3 to activate DAF-16 and trigger the activation of genes required for β-oxidation and desaturation, such as *nhr-49*, to diminish systemic lipid accumulation."
These possibilities warrant further exploration.

"Conclusions {#sec5-genes-08-00307}
==============

In summary, our data showed that the increased expression of the transcription factor MXL-3 is associated with an increased activity of SBP-1, suggesting that this couple mediates the upstream regulation of lipid metabolism in nematodes exposed to a high-glucose diet."
These observations imply that increased MXL-3 activity in the organism is an important factor in the development of pathogenesis of lipid accumulation.
"Therefore, we reasonably infer that MXL-3 antagonist (such as metformin) may serve a suitable mechanism for the pharmacology."

Perioperative management of pediatric patients with craniosynostosis.
"Craniosynostosis, premature closures of the skull sutures, results in dysmorphic features if left untreated."
Brain growth and cognitive development may also be impacted.
Craniosynostosis repair is usually performed in young infants and has its perioperative challenges.
"This article provides background information about the different forms of craniosynostosis, with an overview of associated anomalies, genetic influences, and their connection with cognitive function."
"It also discusses the anesthetic considerations for perioperative management, including blood-loss management and strategies to reduce homologous blood transfusions."
"This spring, space fans had a virtual campfire to flock to: the new Cosmos series, which aired on Fox and National Geographic for 13 science-filled episodes."
"The series attracted at least three million viewers a week, generated discussions (positive and negative) on social media, brought host Neil deGrasse Tyson to even higher heights of fame, and once again, showed the general public how neat space is."
"Well, guess what."
"According to producer Seth MacFarlane, Cosmos could come back for a second run — which would supercede the predecessor series from the 1980s, narrated by Carl Sagan!"
"“Early, preliminary discussions for a 2nd season of #Cosmos– If you want to see more of the great @neiltyson, tweet him your love!” MacFarlane wrote on Twitter yesterday (Dec. 3)."
"His comments follow a posting on Reddit that surfaced in a couple of news reports yesterday, one from a reported viewer of a deGrasse Tyson talk in New York City:

“I just attended a presentation by Tyson at NJPAC in Newark, NJ,” the posting read."
"“During the Q&A portion, he told the audience that he’s meeting with producers tomorrow in NYC to discuss the next “season” (for lack of better term) of COSMOS."
"He didn’t go into further detail, but thought this was interesting since up until this point the updated show was just considered a one-off series (ie 13 episodes).”

We’ll keep you posted as more news arises."

That is I can not connect to 10.0.2.15 to which devstack prompted me to connect.
"I tried to switch the networking mode in VirtualBox from NAT to Bridge, then an error popped out saying something like ""the NAT name already exists""."
I checked out the VirtualBox documentation but did not really understand.

Accessing BIOS on laptop with broken screen

The screen on my laptop (Samsung NP350VC) is broken and I use it only through an external monitor."
After changing from UEFI to Legacy Boot I can no longer access the BIOS through the external monitor (it won't output over HDMI or VGA until past this stage).
Is there a method by which I can access this and re-enable UEFI?
"A:

Open the laptop and try  flushing BIOS back to defaults by removing the battery and/or setting the respective jumper."

"Microsoft Pays Netscape $750 Million to Settle Antitrust Suit

Thursday May 29th, 2003

Several people wrote in to tell us that Microsoft has agreed to settle the private antitrust suit filed against it by Netscape Communications Corporation last year."
"Microsoft will pay AOL Time Warner, Netscape's parent company, $750 million to end the litigation."
"In a related agreement, Microsoft will give AOL a seven-year royalty-free license to use Internet Explorer and a long-term license to use its Windows Media 9 Series technology."
The two giants have also agreed to work together on digital media initiatives and establish interoperability between the AOL Instant Messenger and MSN/Windows Messenger networks.
"In addition, Microsoft will give AOL more technical information about Windows and help AOL to distribute its software to some PC vendors."
If AOL/TW stops funding the Mozilla project through Netscape it will most certainly set back Mozilla development.
It will not kill it off though.
It may have if this happened around the time Mozilla was around 0.8 or still in the milestone stages.
But now the community and other companies that depend on Gecko would keep development going.
Of course we can always hope that AOL will end up using Gecko over IE.
Humans have mastered flight over a hundred years ago.
"It's time for pigs to follow suit ;)

Firstly, mozilla is (disjoint) dual licensed under GPL and MPL, in fact."
"Secondly, AOL/TW does not own all the moz code (there are external contributors)."
"Thirdly, the MPL doesn't allow AOL/TW to terminate everyone's mozilla license just because it doesn't want to work on the codebase anymore."
Well so much for the Netscape browser.
I think that is why Mozilla is trying to create a name for itself with Firebird.
They knew the end of Netscape was soon to come.
I did not think it was possible but Microsoft finally killed Netscape off.
RIP.
Seems a bit premature to assume that.
Although my first fear was also that this would mean an end to embedding Gecko within AOL.
Can anyone confirm this though?
"It seems to me to be rather a waste to have built Gecko up to the standard it's at now, just to let it fall by the wayside."
"More importantly though, how many of the top Mozilla developers still work for Netscape?"
Seems to me many of them work elsewhere.
"Then again, it also seems that a couple of them have recently joined Netscape's ranks..."
So I wouldn't yet assume Netscape is dead.
This could just as easily just be the first step in a Netscape comeback!
Nowhere in the any of the articles including the AOL/MS press release does it state that the agreement mandates that AOL must use IE.
MS may be thinking that they put one over on AOL.
Just wait.
MS has to provide AOL with OS details and use the Windows desktop to promote AOL software.
I am of the belief (keeping my fingers crossed) that the next version of AOL's software will include Gecko.
"Why do I feel this way?->

1."
For one thing I.E.
and Media Player are not really cross platform and MS has no intention to make its software work better on any other platform.
Have you ever tried to use I.E.
on the Mac?
It is awful.
No wonder Safari was developed.
"Sure the mac platform may only have ~5% of all users, maybe as high as 10% if you only count home users."
Many Mac users have selected Apple for its ease of use software and this is just the type of user who would select AOL.
With AOL desperately trying to keep its user base would AOL opt for software which potentially might alienante/turn away 5 to 10 percent of its users?
2.
MS can not be trusted.
Why would AOL become anymore dependent on MS software and technologies with the history the company has of not fully living up to past agreements it has made.
Has MS really conceeded the online market to AOL.
What are MS's plans for MSN?
Could a year into the agreement couldn't MS make I.E.
and MS Media Player work better with MSN than AOL.
If MS does this the only option for AOL would be to take them to court.
MS doesn't really care if they are sued.
It is likely AOL would welcome another cash donation to drop another suit.
I believe AOL will not trust MS to screw them if AOL becomes too dependent on MS software.
This is why I believe the next version of AOL will include Gecko.
"As to the question as to why Gecko has not been included in AOL software, other than for the Mac?"
I look at it this way.
AOL had to make it look as though it was seriously testing Gecko for mass roolout completely replacing IE.
Thus the Mac used Gecko.
AOL would not have the same barganing power with MS in this suit if it had rolled out Gecko for Windows as well as the Mac; AOL had to continue to use I.E.
"Now that AOL has negotiated this deal, a deal where Microsoft is obligated to promote AOL software on its OS desktop, can AOL finally rid itself of most of its ties to MS and IE and roll out AOL software based on Gecko."
Now MS will have to compete more or less fairly with AOL.
"No more tricks with their software, such as making IE work much beteer on MSN."
I hope I am right.
"In any case, AOL is sure to keep Gecko development moving forward just in case MS pulls a dirty trick on them ."
AOL will at the least keep Gecko updated and current in case they have to quickly switch over to Gecko for their browser engine.
Who would trust MS to live up to an agreement given their history.
AOL better keep Gecko/Firebird around and updated for insurance if they do not switch to Gecko and actually go for IE.
Just because the beta is based on IE does not mean the final version will be based on IE.
But it probably will.
I'm hoping that AOL have only got the IE for 7 years thing so they keep their options open.
"As for Netscape, that never really had anything to do with the AOL client."
"AOL would have been free to develop just their own rendering engine if they had wanted to, but they chose to develop Netscape."
"After years of everyone I know using IE, I'm finally coming across people (ok, techies) using Netscape or Mozilla without me even mentioning it."
"If the techies are using it, then they will start installing it on the friends/parents/grandparents computers too."
At least I hope they will.
As the browser war is finally ended with the AOL/M$ agreement.
What is the point for a commerical company to continue the investment on a non-profit mozilla.org project?
"Since most of home users' computers were pre-installed with windows system which are IE only or preferred, and we have 7 years agreement with IE, AOL just has no more incentive to promote mozilla/Gecko browser."
The only hope of mozilla might be rely on the success of the Linux Desktop which is the only land not yet invaded by IE!
> The only hope of mozilla might be rely on the success of the Linux Desktop which is the only land not yet invaded by IE!
"Well the only platforms that really have IE is Windows and Mac, and on Mac IE is losing ground quite fast to Gecko and Safari/khtml."
"So very likely, the only place where you will be able to find IE in a not too distant future will be on windows systems, which is it self losing worldwide market share."
In light of this the Gecko engine being cross OS places it in a very favorable position vs IE (especially since MS have now decalerd that IE 6.01 will be the LAST EVER standalone IE version).
"If users will not be able to update to the next version of IE without purchasing a new version of Windows, then IE is no longer free."
"If users want advanced features, beyond what IE 6 offers, such as tabbed browsing, pop up blocking, etc."
then more users will look to browser alternatives.
Hopefully this is were Gecko will fill the void.
How many users will be happy when they find out they cannot update their browser?
Hopefully users will switch to an alternative browser.
"If AOL releases its next version of AOL using IE, will there have to be more than on version--one for those using pre-Longhorn Windows and another version of AOL for Longhorn."
Will each new version of Windows break AOL software.
Another reason for AOL to switch to Gecko for Windows.
I need some advice.
I currently design my webpage to look great on both Mozilla and IE.
Should I abondon Mozilla?
"I hate to do it, but all this negative press against Netscape/Mozilla is getting to me."
"You should design to the standards, not for any particular browser."
Don't worry if the page doesn't look exactly the way you intended it to in every browser.
There's no way you can try your page in every version of every browser on every OS with every resolution and color depth setting.
"Here's what to do:

1."
Design your page while looking at it in your favorite browser.
2.
"Validate the page to ensure it adheres to web standards, and use tools like the JavaScript console to ensure there are no JavaScript errors or warnings."
3.
"Try the page in some other popular browsers -- IE, Mozilla, Opera, and Safari or Konqueror if possible."
"If some browser does not show the page correctly, you can try to work around the problem, but always be sure to report the bug."
"After you've done this, there's a decent chance your page will look good for nearly every visitor."
"If you test in only IE and don't ensure the page adheres to standards, you lose the risk of turning away 5-20% of your visitors depending on the content of your site."
I was about to post something similar.
I would imagine that $750 million will pay for Mozilla development costs from the beginning and for years to come.
"We all get this great browser for free, and M$ foots the bill."
And this is bad how exactly?
Doesn't matter.
Let's say I buy a $500 suit and wear it to a job interview and it impresses my interviewees and I get a sweet job.
"With my earnings, I buy a Ferrari."
"The money from my employer did not pay for my suit, but still I can consider that the suit was more than paid for by my salary."
AOL-Time Warner is the one who at the end will dispose the money (directly or indirectly) because we all know how management changes at the corporation has resulted in AOL-Time Warner executives been replaced by non AOL ones.
Now is the time for Sun (or IBM or even Red Hat) to buy Netscape just to insure MS does not have an absolute hold on the way the web is seen.
"Red Hat is important to the equation because they are a big proponent of Gnome which uses Mozilla, Galeon and soon Epiphany (GNOME is dropping Galeon for upcoming Gnome 2.4) KDE centric Linux distros and Apple use Konqueror engine, so no hope to getting from that side."
Huh?
AOL site is still AOL site.
Netscape portal and the entire Netscape side of the business can be sold to some suitable party.
Why is that impossible?
AOl-Time Warner keeps saying they want to reduce their debt load which is very close to $30 billion.
How do you think they are going to do that?
"1) they will sell or divest out of most of the cable TV delivery companies they own or partially own (not necessarilly the cable channels like CNN, etc which they are going to keep), 2)Sell units that are not essential to their business line (Netscape, etc."
"), 3)Cost cutting (layoffs, increase efficiencies, reduce overhead expenses, etc."
"); 4) Increase revenues (advertising, collaboration, marketing agreements, e-commerce, stabilize subscription base, etc)

People tend to think when a company is not doing well financially they will sell bad business lines."
"On the contrary, sometime they are better off selling ""crown jewels' from where they can raise more cash."
"(BTW, AOL is still very profitable, problem is they are not growing enought to satiate corporate/stockholders greed/return on investment)."
Maybe now is the time for S. Case and some other investors to buy back AOL out of Time Warner.
Am sure Time Warner will resist selling AOL division because they would be selling it at a low stock price after they merged a few years back when AOL was at a high stock price.
(There are plenty of precedents for companies buying at higher price and selling later at a depressed price; e.g Novel buying WordPerfect for several hundred millions dollars and then selling it to Corel for a fraction of what they'd paid.)
"> Now is the time for Sun (or IBM or even Red Hat) to buy Netscape just to insure MS does not have an absolute hold on the way the web is seen

Um, why would anybody have to buy NS?"
Mozilla and the Gecko engine is the property of Mozilla.org NOT Netscape.
"That is, Netscape took steps already 5-6 years ago to ensure that noone (ie MS) could just buy out the competition."
"If you are talking about who will pay the programers sallaries, well IBM at least already have several fulltime employees working with Moz code."
It doesn't look very good.
We should not be bowing to IE or everything we work for would be gone to waste.
We need World Standard Code and perhap Gecko technology.
"IE can't accomplish this and yet it is still buggy and filled with some security holes... Now that AOL had bowed to IE, so it will be taking longer for the non-IE browser to take over the world with more than 50% of the world share...

What is really interesting is what *other* details are in the deal, e.g."
what commitments AOL actually made to adopt MS-technology.
"If they made commitments, they are history."
"If, on the other hand, they just use the $750M as war money to come up with something *innovative*, they might have a teeeeeeeny chance to survive :)

IM interoperability??"
They've still a monopoly in AIM and ICQ.
WMP9?
They've a great competitor in Real!
"And most importantly, using IE for 7 years??"
Firebird's FASTER than IE.
Did these execs ever used their own products?
"FCC chairman, son of Colin Powell (yep, another mini-dynasty in the increasingly stratified American oligarchy), supports further media consolidation through relaxation of ownership rules."
"I don't want to get started about it, so I'll stop now."
Why is it all Bush's fault?
Most of the articles point to between Microsoft and AOL that work it out and came to an agreement of some sort.
SUN and Microsoft aren't even close to an aggreement and Bush and nothing to do wtih it etiher.
It's all in your head!
It said they're not disbanding the Netscape division.
Did it say anything about Netscape the Browser?
"Understand this: what is in the best interests of AOL/TW and what is in the best interests of Mozilla intersects, if at all, on in a few places; and AOL/TW's management will do what is best for AOL/TW's stockholders, not what's best for the Mozilla community."
Predictions: AOL for Windows will continue to be based upon IE for 9.0 and 10.0 .
AOL for OS X will continue to be based on Gecko.
"Netscape the Corporation will continue to move its resources toward the portal strategy that has failed them lo these many years, because AOL/TW management is media-oriented and don't see the point in having a software client except as a way to move eyeballs to their content."
"Netscape the Browser, at least on Windows, will die the death of a thousand cuts as resources are shifted to Mozilla for OS X or other non-Mozilla projects."
"Eventually, the AOL client on OS X will adopt Webcore, Netscape will stop releasing new browsers (a return to the eternal 4.7xxx days) and Mozilla will become defacto a RedHat/IBM project."
"I'd be happy to be demonstrated wrong, but that's my immediate thought."
"It would have been nice if this agreement happened years ago, when Netscape was a corporation itself and needed resources to improve its browser."
"Now that Microsoft has won, the loss of money is a relatively small setback for them."
They will gain the money back with their monopolistic/satanic tactics.
America Online should have settled for something better than the use of Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player.
These are things Microsoft wants.
Now AOL is helping Microsoft defeat RealNetworks.
I wonder if AOL's choice to abandon its agreement with RealNetworks was due to the promise of a monetary reward from Microsoft.
"""Now AOL is helping Microsoft defeat RealNetworks."
"I wonder if AOL's choice to abandon its agreement with RealNetworks was due to the promise of a monetary reward from Microsoft."""
AOL haven't necessarily abandoned their deal with RealNetworks; the Windows Media agreement is non-exclusive.
"That said, AOL do seem to be moving away from Real recently, with deals such as the one with Dolby to use AAC (the same codec that's used by Apple's iTunes Music Store) for Radio@AOL."
"That said, long live competition."
It helps.
Real does have a very atrractive subscription plan--so does Yahoo platinum.
"Many people say Real has a nasty habit of billing people unawares (""free trials"") They have fixed this.. but my father was a victim."
Their latest software (which isn't as bad as people think.. although the ads are horrendous.. and its slow to start.. it does give you a clear choice via radio button and tells you exactly when you will be charged.. if you choose the platinum (pay) plan.)
"http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=9802
Claims:
""The rumour is that all Netscape Gecko code has been pulled from future versions of the AOL client, and when Netscape 7.1 and AOL Communicator ship in a month or so Gecko will be scrapped entirely."
"75 highly skilled people would get the axe, many of them working on the mozilla.org project, with the remaining 10-20% reassigned to other jobs."
"To top all this, it seems that there has been a ""suggestion"" from management so that people with @netscape.com email addresses start switching their emails to @aol.com."
"Does anyone need seed the writing on the wall?"""
There is absolutely no indication that AOL-TW is going to drop the Mozilla Project.
"Out of a fraction of that $750 million in cash, the Project could be kept afloat for years."
All this means is that AOL-TW has the option of using IE in its AOL client for the next 7 years--if it wants.
"Plus, AOL-TW gets a cross-marketing deal with MSN."
Good for them.
Whatever.
Notice what AOL-TW did not agree to.
They did not agree to give up Mozilla.
"Thus, we're going to keep pouring it on."
I don't know much about these things but I do know that AOL has had some problems capitalizing on their investments lately and that pooring money in Netscape does not generate a lot of revenue.
A lot of people have an interest in keeping mozilla alive.
"However, netscape is pretty much a dead brand that will forever be associated with the (lost) browser wars."
"So, let me put it this way: If I were a Netscape employee, I'd be looking for a new employer."
Killing off netscape seems like a perfect way to cut cost at AOL and it's only a matter of time somebody brings a clue bat to the AOL headquarters.
You should realise that Netscape isn't just a browser.
It is a complete portal (Mac IE even defaults to it.)
"Also the websites from CNN, etc."
are managed by Netscape people.
"Looking at the current Gecko/XUL technology, AOL will probably create a browser completely based on XUL and Gecko at some point."
This will allow for easy updates and easy crossplatform extensions.
"I consider the fact that AOL, a company that invests a lot in Mozilla, gets money (from MS) a good thing."
It's sad to hear such defeatism on this board.
Don't you all realise that none of us are powerless in the question of whether AOL uses Gecko?
We all have the power to make it so that AOL simply cannot afford to keep using IE in light of Gecko's superiority.
"Sure, Gecko is much better than IE's rendering engine now - all we need to do is making it so this is simply incontovertible."
"Secondly, only the most negative of Open Sourcers would believe that AOL has a chance if it relies on Windows being dominant for the next SEVEN years."
"There are two possibilities: either Microsoft wins its DRM battles, etc, and successfully kills off Linux, BSD, OS X, or at some point in the next seven years a significant number of computer users will move away from the Win32 platform - either way relying on Windows is a dangerous business ploy."
"Similar events at Apple a few years ago, excpet for one detail."
Apple's agreement in return for Microsoft cash mandated the use of IE.
"Some forcast the end of the browser wars then, especially on the MacOS."
But look at how history played out for Apple.
Ever since the agreement mandating the use of IE ran out Apple has been working hard to become less dependent on Microsoft.
Apple now has Safari.
The iApps are a huge success.
"I I forget the name of the application, but Apple even has metting presentation software."
Next I expect Apple to beef up Appleworks so that users can move away from MS MacOffice.
"People gasped at the MacWorld annpouncement a few years back that Gates ""paid"" (actually bought 150 million shares of non-voting Apple stock) Apple to make IE the default Mac browser."
People said this was the worst thing Apple could have ever agreed to and would spell the doom of the MacIntosh.
RThis was not true.
What this did was allow Apple some breathing room at a time when the compony was cash strapped.
This was a very smart move by Steve Jobs!
"The Apple situation is similar to the AOL/Netscape deal, though the AOL/Netscape deal has important diffefrences."
Apple made was good for Apple.
There is one major difference between the Apple deal and the AOL/Netscape deal.
In the Apple deal there was the mandate that Apple must ship IE as the default browser.
With the AOL/Netscape deal AOL recieves a liscence to use IE for seve years.
"There is no mandate in the settlement stating that AOL MUST use specific MS software (IE, Media Player)."
The major difference in this settlement is that MS is mandated by the terms of the settlement to promote AOL and its software on the Windows desktop.
There is NOTHING in the settlement stating that the AOL software MS must promote has to include any specific MS software.
The AOL software could include competting software such as Gecko or Firebird/Thunderbird.
This settlement is a win for AOL.
It gives AOL some breathing room during a financial crunch.
On the surface it seems like a bad settlement allowing MS to once again paly the winning hand.
I do not believe this is so.
Look to history and the Apple/MS deal a few years back.
This was a win for Apple.
The AOL/Netscape-MS settlement will be a win for AOL.
Mozilla will come out on top.
Matbe now is the time to invite Steeve Jobs to join the AOL/Netscape Board of Directors.
We don't have to worry about this for some time.
Parsons still says he'll not drop Netscape.
There's still too much bargaining power that'd be lost if they do sell or stop the project.
It's getting bigger every day.
If M$ had offered AOL money and a free licence to use IE and Windows Media Player before the antitrust case it would have been viewed as a violation of antitrust laws.
Now it seems as their *punishment* for violating such laws they get to do all this *above board* so to speak.
You gotta hand it to Bush.
"No wonder he has to pause and say ""errmmm..."" every so often when he speaks."
He has to remember where he is and what day is is today.
At the moment there are still far too many web sites out there which just do not work on Gecko.
"Of course this is not a problem with Gecko, but with incompetent web designers, or designers without the time/money/inclination to redesign from old 'cross browser' (read of course IE/NS4.7) code to standards compliant code."
It is also a little unforgiving of certain things which IE users would not notice - such as servers serving the wrong MIME types (e.g.
trying to display a JAR archive as it was served as text/plain).
"Linux does have a good chance of encroaching on Windows territory as far as the desktop goes, but not until a lot of choice is taken away from the user!"
"Knoppix Linux for example is very easy to install on the desktop, and picks up almost all hardware attached to the PC."
"However, the general desktop user will get very confused over the sheer quantity of programs installed, and even what most of them do (what is EMACS?"
GIMP?)!
"Linux needs a dedicated project to setting up a usable desktop for the average user - one desktop environment, the cream of the crop of the software, and maybe rename some of the software to reflect better what they do (Mozilla Browser and Mozilla Mail will work, GIMP would be better as GNU Image Manipulator)."
"Anyway, we know that at least Mozilla has a loyal fanbase - which is growing."
I have converted a good handful of people from IE!
It seems like many of the comments on this topic are forgetting the most important thing about AOL these days: the fact that they are AOL Time Warner.
"SmileyBen said ""We all have the power to make it so that AOL simply cannot afford to keep using IE in light of Gecko's superiority"", but AOL-TW is not a technology company."
"No matter how good the Gecko renderer is, IE and WMP offer something Gecko never can: a built-in distribution network for TW content via MSN's channels, right there with every new XP install."
"MSN is no longer an important competitor to AOL, as they now share a common threat: raw Internet access, which is devouring the market share of both major online services as US connectivity growth slows and mature users lose the training wheels."
"To the folks at Rockefeller Plaza, MS is a business partner; a real competitor is Viacom (CBS)."
I suspect that you misunderstand.
"By ""Innovation"" they don't mean technical innovation, they mean money making innovation."
A big part of this deal seems to involve moving Time Warner media online in Microsoft proprietry formats.
"Time Warner probably wants pay per view internet video, paid for downloadable music and various other ways of making money on the internet."
Microsoft wants to ensure that people who want this content are locked into using windows / wmp 9 / Internet Explorer.
"In fact it probably doesn't care if they use Internet Explorer or not (allegedely, fewer people work on IE than on MS Works) - after all IE doens't make them any money."
That's the kind of 'innovation' being offered here - the building of a money making media network.
"""Time Warner probably wants pay per view internet video, paid for downloadable music and various other ways of making money on the internet."""
AOL already has ties with Real.
As far as I know AOL could just as easily set up pay for view using the Real formats.
This is not reason to switch to MS proprietary formats.
Even so the deal with MS is not exclusive so the content may be offered in more than one format.
AOL may simply take the money and run.
"Nothing in the settlement, as far as I understand it, obligates AOL to use MS software or file formats."
"If you missed the news, Microsoft is going to shelf Internet Exploder."
"May I quote Brian Countryman, a Microsoft apparatchik:

<quote>
Legacy OSes have reached their zenith with the addition of IE 6 SP1."
Further improvements to IE will require enhancements to the underlying OS.
"</quote>

Just to make clear what this means."
There will no longer by any stand-alone Internet Exploder or any patches to keep old Windows versions alive.
Now everyone has to buy the whole Windows Media Desktop package.
Here is a slightly off-topic (re)post to help you get the story together and why XUL - http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3213 - is so important.
As I see it the browser war is over and now the desktop war is on.
"Just recently, for example, the Munich city council decided to move 14.000 desktops from Windows to Linux, see the write-up of the story in CNET @ http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-1010740.html?tag=cd_mh

So where does XUL come into the picture?"
HTML is the markup for browsers and XUL is the markup for desktops.
"Unfortunately, the W3C leadership doesn't get it."
"To quote from Tim Bray's weblog:

<quote>The Browser Still Matters."
"Finally, there was a thread that said that the notion of running everything through the browser was broken anyhow, and what we really needed was something like WinForms, that would give the developer fine layout controls and richer UI apparatus like they used to have back in the days of Visual Basic."
This is another example of people Not Getting It.
Why do you think the users turned away from VB to the browser?
Because they by and large didnít like what the VB programmers of the world did with those fine layout controls and rich UI apparatus.
"I can remember like yesterday a Content Management conference about 1997, a woman from a big computer company talking about how great it was when they switched their CM system over from custom clients to the browser: ďItís so great!"""
"The browser is so limited, so they had to throw away three-quarters of the buttons and sliders and pulldowns and options, and just do it with hyperlinks and simple forms... it was so much easier to use!Ē

For heavy authoring and graphics and so on, you need a native application."
"But a huge majority of business data processing is you interacting with a database off on a server somewhere, and as far as I can see, a Web Browser is still the best way to do that."
WinForms?
Pshaw!
"</quote>

Heard about XUL, Tim?"
I guess not too busy with the semantic web and RDF.
Welcome to the XUL revolution.
"If this was the first time I listen to people declaring ""the death of Netscape"", I would be really worried."
"I am though, since I've seen AOL Time Warner making a lot of nonsense decisions all along (let's not talk about booting Skip Caray off the TBS booth...)
But honestly, I've heard so many times about the death of Netscape, it doesn't really make me fear the worst."
"I am no techie, I am just a regular user."
"I don't make builds, I don't tinker with any code."
"And certainly, at the height of the browser wars I wasn't a Netscape fan (I thought IE 4.0 was the best)."
"Some years, computer magazines, CDs, downloads and using all major browsers to the point of exhaustion, I consider Mozilla/Netscape/Mozilla Firebird the best out there."
It has made me more aware of the open source movement.
"It has encouraged me to look for alternatives to Microsoft (openoffice.org, linux)."
I have told some of my friends about Netscape 7.02 and they changed to it and all I get is positive feedback.
"I really hope mozilla doesn't fade into the sunset, I think it's starting to gain momentum and Microsoft's decision of making IE SP1 the last standalone IE release should be seen as an opportunity for all mozilla people."
"Many people out there doesn't know there's a choice, an alternative."
But the word is slowly but steadily spreading.
"So, all in all, I will be worried only when I see that press release saying ""no more Netscape browsers""."
"And the only one I've read about ""no more browsers"" so far it's Microsoft's."
Even if mozilla dies there still is another alternative that is multiplatform and faster then Firefox which is Opera.
Opera maybe commercial but you don't have to buy it and all the advertisements that are in the browser are a couple of links at the top (with google adds) which only change once in awhile.
"Opera has more functionality then Mozilla and is faster then Firefox; (as of Opera 7.5 Preview 4) and it is very customizable with skins, color schemes, and the ability to customize almost all toolbars."
Even if something happens to mozilla there is still an alternative which it's developers do a really good job of making and they also listen too the people when it comes to bugs and improvements too the browser and it is also the most advanced browser for cell phones.
PS.
Opera also works very well with internet download manager which means you don't have too change anything in the file types section.
PPS.
The information and comparison is based on preview 4 and the other preview releases of 7.5 (which you can get in the beta testing section of the forum at www.opera.com)which you should use because they are better then the last major release.

News Release - Manitoba

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES INCREASED FUNDING FOR HIP, KNEE AND CATARACT PROCEDURES TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES FOR MANITOBANS

– – –$5.3-Million Investment Will Significantly Add to Number of Surgeries Performed: Friesen

The Manitoba government is investing more than $5.3 million to significantly increase the number of hip replacements, knee replacements and cataract surgeries in Manitoba in 2019, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today."
"“Manitoba patients deserve better health care sooner and that includes reducing the time they wait for priority procedures,” said Friesen."
"“As we streamline services, co-ordinate better service delivery and adopt innovative ideas that improve patient care, we can invest in additional hip, knee and cataract surgeries for Manitobans.”

More than 4,100 hip and knee replacements and 12,900 cataract surgeries were performed in Manitoba in 2017-18."
"The new investment will ensure at least 1,000 more hip and knee replacement surgeries are performed in 2019, a number which represents a nearly 25 per cent increase, the minister noted."
"The new investment will also fund at least 2,000 additional cataract surgeries next year, a 16 per cent increase, he added."
"“Our orthopedic and cataract surgery teams in Winnipeg have done an excellent job in increasing the number of procedures possible with existing resources, while ensuring safe and quality care,” said Réal Cloutier, president and chief executive officer of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority."
"“This important investment by the Manitoba government leverages their efforts and will make it possible for patients to get access to these high-demand services sooner.”

Additional cataract surgeries will take place at Misericordia Health Centre while additional hip and knee surgeries will be performed at Concordia Hospital, Grace Hospital, Health Science Centre Winnipeg and the Boundary Trails Health Centre in southern Manitoba."
“With efficiencies come opportunities.
"I commend the outstanding work of our Boundary Trails Health Centre team, which has provided a solid foundation to build on,” said Jane Curtis, chief executive officer of Southern Health–Santé Sud."
"“Today’s announcement represents yet another opportunity to partner together and build a sustainable health-care system that will meet the needs of residents, now and into the future.”

Increasing the number of hip and knee replacement surgeries and cataract surgeries was previously recommended by the Wait Times Reduction Task Force as a means to reduce wait times for care."
"“The reality is that we are seeing an increased and sustained demand for these procedures as our population ages,” said Dr. Jack McPherson, co-chair of the priority procedure wait times reduction committee of the Wait Times Reduction Task Force."
"“We are very pleased the government of Manitoba adopted our recommendation, and believe it will significantly augment the progress we have made to date in completing more procedures and ultimately reducing the amount of time patients currently wait.”

The minister noted today’s announcement is part of the province’s work to improve how care is delivered in Manitoba."
Innovative changes implemented since 2016 are also enhancing Manitobans’ access to care.
"Those innovations include offering cataract surgeries using freezing rather than sedation to patients who meet the clinical criteria, offering same-day hip surgery to reduce long hospital stays, and implementing a hip and knee clinic to reduce the number of people referred for surgery."
"“The health system transformation process allows the opportunity to look broadly at what services are offered and to create a plan focusing on increasing capacity and improving outcomes for all Manitobans,” said Friesen."
"“This will help ensure the long-term sustainability of the health-care system by providing consistent, reliable care and enhancing access for families.”"

Two weeks ago today, someone turned in one of our copies of Allegiant."
"I checked it in and, as expected, saw that it was on hold for another student."
"I printed out the hold notice, then got one of our narrow sticky notes and wrote the student’s last name and the date on it."
"I remember thinking, as I sometimes do (because I’m a nerd about names) that I liked the look and feel of this student’s name as I wrote it down."
Just had a pleasant combination of consonants.
Like I said: nerd.
"I then looked up the student’s class schedule, found out where she was at that moment, and wrote the room number on the hold notice."
I handed it to one of our student library aides to be delivered.
"Later that day, the student came to the library, got her book off the holds shelf, and checked it out."
We check out Allegiant a lot.
It’s the recently-published finale to a very popular trilogy; the movie based on the first book is still in theaters.
"So I don’t remember, honestly, if my memory of this transaction was for this student, or for someone else checking out the book, or how many different kids I said the exact same thing to."
"To some girl at about the right time — perhaps to this girl — I smiled as I handed her the book, made a comment about how she must be excited to finally get it, and then recommended that she have some kleenex handy as she read it."
This particular copy of Allegiant was due today.
The girl with the satisfying last name is dead.
She was hit by a car while riding her bicycle on Easter evening and died last night.
"When you work in the schools, you end up knowing an awful lot of people — especially in a smallish community like ours, where you have a pretty decent chance of recognizing any name you see on the news."
A lot of educators develop the habit of half-consciously scanning arrest records and news stories for familiar names.
"Our student’s name hasn’t been released by the media, but when I saw that evening that there had been a bike-car accident involving a 13-year-old, and saw the location, I knew that this was almost certainly one of our kids."
The following day that would be confirmed.
I’d learn that she was one of my husband’s students.
Other devastating details came to light.
"For two days we held out hope, and then we learned that it was over."
Queued up the emergency phone tree at about 9 pm.
Spread the word.
Picked out a blue outfit to wear in her honor because it was her favorite color.
"As far as I really know, the entirety of my relationship with this little girl was that I processed a hold for her, and I put her picture and name in the yearbook."
"She was a fairly regular library patron, based on her circulation history, but not one of the ones who interacted a lot with me."
"Still, I feel heartbroken."
It feels deeply personal to me.
I don’t know how (or if) people avoid thinking about all of the connections.
"My head and heart are full of her parents, her siblings, her friends who I see red-eyed in the halls at school today, her teachers who are trying to seem strong."
I am thinking about the driver.
"I am thinking about the adolescence and adulthood she won’t have, about her infancy and all her family’s hopes and dreams for her."
"I’m thinking about the book and wondering if she finished reading it, whether it will come back to the library, what I should do with it if it does."
I’m thinking that is a stupid thing to be thinking about.
"Although it is a vastly different situation, I’m thinking about my student M—-, who died on May 12 of last year."
She was upset about a break-up and ended up throwing herself under a train.
I was on maternity leave and all I could think was whether things might have been different if I’d been at school that week instead of at home with my own baby.
"M—- and I had been relatively close; I’d been her English teacher for a few years, and had tried to help her with some bullying/bad friend issues in the past."
"Given the dynamics of the failed relationship, I probably would have been one of the first people she would have come to talk to if I’d been there."
I’m reliving my feelings of guilt and regret.
"I’m thinking about the baby I held, hugging him close to me as M—-‘s name hit the news, and my solar plexus, that day."
"I know one day soon I’ll have to let my little boy get on his bicycle and ride out of my arm’s reach, out of my sight."
"I’ll have to trust that he’ll be safe, that he won’t trust a crosswalk with his life, that he won’t ever let a broken heart stop beating."
It’s hard to fathom having the strength to let go on a day like today.
"I’m thinking about how my coworkers must be reliving the loss of another student, just a kid, who took his own life last year."
Loss is tied to loss.
"Our principal reminded us this morning that this week’s tragedy might stir up pain from unrelated events, that we should look out for our colleagues even if they didn’t personally know the deceased."
It was a good thing to say.
I didn’t know how hard this would hit me.
"It is good to remember that in all of the different reactions people have to something like this, none are likely to be unique."
“No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.
"I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid."
"The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning."
I keep on swallowing.
"At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed."
"There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me.” C. S. Lewis wrote that in A Grief Observed, following his wife’s death."
It seems like a perfect description of today.
"He goes on to describe a sort of juxtaposed need for isolation and company, wanting others to be nearby but finding conversation too much to bear: “If only they would talk to one another and not to me.” It’s true that I want to hide under my desk with a box of kleenex, but simultaneously I want to walk, want to be in the back of a room where other people are talking."
"I want to be sleeping or perhaps just staring at a wall, but I also want to be doing something, anything, to feel like I am in some way helping."
"I feel wrapped up, muffled, in Lewis’s invisible blanket of sadness."
"It isn’t a warm blanket, but it is well-worn and widely shared."
The following post is a slightly modified version of an essay I wrote and presented for the members and coaches of the Invitational Summer Institute for the Boise State Writing Project.
"The “assignment” was, more or less, to compose and share a piece that introduced ourselves to the group in terms of who we currently were as people and educators, and what factors played into that identity."
"The pieces that resulted were a bouquet of robust metaphor, one bloom — flower or weed — of which was this essay in three parts."
"* * * * * * *

Part One

There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight
To me did seem
Appareled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream."
"This is a story about hubris, the over-confidence or arrogance that pops up as a tragic flaw in many of our great heroes, leading them to believe that they are invincible, that they are smart enough to control or even master their own fates."
"And if I am going to tell a story about hubris, I need to give it an epic setting, so I’ll begin my story on a pyramid…

You probably remember this from your ed psych classes."
"It’s Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which basically says that if your fundamental needs like food and shelter aren’t being met, that you have very little hope of nurturing friendships or building self-confidence or creating something beautiful."
We run into it with our students from unstable homes who consequently don’t do so hot when we ask them to explicate Emily Dickinson; you can’t analyze poetry when you’re busy worrying about the fact that your mom is dealing again and your dad is going back to prison and you don’t think there’s enough food in the house to keep your little brothers fed over spring break.
I was a lucky kid.
"My parents wanted, loved, and took care of me."
I didn’t know that we didn’t have much money.
"I was happy, confident, secure."
Early on I made my nest on a kid’s equivalent of the peak of Maslow’s pyramid.
I had every reason to believe that I’d live happily ever after in the land of self-actualization.
And why not?
"We’ve talked about tracking in schools, about Dinosaur Group and Eagle Group, and since this is a story about hubris I’ll admit that I was Queen of the Eagles."
"Thinking about Johnston, I realize that being so bright turned me into a fixed-frame thinker – not the sort who assumes she can’t, but the type who assumes that she is so smart that everything ought to come easily."
And my assumption panned out – and kept panning out.
Music and math came easy to me.
"Writing, reading – I was reading chapter books in kindergarten."
"I typed 100 wpm in sixth grade, which is the year I first took the SAT and scored highly enough to go to college."
"Sure, I couldn’t kick a ball or climb a rope – what purpose was there in that anyway?"
(You see now how fixed in place my view of my own abilities were.
I would never climb a rope.
I was not a runner.
I was no good at soccer.
I was born that way and would always be that way.
"It wasn’t worth trying to change, because it was unchangeable."
"If I had video of my panicky tantrums as my parents tried to convince me to keep trying to learn to ride a bike, we could all have a good laugh right now.)"
"Sheer smarts took me through school, into college on scholarship, to national conventions where I gave keynote addresses and won awards."
"People told me I was so good at things, that I was so smart."
"I demurred, finding the polite words to downplay and deflect, because I’d learned long before that being a smart girl didn’t tend to win you many friends."
"I’m not sure I ever worked at anything, and when I got bad grades in tough college classes, it was always the professor’s fault."
"If you’re finding me a bit distasteful now, you can join the club; I’m president, of course."
"This is what I believed in my early 20s: I believed that I would marry my best friend, that we would do our student teaching and both become teachers, that we would wait a respectable number of years and then have four children, that we would live in our beloved home until we outgrew it, at which point we would rent it out as an investment property, that we’d live a good life surrounded by both of our families, that we’d likely never be rich but that we’d be comfortable and happy and have many grandchildren."
I believed these things would transpire because everything I had ever wanted had been easy for me to get in the past.
"Part Two

The saddest painting I ever saw
was on the carpet in my friend’s hallway
where he tripped one night
carrying a gallon of red."
I married my best friend.
"We did our student teaching simultaneously, sucking all the equity out of our home to do so."
I got a one-year job and then was lucky enough to get the job I have now.
He was passed over for job after job because he didn’t have coaching experience.
The economy crashed.
We tried to scrape by on my salary and whatever makework he could get.
There are a dozen different really hard stories tucked into and beneath this paragraph but I’m going to set all but one of them aside for now.
"For a dozen reasons that seemed excellent at the time, we waited and waited to try for a baby – and then when we finally got around to it, it didn’t work."
"It was supposed to have been easy; after all, if some of my dimmest students could get knocked up without trying, surely a pair of dedicated smartypants like us could make it work, right?"
We emptied our very tiny savings account into an appointment with a fertility doctor who didn’t even look at us for the first twenty minutes of her sales pitch for in-vitro.
"They gave me pills that almost gave me a stroke and had me inject myself, tearful with nerves, with syringes directly into my gut."
"I had tried to tell the doctor that I was extremely sensitive to medications and should start with a lower dose; when she didn’t listen, I ended up hyperstimulated, which means that you simultaneously produce enough eggs to become Octomom three times over."
"I remember sitting there with an ultrasound wand wedged in an uncomfortable spot, reading failure and the waste of 23 potential babies on the display screen, while they tried to press me into trying a treatment that would cost half a year’s salary."
They prescribed a round of cancer medication made from the urine of postmenopausal women but neglected to mention the astronomical cost or the tremendous risk of fatal birth defects.
"We walked away, took a couple hundred bucks and drove to Seattle."
"We watched the Broncos play the Bulldogs on a tiny Red Robin television and joked that if Kellen did well, and we got pregnant on the trip, that we’d name the baby after him."
"If it were a girl, we’d name her Ikea."
And then we got pregnant.
"And then, on the day before our first prenatal appointment, on my 31st birthday, we became abruptly not pregnant."
I know we’re not the first couple to have a miscarriage.
"I know I share this grief with some of you, and that some of you have much harder stories to tell."
"But this is the hardest story I’ve had to tell so far, though, and now that I’m six months out (I would have been 37 weeks today) I can see that this is the chapter of my story in which I finally started to learn some things."
What have I learned?
I’ve learned how much I hate euphemisms.
"It is bad enough to lose a house, which we did last summer – but to lose a baby?"
That’s just careless.
"I’ve learned how good hope tastes after months and months of despair, how light you feel when you know that you are going to have a baby, what a delicious secret it is to have."
"I’ve learned about changing your prayer midway through as you sit white-knuckled at the red light before the ultrasound clinic — knowing, even if you don’t want to admit it, that there is no longer any point in praying that everything will be okay, and that all there is left to pray for is strength."
"I’ve learned about a level of physical pain that I never imagined existed, and how the emotional pain lasts far longer than the memory of the physical."
"I’ve learned how long it takes for lost blood to replenish itself, and how your head will pound and spin after climbing the stairs to your bed or your classroom long after your colleagues have forgotten that you were ever sick."
I’ve learned how lonely recovery from an essentially invisible injury can be.
"I’ve learned that regardless of how smart you are, you cannot will yourself to stop hemorrhaging."
"I’ve learned that regardless of how smart you are, you cannot will yourself not to pass out in the emergency room corridor when the nurse steps away."
"I’ve learned that regardless of how smart you are, you can still end up with frighteningly low blood pressure on a gore-soaked gurney with a steady stream of strange men peering at your private parts."
"You can’t smart your way out of seven or eight IVs, a breathing tube that scrapes your throat raw, the blinding lights of the OR."
"Regardless of how smart you are, you can’t make yourself stop shaking with terror as they slide you onto the operating table."
"I’ve learned that I am not smart enough, or strong enough, or good enough at anything, for this."
I do not know how to deal with this… yet.
I am broken.
I need to be a teacher.
I need to be a supportive wife for a beloved husband in crisis.
I need to be a supportive daughter and sister for a family that has always leaned on me to provide their levity.
I need to have thoughtful discussions about agency and learning models and inquiry.
"But look, I’ve fallen all the way down the pyramid…."
I have no security….
How can I dream?
How can I philosophize?
How can I be the strong one when my substance is as compromised as a novel dropped in a hot bathtub?
"Part Three

I can’t sing with the other animals."
"Because it’s
hard to know what an animal will do when it
stops singing."
"It’s complicated, you know; it’s just

be a small child again (or, lacking that, perhaps a horse or a bluebird or a housecat…)

sleep until someone wakes me up and tells me that they have solved my problems while I was away

wander quietly on a beach, collecting white pebbles

I do the first thing – often, too often probably – and I do the fourth thing, last weekend."
There are many things dotting the gritty sand that stretches out to meet the Pacific on the far side of Oregon.
"Driftwood, bits of rusted litter, alien uprooted plants, broken seashells, belly-up corpses of crabs so small I could hold a dozen in my hand."
"At certain times of day, there are mollusks and starfish and squishy green things that look like mold but that swell shut to protect their centers if you poke them."
"At other times of day, ruffled lines of sea foam arch along the sand like tidal rickrack."
"And, depending on the beach, there are pebbles – little bits of agate and quartz and basalt – that have been beaten and battered and ground up by the sea until they are perfectly smooth, rounded coins of stone."
"I cannot be a small child again, no matter how hard I wish."
"But like a small child, I can gather my treasures."
"And so I take a 35-cent thrift store jar, and I roll up my pants to keep the hems from getting sandy, and I hunt for white pebbles."
For every several hundred pebbles there will be a white one.
"For every dozen or so white pebbles, there will be one that is perfect in color – no black veins or yellow spots."
"And every so often, one of those will be just the right size and thickness to become a worry stone like the one that my grandfather, whom I never met, found on the Gulf of Mexico while in the Coast Guard at the beginning of WWII."
"He carried it in his pocket when his first marriage failed, when he met and married my grandmother, when their first infant daughter died, when he told his employer that he had cancer and was fired, when his brothers said they’d take care of his family – lying, because as 1950s Catholics they never acknowledged his second family as legitimate, when he moved his family to California in a last ditch effort to find work, when he knew that he wouldn’t live to see his daughter – my mother – turn eleven."
His pebble was black; I don’t know why I am hunting white ones.
"Probably because black sea pebbles often dry to reveal they’re actually gray or brown, but a white pebble is white wet or dry."
Probably because white pebbles are hard to find but easy to spot.
I have always liked the illusion of a challenge.
The pebbles were supposed to be a metaphor.
"And they are, but the problem is that they are a metaphor for too many different things right now, so I can’t finish connecting the dots."
"Depending on my mindset, the metaphor is one of survival or despair."
It fits both patterns.
"The thing, though, that sticks in my mind now as I tell myself to stop picking at the scab forming over this draft, is this: as I meander down the beach collecting pebbles, the ocean fills my ears and I lose track of time."
"And when I look up, I see that I have covered far more ground than I imagined."
"I have been looking so intently at the ground beneath my feet that the distance has vanished before me, and I am so, so far from where I began."
A dog will break your heart every time.
"How can it not break your heart when it takes residence within it, turning around and scratching and tugging until it creates a form-fitting nest – stretching and enlarging your heart so that it has a greater capacity for love?"
"The dogs and cats who share our lives are not children, true; they hold a different, but not lesser, spot in our hearts."
"No matter what happens, they are always happy to see us."
"They greet us at the door (yes, even cats often do this) with glad posture, eager for our touch and the sound of our voice."
They seek us out for company and security as well as for food and shelter.
"Even when we work long hours, forget to fill the food dish, neglect to clean the litter box, get angry and yell – they forgive, forget, and never stop loving."
"Their love is unwavering, unquestioning, and unconditional."
Loving and being loved by a pet is probably the closest we mortals can get to understanding God.
"Losing a pet is like losing a little part of your heart, and it is no easier when you get to name the time and circumstances of that loss."
"I daresay it is harder; yes, you get to say good-bye, but you have to bear the weight of an impossible but necessary decision."
"Before Ryan and I knew each other very well, we were instant messaging one another."
"As I recall, he mentioned wanting to get up and get a Coke, but couldn’t because he had a sleeping puppy on his lap."
"Having not known he even liked dogs, I asked him about the puppy and he told me about Emmy, a little black-and-white poodle who was a spry 12-year-old at the time."
"This was one of the little moments in our relationship that tumbled together like gears in a lock until I suddenly found myself in love with him – can’t explain it, but it was."
The gentleness and humor in his words as he talked about his “puppy” revealed a side of him I hadn’t known before.
"I’ve always had a fondness for “spotty dogs” – what more sophisticated people would refer to as “parti-colored.” To my mind, Emmy was just beautiful: white with black ears and Snoopy spots along her back, a dark blaze running down to her black nose."
"Most of her colors were fading to shades of gray, but it was clear she’d been a real beauty."
"Her temperament was on the neurotic side, even for a toy poodle, but she surprised the Bakers by letting me hold her from time to time."
"I remember her super-sonic barking when people came into the house and the way she bounded, Pepe LePew-style, across the yard after a tennis ball (which she rarely actually retrieved)."
"She would stand on her back legs to take a treat, even stealing it gently from between pursed lips."
"My favorite thing was when she would perk her ears just right and become Bat Dog, her black ears flaring out like goofy wings."
Yesterday Emmy had to leave us.
"It was hard to let her go, even for a relative newcomer to her life like myself."
Loss is never easy to bear.
I read a story yesterday about a man and his dog on the road to Heaven.
"The story described Heaven as a sun-warmed farm without fences, behind a simple gate that looked as though it had never been closed, where both the man and his companion were welcome."
"I like to think of Emmy sniffing that gate, recognizing the smell of friends and family gone before her, and bouncing all bat-eared into a world where she will always be warm and young and eagerly waiting for the day when she can bellow her greetings to her mortal family."

Did You Have Juice?"
"Have you ever walked into a little shop on a whim, and felt like you'd stepped right into a wild kaleidoscope of fascinating and beautiful objects?"
That's how I'd like to envision this blog.
"Golden light slipping in through a picture window, reflecting off of the shiny doodads and trinkets, pooling warmly around the occasional showpiece."
A hospitable cat curled up in a bookcase or on a well-worn armchair.
"Welcoming smells - apple cider in the cold months, lilacs and chamomile in the warm."
Walls cushioned with old books.
The thought-provoking next to the ridiculous.
"It's the corner shop of my mind, and Did You Have Juice?"
is its online marketplace.
The United States now has a potential opportunity to negotiate on trade and denuclearization through the global oil industry.
"Whether it was intentional or not, the Trump administration has found itself with an ace up its sleeve and an opportunity to get more out of China than most expected."
China will likely end up being the last major customer of Iranian oil.
"In April, China purchased 9.6 million barrels per day of oil from global suppliers, according to China’s own data."
"That is almost as much oil as the U.S. or Saudi Arabia produces in a typical recent month, and yet China produces almost no oil of its own."
"Much of that oil imported by China comes from Saudi Aramco, which has ownership stakes in Chinese refineries and has long-term contracts for that market."
A lot of the oil imported by China also comes from Russia via a new pipeline between the two countries.
But China is always looking for more and cheaper oil to feed its growing refining and petrochemical manufacturing sector as well as its growing strategic petroleum reserve.
It will not be easy for China to continue or increase purchases from Iran.
China faces the same problems that are forcing all of these other countries and companies to abandon their relationships with Iran.
The United States can punish and fine almost any entity that violates unilateral U.S. sanctions with Iran.
"The U.S. can do this if the firm that does business with Iran also does business with U.S. entities (called secondary sanctions), and in this globalized economy almost every major business is tied to U.S. trade."
"A street money exchanger, puts US dollars in a plastic bag, in Ferdowsi St. in downtown Tehran, Iran."
"(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi, File)

If China buys Iranian oil after November 4, it will not be able to pay in U.S. dollars, the traditional currency for oil trades."
"China could pay in its own currency, yuan, because Iran is desperate enough to accept it, but China cannot pay through any bank that wishes to do business with the U.S. or that bank will face punishment from the U.S."
"Even if China pays in yuan and goes through a special bank designated to avoid business with the U.S., it cannot use the typical international wire transfer means like SWIFT."
"Nor can China pay Iran in paper yuan, because Iran has no use for that currency."
Iran cannot use yuan to pay its government employees or domestic vendors.
It is possible that Iran will barter its oil to China in exchange for goods and services such as assistance with Iran’s infrastructure.
Chinese companies are currently contracted for such projects in Iran.
"However, this will not help Iran pay its government employees and vendors or improve its economic prospects."
The best situation for Iran and for China would be if Chinese banks and Chinese oil firms could receive an exemption from the U.S. Treasury department.
"Iran could then sell oil to China, which, through its exemption, could pay Iran."
"There would probably be a cap on the amount of oil China could buy under an exemption, so that the sales would not seriously improve the Iranian economy or lessen political pressure on the Iranian regime."
"At the same time, China could get cheap oil - something it wants."
The U.S. could use sanctions waivers on Iranian oil as a bargaining chip in its ongoing negotiations with China .
"In return for waivers to purchase Iranian oil, the U.S. could seek concessions in trade negotiations (primarily lower tariffs on American raw materials, food, and products) and further assistance in pressuring North Korea to denuclearize and possibly liberalize."
China has the world’s second largest economy with few oil resources of its own.
It is always looking for a good deal on oil.
"To be clear, the U.S. doesn't have to give exemptions to China, but it could, as a powerful bargaining chip in broader negotiations."

These record-breaking drones push tech to the limit

On December 1 2016, Just Eat claimed delivery of the first takeaway meal by a six-wheeled, Starship Technologies bot."
"“I couldn’t believe my eyes when I opened the door to find a robot waiting to greet me,” said their first surprised customer."
"“It was like something out of a movie.”

It’s not the only record that robots and drones have set."
Just Eat’s autonomous delivery isn’t even the longest by a drone.
"DHL’s Parcelcopter flew packages seven miles between Reit im Winkl and the nearby Winklmoosalm plateau, while Amazon has been testing its Prime Air service in Cambridgeshire with a reported range of 10+ miles."
Drone with the biggest range?
"But these are small hops compared to Zipline’s drones, which have started to deliver blood and life-saving medical supplies across Rwanda."
The company’s fixed-wing Zip UAVs have an operational range of over 90 miles and can fly at speeds in excess of 60 mph.
Fixed-wing Zipline drones can fly up to 90 miles delivering medical supplies by parachute drop.
"The Zip aircraft are certainly fast, but they’re nowhere near the speediest drones around."
"Discounting military hardware, Teal claims that its quadcopter is the world’s fastest production drone."
"The official specs rate the speed at 70+ mph, but Teal admit that they’ve “reached speeds over 85 MPH in certain conditions.”

Fastest ascent by a drone?"
"If the Teal drone is the fastest in terms of horizontal flight, German engineer Dirk Brunner has built the fastest vertical flyer."
"In fact, he flew into the record books after his custom-made drone soared 328 feet skywards in just 3.87 seconds."
Guinness World Records officially recognises the achievement as the Fastest 100 metre ascent by a quadcopter.
"Speaking of record-breaking flights, the solar-powered AtlantikSolar drone holds the world endurance record for unmanned aerial vehicles under 50kg."
It flew continuously for 81 hours back in 2015.
The feat was designed to prove the staying power of solar UAVs and their ability to provide emergency communications or live inspection/sensing imagery.
Heaviest payload lifted by a drone?
"A Norwegian Megacopter, meanwhile, holds the Guinness World Records title for Heaviest payload lifted by a remote-controlled multicopter."
"“The aircraft lifted an incredible weight of 61kg (134 lb 7.6 oz, excluding the weight of the craft itself) when it was officially tested at the Oslo Science Park, Oslo, Norway,” said guinnessworldrecords.com."
"Finally, Intel smashed its own drone world record for Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously when 500 Shooting Star drones took to the sky for a spectacular light show."
"Flying in formation, the tiny LED-equipped quadcopters formed 3D shapes, spelled out recognisable words and painted the number 500 in the air."
You can watch the record-breaking Shooting Star drones in action here.
It’s yet another example of how drone technology is rapidly evolving.
"In the coming years, autonomous copters will whine across our skies and delivery bots will trundle along our pavements."
"High-flying, solar-powered UAVs might even be powering our Internet."
"If so, we’ll have these early drone pioneers to thank (or blame) for it."

PTR 5.2: Dire Horns

As I type, Patch 5.2 – The Thunder King – is up on the Public Test Realms."
"The initial patch notes talk about some interesting stuff, but for pet hunters there is really only one note worth reading:

Dire Horns have been added as a tamable species for Hunters that have learned the required skill."
Aspiring Dire Horn owners should seek out clues regarding these auspicious beasts.
Now the note leaves some questions open.
"Learned the required skill implies an Exotic family, or possibly a special new ‘tame dire horns’ skill."
And seeking out clues?
Sounds like a quest to me.
"But whatever the details, there is one underlying fact to remember:"
A woman has hit out at highways bosses after breaking her ankle tripping on potholes she had complained about months before.
Carol Beard was left wearing a plaster cast and had to go off work after falling in an alleyway behind her home on Paddock Street in Oswaldtwistle in December.
"Carol, who works as an assistant radiographer at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, said she was angry that the potholes had not been repaired."
"The 58-year-old, who lives on the road, said: “I am furious because it could still easily happen to someone else - nothing is being done about it."
"For me this has been terrible, I have got crutches and a big snow boot on my leg."
"“I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I have gone through.”

Carol said she had reported the issue to her ward councillor Peter Britcliffe in October."
Coun Britcliffe said he had made county hall aware of this issue on several occasions.
He said: “I am appalled by what has happened.
I told the county council that they needed to come out and they told me that they had no money to do anything about it.
“I again took this issue to the three-tier forum and told them that something needed to be done urgently.
"“I have heard off other people in the area with complaints about potholes and what is county hall doing about it?”

Lancashire County Council bosses said they will inspect the road and added that repairs had been carried out to some potholes on the street."
"Ray Bennett, highways engineer for Hyndburn, said: “We will inspect the highway to see if any further repairs are needed."
“Some potholes were reported on this road in May 2013.
"We inspected the street and any that posed a risk were repaired on June 6, 2013.”"

Investors do not expect the wall of money that has flowed into the credit market for most of the past year to dissipate anytime soon despite risk premiums on bonds falling on the back of such voracious demand, fuelling fears of a “bubble” in the asset class."
"In the latest credit investor survey by BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, some 75% of respondents, mostly investment managers, said they expect cash inflows into their funds to continue even though credit spreads, or yields over government bonds, have declined dramatically, reducing returns."
"The flow of money into credit funds in the past three months alone has accelerated, according to the survey, with 80% of respondents stating that they have seen net inflows since the beginning of July."
"This trend is not expected to reverse soon either, although it may slow in some areas."
"Barnaby Martin, credit strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch in London, said: “While some see scope for retail inflows to slow as rates rise and stimulus is removed, institutional inflows are expected to remain strong as pension funds and insurance companies address their under-allocation to credit.”

He added: “With so much liquidity, investors remain relatively comfortable about emerging micro-risks in the credit market.”

One of those is acquisition risk, but roughly 66% of respondents said they remain untroubled by this threat and have not changed their investment stance as a result."
"Martin said: “No wonder then that some respondents have begun to use the word 'bubble' in their comments to describe the outlook for credit markets.”

In a change to this year’s trend, the survey said that in the last two months there has been a slight fall in the number of investors reporting to be overweight credit versus their benchmark allocations to the asset class from 42% in July to 38% this month."
"However, this masks the fact that this month saw a jump in investors claiming to be “very overweight” rather than just “overweight”, the survey said."
"In addition, the survey showed that investors are adding more risk through duration, by shedding their overweight positions in bonds with one-year to five-year maturities and reducing their underweight positions bonds with maturities of ten years and longer."
"Martin said the latter development is likely to have been helped by a pick-up in long-dated bond issuance, and that “while investors are still underweight long-dated credit – a net 20% - the current reading is almost the least underweight in the history of the survey”."
A recreational fishing boat is often equipped with a trolling motor for propelling the boat through a suspected fish habitat while an operator fishes.
The navigation route of the fishing boat through the habitat is selected by the operator based upon a number of factors.
"The factors typically include the water depth, the water temperature including the location of thermoclines (boundaries between bodies of water with contrasting temperatures), the topography of the bottom including natural or man-made structures, the composition of the bottom (e.g., sand; rocks; weeds), the current and the location of shorelines and/or other above-water obstacles."
"A desired navigation route may also depend on the need to travel from one location to another, such as from a boat launch pad or dock to the general vicinity of a desired fishing area, or by the operator's experience and intuition."
"Once a particular navigation route is selected, the operator may desire to repeat the route a number of times while fishing."
"Originally, an operator was required to operate a trolling motor manually."
"However, the attention and time required to operate the trolling motor interfered with the fishing activity itself."
"In response, a number of systems have evolved to automatically control the operation of a trolling motor, thereby allowing the operator to devote her attention and time to fishing."
One known system controls a trolling motor to maintain a selected distance between a fishing boat and a shoreline or fixed structure.
Another system controls a trolling motor to maintain a selected water depth beneath a boat.
Yet another system controls a trolling motor to maintain a boat at a desired heading.
Another system controls a trolling motor to maintain a boat in a fixed position.
"Known control systems, however, do not provide an operator with flexibility in setting a desired route."
"As described above, a desired navigation route may depend on a number of factors combined in various ways at the discretion of the operator."
"For example, the operator may want to set a navigation route as a fishing boat is manually navigated through a suspected fish habitat while the operator monitors any or all of the above factors."
"Once a navigation route is selected, the operator may want to repeatedly navigate the fishing boat around the navigation route, either in forward or reverse order, while fishing."
"It would be advantageous to provide a system that allows an operator to select a navigation route by entering waypoint positions, or waypoints, representing successive positions along the navigation route."
"Such a system would allow an operator to select waypoints using any factor or combination of factors that is desirable, and would control a trolling motor to navigate a fishing boat between the selected waypoints."
"Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a flexible system for controlling the navigation of a fishing boat equipped with a trolling motor."
It would also be desirable to provide a system for controlling the navigation of a fishing boat between a plurality of waypoints representing successive positions around a navigation route.
"Further, it would be desirable to provide a system for controlling the repeated navigation of a fishing boat around a navigation route."
"It would also be desirable to provide a system for controlling the navigation of a fishing boat around a navigation route represented by a plurality of waypoints stored manually via a keypad or a switch, downloaded from an electronic chart, or stored automatically by the system based on actual position as an operator navigates around the navigation route."
"From Ben Kurtz:

California Labor Code § 1102 requires that “no employer shall coerce or influence or attempt to coerce or influence his employees through or by means of threat of discharge or loss of employment to adopt or follow or refrain from adopting or following any particular course or line of political action or political activity.” Furthermore, the “whistleblower” provisions at §1102.5 prohibit employers from adopting rules preventing disclosure of, or retaliating against an employee for having disclosed, “information … to a person with authority over the employee, or another employee who has authority to investigate, discover or correct the violation … if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee’s job duties.”

The memo in question quite plausibly falls into both statutory sections — advocating that someone “stop alienating conservatives” sure sounds like political activity, and warning of corporate policies and procedures “which can incentivize illegal discrimination,” and asking that the employer cease “restricting [certain] programs and classes to certain genders or races” sure sounds like information which an employee would have “reasonable cause to believe” concerns noncompliance with federal and state anti-discrimination laws."
Even better: Somebody could go to jail for this.
"Section 1103 provides: “An employer or any other person or entity that violates this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable, in the case of an individual, by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year or a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) or both that fine and imprisonment, or, in the case of a corporation, by a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000)."

Rule Allows Parade-Goers to Save Seats While Also Keeping Sidewalks Safe for Pedestrians

(Edmonds, WA) – With the popular Edmonds Fourth of July Parade just days away, the City of Edmonds and Edmonds Chamber of Commerce are reminding the community about the following items to ensure a safe and happy Fourth of July for all:

The placement of lawn chairs and other items along the parade route will be allowed after6pm Tuesday evening, 7/3/18."
"Please refrain from chaining or otherwise attaching chairs to each other and to stationary items such as trees, sign posts, etc."
"This policy is to allow parade-goers to stake out their viewing places somewhat in advance, as has been the tradition, but to also avoid the safety and access concerns of lengthy sidewalk obstructions well in advance of the Fourth."
"After 6am on July 4th streets along the parade route will be closed to traffic by the Edmonds Police Department, so personal vehicle access to the route will not be possible until after the parade clears."
Chairs and other items placed in the right-of-way along the parade route before 6pm Tuesday 7/3/18 will be removed by the Public Works Department.
They may be retrieved during regular business hours at the Public Works Building at 7110 - 210th Street SW.

"NEWARK — U.S. Senate candidate Rush Holt said his claim made Monday that ""millions will die"" if something isn't done to address global warming was reality, not hyperbole."
“I think it’s no exaggeration at all to say that millions will die.
"And in fact there’s pretty good evidence that millions already have died because of climate change,” Holt, a congressman from central New Jersey who’s seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, said in a Star-Ledger editorial board meeting this morning."
"Holt made the statement in an internet-only campaign ad, in which he called for a tax on carbon emissions."
"It drew criticism from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, who called the 15-second spot ""silly hysteria."""
"Lonegan also said it's ""highly questionable"" that global warming is a man-made problem, despite widespread scientific consensus on the issue."
“It’s not hysteria.
"It’s documented,” Holt said, saying that global warming’s effects are felt in more than just natural disasters."
"“If you talk to the World Health Organization and International Health Groups, they’ll tell you because of diseases – it’s not just from storm damage, it’s other aspects of climate change affecting our oceans,” he said."
"On Lonegan, Holt said “shouting from one soap box to somebody else’s soap box across the way is not a very effective way of advancing the public interest and helping people.”

Lonegan responded there are ""different reports, different opinions of what creates climate change."""
"""But I do know this: The kind of carbon tax Holt is promoting will destroy jobs, and according to the National Association of Manufacturers would destroy 34,000 jobs in New jersey alone,"" Lonegan said, referring to a report from the organization that said the tax would result in a loss of worker income equivalent to between 34,000 to 38,000 jobs in 2013."
The global warming ad was the fourth in a series of short issues-oriented videos Holt has put out in his underdog campaign for U.S. Senate to succeed the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
"In the Aug. 13 Democratic primary, Holt faces Newark Mayor Cory Booker, the frontrunner, as well as U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.)"
and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver.
"The winner will face the Republican who prevails in the GOP primary: Lonegan, the frontrunner, or Dr. Alieta Eck."
"In previous web-only spots, Holt has detailed his ideas on issues such as taxing stock trades, charging banks the same interest rates to borrow from the government as students and establishing a single-payer health care system."
Holt has also drawn attention nationally — especially on the internet — for his call to repeal the Patriot Act and roll back 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that allowed for large scale data collection.
"On the issues, Holt said he has been more specific and aggressive than any of his Democratic opponents."
"“I don’t hear many people out therem, certainly among the contestants in this Senate primary, calling for a carbon tax,” Holt said."
“Calling for an end to domestic surveillance.
"They’ll use some weasel words and say ‘Yes, I would like to see universal health care’ or something."
"They’re not out there pounding away at it.”

Holt also pushed back against the notion that Booker has built a better record on bipartisanship than he has."
He noted that he worked with Pennsylvania Republicans to add the Delware River to the National Wild and Scenic River program; worked with U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan (R-3rd Dist.)
to secure millions in suicide prevention funds for veterans; and worked with U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11th Dist.)
to designate the state’s Revolutionary War sites as a National Heritage Area.
“Sometimes there’s an avenue for bipartisanship.
Sometimes there isn’t.
"The skill is to be able to use one’s legislative position to advance the things that one needs to advance, "" Holt said."
"Added Holt: ""Cory Booker’s bipartisanship and bringing people together is most in evidence in areas that don’t count."
In his speaking tours.
"Whether it’s city council or the schools or the utilities here, boy I don’t see a lot of bringing people together."""
"Booker spokesman Kevin Griffis responded that ""evidently, the Congressman’s Internet was down this morning."""
"""A quick search would have turned up a long list of bipartisan initiatives — from development projects to ex-offender re-entry — that have created thousands of jobs and improved the lives of Newarkers,"" Griffis said."
"""We hope his service returns soon.”

"John Wright (poet)

John Wright (1805–1844), was a Scots poet."
"Biography
Wright born on 1 September 1805, at the farmhouse of Auchencloigh in the parish of Sorn, Ayrshire, was the fourth child of James Wright of Galston in the same county, a coal-driver, by his wife, Grizzle Taylor (died December 1842) of Mauchline."
"While he was still a child his parents removed to Galston, where he received a few months' schooling and learned to read, but not to write."
He gave evidence of powers of memory by reciting the whole of the 119th Psalm in the Sabbath school to the discomfort of his audience.
"From the age of seven he assisted his father in driving coals, and at thirteen he was apprenticed to George Brown, a Galston weaver, a man of cultivated mind, who assisted his education and placed books at his disposal."
"While still a youth Wright composed fifteen hundred lines of a tragedy entitled ""Mahomet, or the Hegira"", which he was forced to retain in his memory until he learned to write at the age of seventeen."
"In 1824 he proceeded to Glasgow, carrying with him The Retrospect and some smaller poems."
"On his arrival he saw John Struthers and Dugald Moore, who approved his work and assisted him to go to Edinburgh."
"There he found patrons in Christopher North and Henry Glassford Bell, who helped him to obtain a publisher."
"The Retrospect appeared in 1825, and was lauded by the Quarterly Review and the Monthly Review, as well as by Scottish journals."
Some shorter poems which were published with it had the higher honour of being praised by Sir Walter Scott.
"Wright settled at Cambuslang, near Glasgow, where he married Margaret Chalmers, granddaughter of the parish schoolmaster, and worked as a weaver."
"Finding his means scanty he printed a second edition of the Retrospect two or three years later, and made a tour through Scotland selling copies."
"He found that his fame was extensive, and the discovery was his ruin."
"The hospitality he received encouraged habits of intemperance which, a few months after his return to Cambuslang, completely mastered him."
"He was separated from his wife, and lived in poverty and wretchedness."
In 1843 he made a determined effort to regulate his life.
His friends assisted him by publishing at Ayr The Whole Poetical Works of John Wright.
"Unfortunately, his reformation was either transient or too late, for he died in a Glasgow hospital a few months later."
He had a genuine poetic gift and an intense appreciation of natural beauty.
"His more ambitious pieces were marred by an artificial imitation of Lord Byron, but his shorter poems, reflecting the emotions of his own life, were happier."
"Works
1825 The Retrospect."
Canto II.
1830 Lines composed over Robert Fergusson's Grave.
1830 The Retrospect.

"Q:

Compute expectation using tower property

Imagine I want to compute $E[f(X,Y)]$ where $f$ is a suitable function and $X,Y$ random variables."
"If $X$ and $Y$ are correlated, let us say $X=g(Y)$ or even in my case $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are stochastic processes and $Y_t=g(X_{\cdot})$."
"My question is: am I allowed to do
$$E[f(X,Y)]= E[E[f(X,y)|y=Y]]?$$
in my case, now the law of $X$ is known and it is easy to compute $E[f(X,y)|y=Y]$ and then insert $y=Y$ and compute the rest."
"The point is, I know the law of $X$ if $Y$ is fixed given, and I fully know the law of $Y$, but I am not 100% sure that this method is correct, I feel I don't use the correlation part."
"The fact that they are (or not) correlated, does it affect the method of computing it?"
Thanks for the support!
"A:

Yes, it is correct."
"It follows from the tower property that
$$\mathbb{E}(f(X,Y))=\mathbb{E}\big( \mathbb{E}(f(X,Y) \mid \mathcal{F}) \big)$$
for any $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$."
"In particular, we can choose $\mathcal{F} := \sigma(Y)$ the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $Y$."
"Moreover, we know from the factorization lemma that there exists a function $h$ (depending on $f$) such that
$$\mathbb{E}(f(X,Y) \mid Y)  := \mathbb{E}(f(X,Y) \mid \sigma(Y)) = h(Y).$$
Usually, this is denoted by
$$h(y) = \mathbb{E}(f(X,Y) \mid Y=y).$$
Combining the equalities yields
$$\mathbb{E}(f(X,Y)) = \mathbb{E}\big( \mathbb{E}(f(X,Y) \mid Y=y) \big|_{y=Y} \big).$$"
If you have been following the saga of the non-working Hyper-V Server 2019 release from November.
You may be aware that the most prominent issue – that of Remote Desktop Services for Administration not working – has now been resolved in the February 2019 patch release cycle.
This article outlines how to create updated media for Hyper-V Server 2019 using the original installation medium and patch it into a working state.
"Note from the author

Please note that if you intend to use Hyper-V Server in a production environment, you should wait for Microsoft to re-issue the office ISO."
"Once it is released, it will be made available in the Microsoft Server Evaluation Centre."
Download following updates from the Microsoft Update CatalogueNote: This is correct as of early March 2019.
It is suggested that you apply newer cumulative and servicing updates as they are released in the future.
[Optional] If you wish to apply any language regionalisation (e.g.
"EN-GB), source the CAB file(s) for the language features that you require."
"For example:Microsoft-Windows-Server-LanguagePack-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~en-GB~10.0.17763.1.cab

Updating the Installation Image

To update the installation image:

Create a folder on C:\ called ‘Mount’

Add a second folder on C:\ called ‘hvs’

In the hvs folder, create a subfolder called ‘Updates’

Extract the entire contents of the ISO from the Hyper-V Server 2019 ISO into C:\hvs

Place the three MSU files from the Microsoft Update Catalogue into the C:\hvs\Updates folder

[Optionally] Place the CAB file for the language pack into the C:\hvs folder and for convenience rename it ‘lp.cab’

Open an elevated Command Prompt

Issue:cd /d ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\amd64""
To navigate into the working folder for the updated version of DISM.exe

Issue:dism.exe /mount-image /ImageFile:""C:\hvs\Sources\install.wim"" /Index:1 /MountDir:""C:\Mount""
To unpack the installation image into the C:\Mount folderNote: Do not navigate into this folder with CMD, PowerShell or Windows Explorer."
"If you leave a handle open against this folder when you try to re-pack the install.wim, it will fail."
"Once the mounting is complete, patch the installation by issuing:dism.exe /Image:""C:\Mount"" /Add-Package /PackagePath:""C:\hvs\Updates""

[Optional] Apply the language pack by issuing (change en-GB to your language as applicable):dism.exe /Image:""C:\Mount"" /ScratchDir:""C:\Windows\Temp"" /Add-Package /PackagePath:""C:\hvs\lp.cab""dism.exe /Image:""C:\Mount"" /Set-SKUIntlDefaults:en-GB
If you intend to use ImageX, DISM or WDS to deploy this image, you can skip the following command."
"If you intend to create a new bootable ISO or UFD, issue:dism.exe /image:""C:\Mount"" /gen-langini /distribution:""C:\hvs""
This will create a new Lang.ini file which must be included in the ISO/UFD media (but is not required for other deployment methods)

Once DISM has processed the installation image, the new Install.wim file can be found at:
C:\hvs\Sources\install.wim

At this point you will have a working installation image which you can use to create a new ISO, UFD or install via WDS."
You should delete the Updates folder and [optional] lp.cab from C:\hvs before creating a new ISO or bootable UFD.
"If it goes wrong at any point, issue the following command to abort the process and go back and try again:dism.exe /unmount-image /MountDir:""C:\Mount"" /Discard

Delete the C:\Mount and C:\hvs folders once you have finished creating you new deployment media."
"Final Word

If you follow the above, you will have not only a fixed RDP experience, but also a current patched version of Hyper-V Server."
Eliminating a little time spent waiting for Windows Update to run.
If you are going to enable RDP for Administration.
"As ever, do not forget to enable the firewall rule in PowerShell."
SConfig.cmd does not do this for you!
Elections BC is urging anyone in the province who has yet to cast their ballot in the proportional representation referendum to do so soon — and in person.
"The deadline for Elections BC to receive the ballots is Friday, Dec. 7 at 4:30 p.m. PT — which means it's now too late to pop them in the mail, according to spokesperson Rebecca Penz."
"The deadline to vote was originally set for Nov. 30, but it was extended by a week because of rotating strikes at Canada Post."
The federal government has since passed legislation to force an end to the strikes.
"""We understand that the mail is now moving smoothly through Canada Post, but we're still encouraging people to return [ballots] in person,"" Penz​ said."
Voters can drop off their ballots at a Service BC or Referendum Service Office.
Locations can be found on the Elections BC website.
Penz​ said 39 per cent of the ballots have been returned so far.
Elections BC is hoping to have results available before Christmas.
"""It does depend on voter turnout and how long it takes for us to screen each of the packages,"" she said."
British Columbians are voting on whether to keep the province's first-past-the-post electoral system or switch to one of three different types of proportional representation:

The identification of overrepresented motifs in a collection of biological sequences continues to be a relevant and challenging problem in computational biology.
Currently popular methods of motif discovery are based on statistical learning theory.
"In this paper, a machine-learning approach to the motif discovery problem is explored."
The approach is based on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) where the output layer neuron weight vectors are replaced by position weight matrices.
"This approach can be used to characterise features present in a set of sequences, and thus can be used as an aid in overrepresented motif discovery."
"The SOM approach to motif discovery is demonstrated using biological sequence datasets, both real and simulated"
"Kawaramachi Street

runs parallel to the west bank of the Kamo River on the eastern side of Kyoto, Japan."
Its intersection with Shijō Street is called Shijō Kawaramachi and is a leading shopping district of the city.
Both Shijō and Kawaramachi Street are protected with smoking bans.
"Overview

Edo Period 
Located outside of Heian-kyō and runs almost parallel to Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Odoi."
It is thought that it was established when the city expanded to the Kamo River in the early Edo Period.
From north to south it extends from Aoibashi Nishizume to Jujō Street.
North of Aoibashi Nishizume its name changes to Shimogamo Main Street.
South of Jujō Street it curves along the Kamo River and joins together with Kuzebashi Street.
The stretch between Sanjō Street and Shijō Street is one of Kyoto's downtown shopping streets.
Because the portion between Shijō Street and Kamijuzuyacho Street runs parallel to the Kamo River bending  in a North-North-East and South-South-West direction it naturally intersects with North-South running Teramachi Street and Gokomachi Street.
"History 
Category:Streets in Kyoto

It is not clear when the excavation began of the eastern end of Heikan-kyo and inner eastern side of Odoi but because Odoi was runs along Kawaramachi Street's western side it is thought to be after the creation of Kawaramachi."

"Search and Seizure

p>With the support of state law enforcement, a Massachusetts Democratic state representative has filed a drug war bill that would send violators to prison for a mandatory minimum two years (five years for a second offense) and allow police to seize their vehicles -- all without the presence of any actual drugs."
"Sponsored by Rep. Stephan Hay (D-Fitchfield), the measure, House Bill 1266, makes it a crime to have a hidden compartment in one's vehicle or to try to add one -- and it presumes that any hidden compartment in a vehicle is for ""for the purpose of transporting or distributing controlled substances"" and related contraband, such as cash or weapons."
"As the bill specifies in its asset forfeiture section:

Proof that a conveyance contains a hidden compartment as defined in this section shall be prima facie evidence that the conveyance was used intended for use in and for the business of unlawfully manufacturing, dispensing, or distributing controlled substances."
This is a legislative attempt to redefine reality in the name of drug war priorities akin to South Dakota's law deeming meth use or possession by a parent as child abuse.
"Despite that law, meth use is not child abuse, although it could lead to it."
"Similarly, having a hidden compartment in a car does not mean one is involved in trafficking, although one could be."
"But in both cases, legislators seek to twist reality to sync with prohibitionist -- and punitive -- ideology."
"Only one state, Ohio, has a similar law on the books, and it has only been used once, but that one instance should be disturbing."
"In 2013, state troopers stopped Norman Gurley and discovered a secret compartment in his vehicle."
They found absolutely no drugs but arrested him anyway on charges he broke the secret compartment law.
"That case briefly became a national news sensation before fading into obscurity, but it still lives: Gurley is set for a jury trial in December."
"Police in Massachusetts are supporting this bill not only because it gives them one more tool in their war on drugs, but also because they get to keep any cars they seize."
"Massachusetts has the worst civil asset forfeiture laws in the country, and unlike states that are lining up to end forfeitures without a criminal conviction, as neighboring Connecticut did this week, cops only need to reach the threshold of probable cause that someone's cash or car or other property is related to a crime to seize it."
"This bill would make it all the easier, and they wouldn't even need to find any drugs."
"The state of South Dakota is practicing a form of drug war excess tantamount to torture, according to a pair of federal lawsuits filed by the ACLU on June 28."
One suit charges that law enforcement and medical personnel subject drug suspects to forcible catheterization if they refuse to submit to a drug test.
"Welcome to the Forced Catheterization State

The second suit charges even more outrageous conduct: State social workers and medical personnel subjecting a screaming toddler to the same treatment."
Let's be clear here: We are talking about a person having a plastic tube painfully inserted in his penis without his consent and with the use of whatever physical force is necessary by agents of the state.
In the name of enforcing drug laws.
"Law enforcement has an incentive to coerce people into consenting to warrantless drug tests -- with the realistic threat of forced catheterization -- because its state laws punish not just possession of drugs, but having used them."
"Under the state's ""internal possession"" or ""unlawful ingestion"" statutes, testing positive for illicit drugs is a criminal offense."
"""Forcible catheterization is painful, physically and emotionally damaging, and deeply degrading,"" said ACLU of South Dakota executive director Heather Smith in a statement announcing the filings."
"""Catheterization isn't the best way to obtain evidence, but it is absolutely the most humiliating."
The authorities ordered the catheterization of our clients to satisfy their own sadistic and authoritarian desires to punish.
"Subjecting anyone to forcible catheterization, especially a toddler, to collect evidence when there are less intrusive means available, is unconscionable."""
"In the case of the toddler, the ACLU is suing on behalf of Kirsten Hunter of Pierre and her thee-year-old son."
"According to the complaint, their ordeal began on February 23, when police arrived to arrest her live-in boyfriend for failing a probationary drug test."
"Accompanying the cops was Department of Social Services (DSS) caseworker Matt Opbroeck, who informed Hunter that she and her children would have to take drug tests, and that if she failed to agree, her two kids would be seized on the spot."
"Under such coercion, Hunter agreed to take herself and her kids to St. Mary's Avera Hospital to be tested the next day."
"Here, in the dry language of the legal filing, is what happened next:

Ms. Hunter was met by [SMA medical staff] and told that she and her children needed to urinate in cups on orders of DSS."
"At the time, A.Q., was not toilet-trained and could not produce a sample in a cup."
"Even though other methods, such as placing a bag over his penis, would have yielded a urine sample, [SMA medical staff] immediately began to hold him down and to catheterize him."
"At the time, [they] did not inform Ms. Hunter of altemative methods of getting a urine sample or explain the risks associated with catheterizing a child."
Ms. Hunter did not know that she could object nor was she given any opportunity to object.
Ms. Hunter did not speak with or see a doctor.
A.Q.
was catheterized and screamed during the entire procedure.
"On information and belief, A.Q."
was catheterized with an adult-sized catheter.
Ms. Hunter was humiliated and upset about A.Q.
's catheterization.
A.Q.
was injured physically and emotionally.
"In the aftermath of the state-sanctioned assault, three days later, A.Q."
"had to be taken to a hospital emergency room 100 miles away in Huron for constipation and pain and discomfort in his penis, and he had to return again to ASM two days after that, where he was diagnosed with a staph infection in his penis."
The ACLU argues that forcible catheterization of A.Q.
"violates the Fourth Amendment's proscription against warrantless searches, the Fifth Amendment's right not to be forced to testify against oneself, and the 14th Amendment's due process clause because ""it shocks the conscience, it was not medically necessary, and it was not reviewed by a judge."""
The lawsuit seeks monetary relief as well as declaration that the procedure is unconstitutional.
"""The Fourth Amendment guarantees people the right to be free from unreasonable government searches,"" said Courtney Bowie, ACLU of South Dakota Legal Director."
"""There is nothing reasonable about forcibly catheterizing a child."
"The Constitution's purpose is to protect people from government intrusions exactly like this."""
"There is nothing reasonable about forcibly catheterizing drug defendants, either -- especially when the only drug use suspected is of marijuana -- but the second lawsuit filed by the ACLU alleges the practice is widespread among law enforcement agencies in the state, including repeated allegations of forced catheterizations after the victims have agreed to provide urine samples, the sole reason being that police involved could ""gratify their sadistic desires,"" the complaint says."
"""State agents, including law enforcement officers, in multiple cities and counties in South Dakota have conspired to attempt to rationalize, justify, and illegally forcibly catheterize drug suspects, and illegally coerce drug suspects to provide urine samples by threatening them with illegal forcible catheterization if they will not voluntarily provide a urine sample,"" the complaint says."
"The conspiracy violates the civil rights not only of those subjected to forced catheterization, but those threatened with, the ACLU argues."
"The lawsuit has five plaintiffs, all of whom were subjected to the procedure, and lists 20 unnamed police officers from Pierre, Sisseton, and the Highway Patrol, as well as one named Pierre officer, and the cities of Pierre and Sisseton."
"The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief to stop the practice, as well as ""compensatory and punitive damages."""
"The ACLU sues South Dakota over the forced drug testing of a toddler, Detroit residents again sue the dope squad for killing dogs in pot raids, Pennsylvania's governor signs an asset forfeiture reform bill, and more."
EPA Rejects California's Request to Recognize Allowable Marijuana Pesticides.
Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt last week rejected the state's request to recognize acceptable pesticides for pot crops.

"The EPA finds that the general illegality of cannabis cultivation makes pesticide use on cannabis a fundamentally different use pattern."""

South Dakota Sued Over Forced Catherization of 3-Year-Old for Drug Test."
The ACLU of South Dakota has filed a pair of lawsuits over the forced use of a catheter to take a urine sample from a three-year-boy to test for drugs as part of a child welfare investigation.
The suit comes in the case of a Pierre woman whose boyfriend violated probation by testing positive for illegal drugs.
Child protective workers then told the women her children would be taken away if she did not submit them to a drug test.
The federal lawsuit names as defendants the state of South Dakota and the hospital whose employees actually performed the procedure.
"Law Enforcement

Detroit's Dog Killing Drug Cops Sued for Third Time."
A Detroit couple has filed a civil rights lawsuit against Detroit Police alleging officers needlessly and maliciously killed their three dogs during a July 2016 marijuana raid after officers refused to let them retrieve the animals from the back yard.
That brings to three the number of active lawsuits filed against Detroit cops for killing dogs during pot raids.
"The culprit is the department's Major Violators Unit, which conducts hundreds of raids a year in the city, and which has left a trail of dead dogs in its wake."
One officer alone has killed 69 dogs.
Illinois Supreme Court Rules County DAs Can't Form Their Own Dope Squads.
"The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday the county prosecutors cannot form their own policing units to conduct drug interdiction efforts, including traffic stops."
The ruling came in a case involving the State Attorney's Felony Enforcement (SAFE) Unit created by the LaSalle County district attorney.
"The unit operated for five years, mainly stopping cars on their way to and from Chicago."
"Previously, state appeals courts had ruled that the units were an overreach of prosecutorial authority, and now the state's highest court has backed them up."
"In states where marijuana has been legalized, traffic stops resulting in searches by state police are down dramatically, according to a new analysis from the Marshall Project and the Center for Investigative Reporting."
"With marijuana possession being legal, police in legal states can no longer assume criminal activity merely because of the presence of pot, which would have given them probable cause to conduct a search."
"And that means fewer interactions between drivers and police, reducing the prospect of dangerous -- or even deadly -- clashes."
"But even though the number of searches dropped for all racial groups, black and brown drivers are still being subjected to searches at a higher rate than whites, the study found."
"And because the report only studied state police (Highway Patrol) stops, not stops by local law enforcement, which patrols urban areas with higher minority population concentrations, it may understate the racial disparity in traffic stop searches."
"The report is based on an analysis of data from researchers at Stanford University, who released a report this week studying some 60 million state patrol stops in 31 states between 2011 and 2015, the most thorough look yet at national traffic stop data."
The results from the legal pot states of Colorado and Washington are striking.
"In Colorado, the number of traffic stop searches dropped by nearly two-thirds for whites, 58% for Hispanics, and nearly half for blacks."
"In Washington, the search rate dropped by about 25% for whites and Hispanics, and 34% for African-Americans."
"Still, racial disparities in search rates persisted in both states."
"In Colorado, the search rate for black drivers was 3.3 times that for whites, and the rate for Hispanic drivers was 2.7 times that for whites."
"In Washington, blacks were twice as likely to be searched as whites, while the search rate for Hispanics was 1.7 times that of whites."
The traffic stop search data parallels what happened with marijuana arrests in legal states.
"In Colorado, for instance, a 2016 Department of Public Safety report found that while the number of pot arrests dropped by nearly half after legalization, the arrest rate for blacks was still nearly three times that of whites."
"""Legalizing marijuana is not going to solve racial disparities,"" said Mark Silverstein, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado."
"""We need to do a lot more before we get at that."""
"But legalizing marijuana does reduce the number of traffic stop searches, and given the fraught relationship between police and the citizenry, especially communities of color, that is a good thing in itself."
"In a prime illustration of the perversities of the war on drugs, US Customs has seized a shipment of a thousand lock boxes aimed at allowing marijuana, tobacco, and pharmaceutical users to keep their stashes safe from kids."
"Customs has officially designated the boxes as drug paraphernalia, even though everyone involved concedes the boxes are aimed at preventing drug use by kids."
"The stash cases were designed by and destined for Stashlogix, a Boulder, Colorado, firm established in the wake of marijuana legalization in the state in 2012 to address a mini-panic over news reports about the dangers of marijuana for kids."
"Those reports were generally overstated, but the need for secure stashes for pot and other potentially dangerous goodies remained."
"""People didn't have ways to safely store these items out of reach of kids, other than up on shelves or in sock drawers,"" Stashlogix cofounder Skip Stone told the Washington Post."
"So he and a partner founded the company to market cases and containers ""for the storage and transport of medicine, tobacco, and other stuff."""
"The company's small, lockable cases, with tiny jars and odor-neutralizing inserts included, were a hit with customers."
"""People love the product,"" Stone said."
"""They use it for all sorts of things, but cannabis is definitely one of them."
"They keep it locked, they feel safer, they feel more responsible."""
"So the company geared up production, placing orders with a Chinese factory, but things came to a crashing halt on April 28, when Customs seized 1,000 of the storage cases."
"""This is to officially notify you that Customs and Border Protection seized the property described below at Los Angeles International Airport on April 28, 2017,"" read a letter received by Stashlogix."
"The agency had seized the bags, valued at $12,000, because ""it is unlawful for any person to import drug paraphernalia."""
"Stashlogix's childproof pot lock box

When challenged by Stashlogix, Customs conceded that ""standing alone, the Stashlogix storage case can be viewed as a multi-purpose storage case with no association with or to controlled substances,"" but it pointed out that the odor-absorbing carbon inset could be used to hide the smell of weed, and it cited favorable reviews of the product in the marijuana press, concluding ""that there exists one consistent and primary use for the Stashlogix storage cases; namely, the storage and concealment of marijuana."""
"The federal government doesn't officially recognize the legality of medical or recreational marijuana, and Customs is following decades-old drug war paraphernalia laws to achieve a perverse result: Making marijuana potentially riskier in places where it is legal."
"After all, half of current pot smokers are parents, and this application of federal policy is making it more difficult for them to keep their kids out of their stashes."
"Stone is appealing the ruling, but in the meantime, he's had to write off an additional $18,000 worth of goods still outside the country and lay off his three employees."
"He's looking for a domestic manufacturer for his cases, since Customs can't mess with domestic goods and the DEA hasn't made paraphernalia a high priority, but the ultimate solution lies in Washington."
"""It's going to take an act of Congress to clear up some of these contradictions between state and federal law,"" he told the Post."
"""These paraphernalia laws are outdated."
"Keeping kids safe should be more important than outdated regulations."""

"The report examined a hundred asset forfeiture cases, and found that fewer than half advanced ongoing investigations."

Illinois Lawmakers File Legalization Bill.
"A group of Chicago Democratic legislators have filed a marijuana legalization bill by amending an existing bill, House Bill 2353."
"The measure would legalize the possession of up to an ounce by adults (a half-ounce for non-residents), set up a system of legal marijuana manufacture and distribution $50 per 28 grams on all cannabis flowers, and give state regulators 180 days to get a system up and running."

Supreme Court Rules Lawsuit From Man Jailed Over Bottle of Vitamins Can Advance."
"An Illinois man jailed for two months after police claimed the pills in his vitamin bottle were ecstasy despite lab tests that showed they weren't can continue to pursue his federal civil rights claim, the US Supreme Court ruled Tuesday."
"Elijah Manuel, who is black, said officers pulled over the vehicle in which he was riding, falsely claimed they smelled marijuana, screamed racial slurs, then claimed their field drug test indicated his vitamins were ecstasy."
Police continued to hold him in jail even after other tests verified the pills were not ecstasy until prosecutors eventually dropped the case.
"""No evidence of Manuel's criminality had come to light in between the roadside arrest and the county court proceeding initiating legal process; to the contrary, yet another test of Manuel's pills had come back negative in that period,"" according to the opinion."
"""All that the judge had before him were police fabrications about the pills' content."
The judge's order holding Manuel for trial therefore lacked any proper basis.
"And that means Manuel's ensuing pretrial detention, no less than his original arrest, violated his Fourth Amendment rights."""

Colorado Supreme Court Says Cops Don't Have to Give Seized Marijuana Back."
"The state Supreme Court ruled Monday that police cannot be forced to return marijuana to a defendant acquitted of pot crimes, because that would cause them to violate the federal Controlled Substances Act."
"""The return provision requires law enforcement officers to return, or distribute, marijuana,"" the decision says."
"""Thus compliance with the return provision necessarily requires law enforcement officer to violate federal law."""
"Three justices disagreed, however, saying that the CSA ""immunizes federal and state officers from civil and criminal liability in the circumstances at issue here."""
But they lost.
Texas Judge Recommends No Punishment for Teacher Who Smoked Pot in Colorado.
"A teacher who admitted legally consuming marijuana while in Texas should not face any legal or professional penalty, an administrative judge has ruled."

Colombia Coca, Opium, and Marijuana Farmers to Form Association."
"The growers are planning to found the National Coordinator of Coca, Marijuana, and Opium Growers to try ""to forge a common negotiating front with the government to influence any potential agreements on drug control that come as a result of peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)."
The organization would have national reach and appears to be an effort to create a political coalition with the aim of directly negotiating with the government.
"Notably, such a coalition could form a future political support base for an eventual FARC political party."
"By linking the future of a FARC party to the issue of forceful eradication, which the group would almost assuredly oppose, the pace of eradication in Colombia could end up slowing even further,"" Stratfor reported."
The decision -- and the technology -- has implications that go far beyond the shadowy world of drug dealers and DEA agents.
"Stingray is a generic term for a cell-site simulator, a device that can mimic cell towers as a means of tracking down cell phones."
"Law enforcement can use Stingray to pick up phone calls, voicemail messages, and text messages, and to pinpoint the physical location of a targeted phone to within a few feet."
"In the Lambis case, federal prosecutors argued that they didn't need a warrant to use the wide-ranging Stingray, but federal district court Judge William H. Pauley shot them down."
"""Absent a search warrant,"" Judge Pauley held in his 14-page opinion, ""the government may not turn a citizen's cell phone into a tracking device."""
But that's exactly what DEA agents did to build their case against Lambis.
"They used Stingray to locate his cell phone inside his family residence, then conducted a warrantless search of his bedroom and uncovered a large amount of cocaine."
"Federal prosecutors had a fallback argument -- that even if a warrant were necessary to track Lambis' phone, once his father gave agents at his door permission to enter and Lambis then ""consented"" to a search, the search should be allowed -- but Pauley wasn't having that, either."
"""The procurement of a 'voluntary' consent to search based upon a prior illegal search taints that consent,"" he held."
"US District Court Judge William H. Pauley

But if federal prosecutors have their way, the DEA and other federal agents will be able to do it again."
"In September, prosecutors from the US Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York filed an appeal of Pauley's decision with the US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals."
So is the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
"Rebecca Jeschke, a digital rights analyst for the group, told the Chronicle that if the government wins on appeal, everyone's privacy will be eroded."
"""As we use cell phones more and more, a successful appeal will touch nearly every American,"" she said."
A successful appeal would be salt in the wounds of legal scholars and privacy advocates who hailed Pauley's forceful decision in Lambis as a major victory against warrantless surveillance by the government.
"""This is the first federal ruling I know of where a judge squarely ruled that the Fourth Amendment required police to get a warrant to use a Stingray, and further, suppressed evidence derived from warrantless use of the technology,"" ACLU Attorney Nathan Wessler told the New York Times at the time."
"""After decades of secret and warrantless use of Stingray technology by law enforcement to track phones, a federal judge has finally held authorities to account."""
"According to an ACLU report, at least 60 state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies in 23 states have used Stingray to suck up citizens' cell phone data."
"Stingray in the Lambis Case

According to court documents, the trail to Raymond Lambis' front door began with a DEA investigation into an alleged drug pipeline importing large amounts of cocaine from South America beginning in early 2015."
DEA agents obtained a wiretap warrant to glean information about the numbers dialed from a specific cell phone.
"After agents obtained the warrant, they monitored messages off a Blackberry between two suspected drug traffickers."
"During one particular conversation agents overheard a voice referring to someone named ""Patilla,"" whose phone had a 646 area code."
"Messages between Patilla and the other, unnamed party indicated that Patilla could supply hydrochloric acid, which is used by traffickers in the heroin-refining process."
"DEA agents then got a warrant to order the phone company to provide ""approximate location,"" or ""cell-site location information"" (CSLI)."
"A frequent complaint of defense attorneys and privacy advocates has been that law enforcement, and DEA agents in particular, will mislead judges into thinking the warrant they sign off on is to get specific cell-site information from a carrier when what agents are really doing is using Stingray to locate a person's phone or actual address."
"As the Chronicle reported in 2013, ""The Stingray technology not only raises Fourth Amendment concerns, it also raise questions about whether police withhold information from judges to monitorcitizens without probable cause.That's what happened in Lambis."
"In the Lambis case, DEA Special Agent Kathryn Glover obtained a warrant seeking cell-site data and location information for that 646 phone, but did not tell the judge DEA would be using Stingray to conduct a search to pin down Lambis' exact location."
"""So they went to the effort to get a warrant, but then didn't tell the judge they intended to use that same warrant to use a Stingray,"" ACLU technology specialist Christopher Soghoian told Ars Technica."
"""It is so important for federal courts to recognize that use of a Stingray is a search of a Fourth Amendment-protected place, and not only is a warrant required, but the court authorizing the surveillance must be told they are authorizing the use of a Stingray."""
"But the phone carrier's CSLI data, which Agent Glover said in her warrant application would be used to track down the 646 phone, only guided DEA agents to the ""general area"" of Broadway and 177th Street in Manhattan."
To pinpoint the 'house or building where the phone most likely resided with its owner the DEA unleashed Stingray to first zero in on the exact building and then on the exact apartment.
A DEA technician using a hand-held Stingray walked through the building until he picked up the strongest signal -- coming from inside the Lambis apartment.
"Then, DEA agents knocked on the door, and Lambis' father allowed the gun-toting agents inside."
"When agents asked if anyone else lived there, the elderly man knocked on his son's door, and Lambis opened it up only to be confronted by the DEA."
"Faced by the agents in his home, he then consented to a search of his bedroom, where agents discovered a kilo of cocaine, empty ziplock bags, a scale, and eight cell phones."
He was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and other drug-related charges.
It was Lambis' defense motion to throw out that evidence as a result of an unlawful search that led to Pauley's ruling.
"The States Aren't Waiting for the Federal Courts

The courts aren't the only place Stingray is running into headwinds."
"Thanks to decisions like that in the Lambis case, some states have begun passing privacy legislation aiming at protecting citizens' cell phone data from warrantless searches by Stingray or similar cell-site simulators used by police."
"Among them are California, Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington."
"""Citizens have the right to expect that they will not have their personal information investigated by police without a warrant,"" said Rep. Edith H Ajello (D-Providence) after passage of a 2016 Rhode Island bill that prohibits obtaining cell phone data by cell-site technology."
"""Requiring a warrant won't make it difficult for police to do their job,"" concurred Sen. Donna Nesselbush (D-North Providence)."
"""It's essentially updating search warrant law for the information age."""
"""As advances in technology enable police to more efficiently investigate and solve crimes, it's important that we help them to know they are following state laws and the Constitution,"" said Illinois Sen. Daniel Bliss (D-Evanston) upon passage of similar legislation there in 2016."
"That law, the Citizen Privacy Protection Act, went into effect January 1."
"While the states aren't waiting for the federal courts to provide protections, the Lambis decision and related controversies over Stingray technology have created such a firestorm that the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security are now requiring agents to obtain a warrant before using Stingray in investigations."
But that could change if the appeals court rules in the government's favor.
Stay tuned.

"var foos = AllFoos().Where (x => matches (x));
return foos.OrderBy (x => pos.Dist (x.Center)).FirstOrDefault ();

The important point to notice here is that every operation, including OrderBy, is subject to deferred execution, so the performance should be ok."

Edit: I found this question to be a valuable source in this issue."
"Since OrderBy actually orders the whole list first, it's of course slow (as Eric said, O(n log n)."
A better solution would be to use Aggregate or Jon Skeet's propsed MinBy extension (see above link for examples).

Hunting behavior of wild chimpanzees in the Taï National Park.
"Hunting is often considered one of the major behaviors that shaped early hominids' evolution, along with the shift toward a drier and more open habitat."
We suggest that a precise comparison of the hunting behavior of a species closely related to man might help us understand which aspects of hunting could be affected by environmental conditions.
"The hunting behavior of wild chimpanzees is discussed, and new observations on a population living in the tropical rain forest of the Taï National Park, Ivory Coast, are presented."
Some of the forest chimpanzees' hunting performances are similar to those of savanna-woodlands populations; others are different.
"Forest chimpanzees have a more specialized prey image, intentionally search for more adult prey, and hunt in larger groups and with a more elaborate cooperative level than savanna-woodlands chimpanzees."
"In addition, forest chimpanzees tend to share meat more actively and more frequently."
These findings are related to some theories on aspects of hunting behavior in early hominids and discussed in order to understand some factors influencing the hunting behavior of wild chimpanzees.
"Finally, the hunting behavior of primates is compared with that of social carnivores."
Effect of substituents on complex stability aimed at designing new iron(III) and aluminum(III) chelators.
"The solution equilibria of iron(III) and aluminum(III) with two classes of hard ligands (catechol, salicylic acid and their nitro-derivatives) have been reliably studied by potentiometric, spectrophotometric and NMR spectroscopy."
The effect of the nitro substituent on the binding properties of catechol and salicylic acid has been examined thoroughly.
"The inductive and resonance properties of the substituent that, as expected, lower the basicity of the phenolic and carboxylic groups, lead to a general decrease in both protonation and complex formation constants."
"This decrease causes an increase in pM of between 0.2 and 1.1pM units for the nitro-substituted salicylates and of about 4 units for 4-nitrocatechol, with a significantly higher chelating efficacy."
The influence of the substituent on catechol and salicylic acid is discussed in detail on the basis of conditional constants at pH 7.4.

Omega-3 fatty acid concentrate from Dunaliella salina possesses anti-inflammatory properties including blockade of NF-κB nuclear translocation.
"The health benefits of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6), have been long known."
"Although various studies have demonstrated the health benefits of ω-3 PUFA, the mechanisms of action of ω-3 PUFAs are still not completely understood."
"While the major commercial source is marine fish oil, in this study we suggest the marine micro algae, Dunaliella salina as an alternate source of omega-3 fatty acids."
Treatment with this algal omega-3 fatty acid concentrate (Ds-ω-3 FA) resulted in significant down-regulation of LPS-induced production of TNF-α and IL-6 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
The concentrate was also found to be a potent blocker of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) expression.
The present study reveals the anti-inflammatory properties of Ds-ω-3 FA concentrate including the inhibition of NF-κB translocation.
"Q:

Conditions in LINQ expression C#

I'm a beginner with LINQ."
"I'm trying to create a CSV file using a LINQ Expression I found on Stack Overflow : 
var sb = new StringBuilder();

var headers = dgvDonnees.Columns.Cast<DataGridViewColumn>();
sb.AppendLine(string.Join("","", headers.Select(column => ""\"""" + column.HeaderText + ""\"""").ToArray()));

foreach (DataGridViewRow row in dgvDonnees.Rows)
{
    var cells = row.Cells.Cast<DataGridViewCell>();
    sb.AppendLine(string.Join("","", cells.Select(cell => ""\"""" + cell.Value + ""\"""").ToArray()));
}

I want to add this simple condition to the foreach loop : (I use this condition in a for loop)
if (Convert.ToInt32(dgvDonnees.Rows[i].Cells[10].Value) == 0) continue;

I want the lines whose 10th cell is not zero is present in the final CSV."
How can I do this?
Thank you.
"A:

If you actually want a LINQ solution, as your question implies, you will want to do this:
foreach (DataGridViewRow row in dgvDonnees.Rows
    .Where(r => Convert.ToInt32(r.Cells[10].Value) != 0))
{
    var cells = row.Cells.Cast<DataGridViewCell>();
    sb.AppendLine(string.Join("","", cells.Select(cell => ""\"""" + cell.Value + ""\"""").ToArray()));
}

In other words, let LINQ do the filtering for you instead of adding extra statements to the loop body."
"It's more concise, and more correctly reflects the semantics you are looking for (i.e."
"the code looks a lot more like your specification ""I want the lines whose 10th cell is not zero"", whereas using continue in the loop requires an inverted logic expression from what the specification actually is)."
"A:

Just put at the beginning of your foreach loop this line :
if (Convert.ToInt32(row.Cells[10].Value) == 0) continue;

row replace your dgDonnees.Rows[i]
Finally you will have this code:
foreach (DataGridViewRow row in dgvDonnees.Rows)
{
    if (Convert.ToInt32(row.Cells[10].Value) == 0) continue;

    var cells = row.Cells.Cast<DataGridViewCell>();
    sb.AppendLine(string.Join("","", cells.Select(cell => ""\"""" + cell.Value + ""\"""").ToArray()));

Psychopathology of frontal lobe syndromes.
"In this review, some basic aspects of frontal lobe functioning have been discussed and methods of testing for frontal lobe abnormalities outlined."
"It has been emphasized that the frontal lobes are affected in a number of diseases, which cover a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric problems."
"Furthermore, it is suggested that the frontal lobes are involved in syndromes not traditionally thought to be related to frontal lobe dysfunction, for example, schizophrenia, and rarer presentations such as misidentification syndromes."
"Frontal lobe dysfunction often goes unrecognized, especially in patients who have normal neurologic testing and apparently intact IQ when routine methods of investigation are employed."
"Although marked disturbances of behavior following frontal lobe dysfunction have now been described for well over 120 years, these large areas of the human brain, and their links with some of the highest attributes of mankind, have been relatively neglected and are worthy of much further exploration by those interested in neuropsychiatric problems."

[Clinical study of UFT chemotherapy in renal cancer.
Kyushu University Cooperative Study Group of Renal Cancer].
Clinical effects of UFT chemotherapy for renal cancer were evaluated by 19 collaborating hospitals.
UFT (300-600 mg/day) was administered for more than 3 months.
"Of the 30 patients entered in this study, 21 were evaluable for the antitumor effects of the drug."
"Of the 21 evaluable patients, complete response (CR) was obtained in 2 patients, partial response (PR) in 1, no change (NC) in 7, progressive disease (PD) in 11, respectively."
The response rate was 0% in patients with primary lesion and 21.4% in nephrectomized patients with metastatic lesion.
"Responses were observed in the metastases of lung, pleura and mediastinal lymph node."
The main side effects in 27 patients were gastrointestinal symptoms.
No significant abnormality was noted on blood laboratory data.
In one patient the drug was discontinued within 3 months because of gastrointestinal symptoms.
These results suggested that UFT chemotherapy for advanced renal cancer was clinically effective.

"Field of the Invention
This invention relates to apparatus for grinding twist drills each having two clearance surfaces and a helical flute associated with each clearance surface, which apparatus comprises a rotatable drive shaft, a grinding wheel having a grinding surface and axially movably mounted on and coupled to said drive shaft and spring biased toward a drill-guiding structure, which faces said grinding surface and has guiding passages differing in diameter and adapted to guide respective ones of said twist drills differing in diameter toward said grinding surface until the latter engages such twist drill at one clearance surface thereof, also comprising in alignment with each of said guiding passages at least one guide projection for extending into a flute of a twist drill extending through said guiding passage, and drill stop means for engaging a twist drill extending through said guiding passage at the other clearance surface thereof so as to limit the advance of said twist drill toward the resiliently yielding grinding surface."
2.
"Description of the Prior Art
Such apparatus in which twist drills can be ground without being chucked are known from U.S. Pat."
No.
"3,753,320 and Published German Application No."
16 52 239.
In such known apparatus an adjustable abutment acting between a member rigidly connected to the mounting for the grinding wheel and the drill-guiding structure is arranged to limit the spring-urged movement of the grinding surface toward the drill-guiding structure in an end position in which said grinding surface is closer to the guide projections than the drill stop means.
"For a satisfactory result of the grinding operation, a proper position of the clearance surface at which the drill is being ground relative to the grinding surface is of crucial significance."
"That position will depend on the radial position of the guide projection relative to the guiding passage and, owing to the helical flutes of the twist drill, on the distance from the guide projection to the drill stop means."
That distance must be short because otherwise the fact that the flutes of twist drills from different manufacturers have different helix angles will result in an excessive deviation from the proper position of the clearance surface of some of such twist drills relative to the grinding surface.
One disadvantage of said known apparatus resides in that the axial distance from the grinding surface to the guide projections increases with the wear of said grinding surface and eventually the drills may no longer contact the grinding wheel at all.
The proper distance must then be reestablished by means of the adjustable abutment means.
"Owing to the short axial distance between the guide projections and the drill stop means, a wrong adjustment of said drill abutment means may have the result that the grinding wheel grinds on the drill-guiding structure and damages the guide projections."
Another disadvantage of such known apparatus will arise during a prolonged grinding of twist drills which are so small in diameter that they will not contact the entire grinding surface during each revolution of the grinding wheel and resides in that a groove will then be formed in the grinding surface.
"When a twist drill larger in a diameter is subsequently ground, that groove will be reflected by the clearance surface that has been ground, i.e."
"by the cutting edge of such larger drill, and the grinding wheel cannot be used any longer when such groove has reached a certain size."
Bradykinin-related peptides in the venom of the solitary wasp Cyphononyx fulvognathus.
"Bradykinin (BK) and its related peptides are widely distributed in venomous animals, including wasps."
"In fact, we have previously purified a novel BK-related peptide (BRP) named Cd-146 and the threonine(6)-bradykinin (Thr(6)-BK) from the venom of the solitary wasp Cyphononyx fulvognathus."
"Further survey of this same wasp venom extract allowed the structural characterization of two other novel BRPs, named here as fulvonin and cyphokinin."
"Biochemical characterization performed here showed that although the high primary structure similarity observed with BK, these wasp peptides are not good substrates for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) acting more likely as inhibitors of this enzyme."
"In pharmacological assays, only those more structurally similar to BK, namely cyphokinin and Thr(6)-BK, were able to promote the contraction of guinea-pig ileum smooth muscle preparations, which was completely blocked by the B(2) receptors antagonist HOE-140 in the same way as observed for BK."
Only fulvonin was shown to potentiate BK-elicited smooth muscle contraction.
"Moreover, the 2 new wasp BRPs, namely fulvonin and cyphokinin, as well as Cd-146 and Thr(6)-BK, showed hyperalgesic effect in the rat paw pressure test after intraplantar injection."
"This effect was shown here to be due to the action of these peptides on BK receptors, since the hyperalgesia induced by both Cd-146 and fulvonin was blocked by B(1) receptor antagonist, while the effect of both cyphokinin and Thr(6)-BK was reversed by B(2) antagonist."
This data give support to a better understanding of the function and targets of the kinin-related peptides widely found in several insect venoms.
"Q:

"I haven't been able to find a conclusive answer for this question, so I thought I'd ask it myself...
My Win7 PC has been running all but bad the past year or so I've owned it until today."
"I was trying to install a few dependencies for atom.io, when my PC froze."
I rebooted the computer to find an unexpected chkdsk scan.

Deleting corrupt attribute record (128, """") from file segment xxxxxx
Deleting index entry xxxxxx in index $I30 of file yyyyyy

A few other things came up as well, but I was not able to capture them."
"I believe the gist was something about ""orphaned files"", and something about free space being marked as allocated in the volume bitmap."
"I'm genuinely worried currently, as this has never happened before."
"In the research I've found, I've seen two sides: one being ""It's fine, just let it sit"", and the other being ""Back up your disk while you still can- the end is near""."

I was trying to install ...

That implies the PC was in the process of writing onto the disk."
"ChkDisk coming in on the reboot is expected and normal behaviour, and from what you have typed I cannot tell there being a true problem, other than your half finished installation."
You may have entries in the system logs that will show you at least some detail on what chkdisk actually did.
"If you re-run chkdisk and it tells all is OK (no changes), then you should not need to worry."
SNEV overexpression extends the life span of human endothelial cells.
"In a recent screening for genes down regulated in replicatively senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we have isolated the novel protein SNEV."
"Since then SNEV has proven as a multifaceted protein playing a role in pre-mRNA splicing, DNA repair, and the ubiquitin/proteosome system."
"Here, we report that SNEV mRNA decreases in various cell types during replicative senescence, and that it is increased in various immortalized cell lines, as well as in breast tumors, where SNEV transcript levels also correlate with the survival of breast cancer patients."
"Since these mRNA profiles suggested a role of SNEV in the regulation of cell proliferation, the effect of its overexpression was tested."
"Thereby, a significant extension of the cellular life span was observed, which was not caused by altered telomerase activity or telomere dynamics but rather by enhanced stress resistance."
"When SNEV overexpressing cells were treated with bleomycin or bleomycin combined with BSO, inducing DNA damage as well as reactive oxygen species, a significantly lower fraction of apoptotic cells was found in comparison to vector control cells."
These data suggest that high levels of SNEV might extend the cellular life span by increasing the resistance to stress or by improving the DNA repair capacity of the cells.
A shocking video has been released showing violent scenes which took place as a mass brawl broke out between migrants under the Stalingrad metro in Paris.
At least four people were seriously injured and the area has been completely overwhelmed by the fierce battle.
"Hundreds of migrants can be seen attacking each other with metal poles, planks of wood and other debris in an alarming video, recorded by residents from a close by building."
"The melee erupted Thursday night at around 9:00pm after after police arrested a man for being drunk and disorderly, according to Le Parisien."
The brawl subsides only after police fire tear gas canisters.
"However, clashes break out again around 11.30pm between “hundreds of very excited people who decide to fight,” police told Le Parisien."
"A local resident who spoke to the publication said “there never had been violence until now.” Some 1,000 migrants, mainly from Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan set up camp there in early March after the demolition of the Calais “Jungle” camp."
The camp has been evacuated on two occasions in recent weeks.
"French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve announced the removal of the camp on March 30 in a joint statement with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, but the migrants returned with makeshift mattresses two weeks later, according to Le Parisien."

"Why were social, moral and political issues relatively neglected in philosophy of science during the 20th Century?"
Joel Katzav (Queensland) and Krist Vaesen (Eindhoven) continue their investigation of the institutional and sociological influences on the history and development of analytic philosophy in the following guest post.
"*

The National Science Foundation and the Rise of Value-Free Philosophies of Science

by Joel Katzav & Krist Vaesen

In a series of papers that appeared in 2017 and 2018, we have shown that an important part of the explanation for the rise of analytic philosophy in the twentieth century was the takeover by analytic philosophers of generalist, British and American philosophy journals and the subsequent use of these journals in order to marginalize non-analytic approaches to philosophy (see here, here and, for an overview, here (published) or here (preprint))."
"In our most recent paper, we extend this work on the emergence of analytic philosophy in two ways."
"We show that at least one important funding body was also used to marginalize non-analytic philosophy and we examine how such marginalization affected the development of one specialization in philosophy, namely the philosophy of science (see here)."
G.E.
"Moore by and large excluded philosophical psychology and work sympathetic to Neo-Hegelian idealism from Mind roughly in 1926, not long after he became the journal’s editor."
"In roughly 1948, analytic editors took over The Philosophical Review and turned it from a journal that was open to diverse approaches to philosophy into one that was basically only open to analytic philosophy."
"A similar, though slightly more complex story took place in The Journal of Philosophy just over a decade later."
"In these three cases, the primary form of philosophy excluded from publication was distinguished from analytic philosophy of the time by being speculative, that is, very roughly, by tending to make substantive claims about the world that are epistemically independent of established belief, including commonsense and science."
"Marginalized speculative work included Neo-Hegelian idealism, classical pragmatism, speculative phenomenology and existentialism, process philosophy and approaches to philosophy that grew out of these more familiar ones."
"The story of marginalization also occurred at other journals (e.g., at The Philosophical Quarterly in the late 1950s and at Philosophy and Phenomenological Research in 1980) and was supplemented by the creation of analytic only journals (e.g., Analysis, Philosophical Studies and Noûs)."
"If one looks at which journals were affected by these sectarian practices, one will find a very familiar set of journals; it is roughly the set of the journals that are the most prestigious journals in philosophy today."
"In our more recent paper, we provide evidence for thinking that a similar kind of marginalization occurred at the level of one of Anglo-American philosophy’s sub-fields, namely the philosophy of science."
"The post-WWII years saw the growth of U.S. government funding of science, including the growth of financial support for the sciences by the National Science Foundation (NSF)."
"The first-half of the 1950s saw political pressure, partly associated with McCarthyism, that meant there was hesitation to extend NSF funding to the social sciences."
"In the second half of the 1950s, however, these sciences acquired their own NSF program."
The program included the sub-program “History and Philosophy of Science” (HPS).
"Philosophy of science, too, was in the money."
"However, decisions about allocating NSF funding for philosophy of science were placed in the hands of logical empiricists."
"These philosophers, in their function as NSF advisors, allocated virtually all HPS money during the period 1958-1963 to value-free philosophies of science; similar preference for value-free philosophy of science is likely to have continued throughout the 1960s."
"Moreover, this occurred at a time when there were still many philosophers writing philosophy of science that did deal with social, moral and political concerns (value-laden approaches)."
"The allocation of NSF funds, together with the contemporaneous exclusion of value-laden approaches from the pages of Philosophy of Science (see here) and of pragmatism from The Journal of Philosophy (see here), contributed considerably to philosophy of science’s withdrawal from social concerns."
"Interestingly, some of the figures involved in marginalizing non-analytic work at The Philosophical Review and The Journal of Philosophy, namely Max Black and Sydney Morgenbesser, were also involved in what occurred at the NSF."
"Our work on the HPS sub-program only allows us to say that value-laden philosophy of science was not funded by the HPS, a claim that is weaker than the claim that it only funded logical empiricist or analytic philosophy of science, though the identity of HPS advisors does suggest that this was also the case."
It does seem that philosophy of science was following the same pattern found elsewhere in British and American philosophy.
"That said, the pattern of marginalization in the philosophy of science had its own distinct characteristics."
"For example, NSF funding did not go to philosophy of science that had an historical dimension."
"While this fits what we find in, say, Mind at the time, it does not fit what we find in The Philosophical Review, which did publish a substantial amount of historical work in the 1950s."
"At least part of the reason for the difference is plausibly that, on the one hand, the logical empiricists at the NSF, like the then editor of Mind, Gilbert Ryle, had little sympathy for history informed philosophy while, on the other hand, one of those who was an editor at The Philosophical Review when it decided it would no longer publish speculative philosophy, namely Gregory Vlastos, was an historian of philosophy."
A deeper explanation for the difference is that what drove the sectarian practices of analytic philosophy was the opposition to speculative philosophy.
"Beyond this, there was some room for the opinions of influential individuals to decide for themselves what kind of philosophy would be tolerated."
"Philosophy of science, as it happens, was under the strong influence of individuals with a particularly narrow view of their specialization."
"SDZ PSC 833, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine: its potency in overcoming P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance of murine leukemia."
"Cyclosporin A (CsA, Sandimmune) is known to reverse P-glycoprotein (P-gp170)-mediated multidrug resistance as efficiently as other prototype compounds of resistance modifiers."
"The immunosuppressive activity and nephrotoxicity of CsA, however, may limit its clinical use."
"PSC-833, a new cyclosporine, exerts a similar resistance-modifying activity but lacks toxicity or immunosuppressive activity."
"We have tested its potency in vitro and in vivo on the L1210 leukemia cell line transfected with a full-length cDNA copy of the human mdr I gene, which showed a stable 30-fold resistance towards adriamycin as compared to the parental cell line."
In vitro growth of the transfected cell was unchanged.
In vivo growth was less aggressive; the survival time of inoculated mice was prolonged.
"In vitro, PSC-833 was at least as potent as CsA or verapamil in reversing multidrug resistance."
"In vivo, the drug-resistant L1210 leukemia was completely unresponsive to i.v."
monotherapy with adriamycin at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
PSC-833 enhanced the activity and toxicity of adriamycin.
The MTD of adriamycin was about 3 times lower than when given alone.
"On this basis, the MTD of i.v."
adriamycin in combination with oral PSC-833 successfully overcame refractoriness to treatment.
Survival times of the mice were considerably prolonged and even some cures of leukemic mice occurred.

Span of apprehension deficits in schizophrenia and mania.
Reduced perceptual span has been suggested to be a cognitive marker of vulnerability to schizophrenia.
"However, the specificity of this impairment in visual information processing to schizophrenia is not well established."
This preliminary study examined perceptual span in schizophrenic and manic patients divided into subgroups with and without active symptomatology.
"Symptomatic patients had reduced span in comparison with less symptomatic groups, but there were no differences between schizophrenic and manic patients."

"Q:

Python: Is there a more efficient way to convert int value of months?"
"I have a list of integers [1, 2...40, 41...] that represent months of a few years."
i.e.
"1 is January of year 1, 13 is January of year 2, and so on."
"When trying to convert into just the month integer (all Januarys to 1, etc.)"
I'm using month_int % 12 but it turns December into 0.
I wrote the following small block to catch the Decembers but was wondering if there's a more efficient way?
"for month_int in month_list:
    if not(bool(month_int % 12)):
        # Dec exception here
    else:
        # work as normal

Basically, I want to change lists like this:
[1, 2...12, 13, 14, 15...]
[1, 2...12, 1, 2, 3...]

A:

You are indexing from 1 instead of zero."
"What you can do is subtract 1 and then add 1 to the remainder again:
month = (month - 1) % 12 + 1

A:

fodma1's answer has you covered, but you can do it even shorter:
month = month % 12 or 12

>>> l = [1, 2, 12, 13, 14, 15]
>>> [m % 12 or 12 for m in l]
[1, 2, 12, 1, 2, 3]"
"Re: Keeping him down on the farm

I have probably shared more in my posts on this topic than I should have, but I guess that is necessary in making my points understood."
"I didn't get the ""start"" to farming like so many others did, where their fathers went out of their way to bring a son/daughter into the existing operations by either having enough their to share in it, or investing in some sort of expansion or diversification of the operation to provide that opportunity to their heir apparent."
My father lacked the financial resources to lend this assistance to me.
"My grandfather ""ruled his empire"" with an iron fist, and seemed to not have a clue as to how to ""build up"" his own sons to have the drive and the stamina to expand and succeed."
"My grandfather was the third generation on the land, and had some luck and success in his outside endeavors with non-farm business ventures."
My father was the oldest of five kids.
"He has always been rather bright, and learned a lot about farming by working for others part time while in his teens, and just doing things."
"He moved away for period of time, married my mother, and came back to the farm in a position NOT of financial strength."
He worked for my grandfather as his hired hand for 14 years.
"My dad's youngest brother came back, in the mid-1970's, after he couldn't hack it in the real world, another son in a position NOT of financial strength, but having bachelor's degree in economics and finance."
"My grandfather became less involved in the day to day operations, while working in his off-farm employment and business ventures, but kept his two sons under pretty tight reins."
"The youngest son, as I noted, came back with his ""tail between his legs"" and my grandfather told his oldest son (my father) and his youngest son (12 years younger) ""they were equal partners."""
"That set the tone for a troubled partnership, with the youngest one lacking quite a bit in ""sweat equity,"" but my father didn't openly talk about this ""sore spot"" with anyone."
"My mother went to work for one of those ""off farm business ventures"" my grandfather was involved in as Chairman of the Board and CEO."
Next comes the second eldest son to come and work in that business as Vice-Chairman.
"My mother indicated she had a very good working relationship with my grandfather in that setting, however the relationship with my uncle, her brother in law began to get strained, especially when my grandfather phased into semi-retirement, giving up his position as CEO, but retaining the role as Chairman of the Board until his death."
"That uncle has since retired, and got his money from the business when he sold it."
"As I look at how he managed it though, he managed it poorly from an HR standpoint, because he was rather open about how he viewed himself in that role as ""GOD."""
"The business existed, but it never grew under his ""watch."""
My dad and the rest of his siblings were paid out of their shares of this business when it was sold.
"There is no further legacy of my family in that institution, as it operates under a totally different name today."
The readers of this may wonder what about the other two siblings.
"Well, another uncle, after graduating college, went to work in a nearby town for a financial institution."
"From there, after about 6 years, he moved to a large metro area within that same company, working his way up the corporate ladder and did quite well in life, but I cannot help but wonder what sort of a physical toll it may have taken on him, as he died from a terminal illness."
"My dad's other sibling lived mostly in large, metropolitan areas and worked for a number of years in wholesale for various department stores, and several years later decided to go back to teaching."
"The uncle that came back to the farm, along with his wife, employed some pretty calculated and devious tactics to push me away from the farm for the better part of 25 years, as well as attempts to push my father out of the operation as well."
The farm was split up in the 1990's.
"Both times I moved back, in the hope of working my way into the farm, the assaults upon my being there were ramped up, and after I left both times, they ""played nice"" once again with me, while the deliberate attempts to ""weasel"" their way into those tracts of my father's and under his control would start again."
"Sometimes these were rather subtle, in loaning a piece of equipment to my father, or doing favors, and it never failed, at some time, the uncle would hit him up to rent my dad's farm from him, or ""help him"" always with an ulterior motive."
"When I made my last career move, it involved a physical move from my hometown, to another community a half an hour away."
"Within a few days of the word getting out about that, my farming uncle approached my dad about ""taking over a piece of real estate"" I had been in control of and tending to for the prior 7 years."
"I can only imagine what would have happened if I had moved ""hours away,"" or died!"
My father had a difficult partnership with this brother while they were working together for about 20 years.
"Both my grandparents had to die before my father started talking about all the frustrations he had in his relationship with my grandfather, and ultimately the difficulties he had working with his brother."
"I had been pushed away from the farm by my parents for so many years because: 1) they didn't want me to have any involvement or be subjected to the turmoil in that ""strained partnership"" he with my farming uncle; 2) they didn't want me to come back to the farm in a position of financial weakness; 3) my father and I already had a strained relationship, and he didn't want to see it strained to the degree his relationship had been strained with his own father; and 4) my father felt more like a failure than a success in his farming endeavors."
"It took some growing up and some healing on my part, as well as some healing on my father's part, to start mending things between us."
I grew up in a hardnosed disciplinarian family with two working parents.
"My sibling and I had daily and weekly chores and tasks to complete, and I pitched in to the farming efforts as best I could, while also holding down a part time job, in order to put myself through college."
I resented for some time being pushed away.
"My parents knew of my resentment, but didn't want me to come into a ""minefield"" either."
"Additionally, with the fallout of the farm crisis in the 1980's, rural areas experienced an exodus of their youth out and away from these smaller communities."
"I didn't like the various work places I went to, but at least with every place along the way, I had made new friends, many whom I still have close knit relationships with to this day."
I cannot stress how hard those first 13 years were for me.
"My heart was always on the farm, thus I would try a couple different jobs in very close proximity to that farm, so I could spend my spare time working there, especially in the spring and fall, which I did each and every year I was in high school, college, and every job I had, regardless if I was living and working just a few minutes away from the family farm, or several hours away."
I didn't ask for or expect a dime for my work!
"In 2004 or 2005, I took some time off from work leading up to the weekend."
"My parents had to be away for my sister's college graduation, several states away."
"I asked for a bit of help from a family friend, and he worked the soil ahead of my planting the last few hundred acres of crop that spring."
"Those were some very long days for me, since I was going from 6 am until 9 pm, but we got the job done."
"I don't know for sure, but that determination of mine, along with that effort, seemed to be a turning point for my father in seeing my level of commitment and interest in the family farm."
That also seemed to be a key point in healing the difficult relationship we had between us.
"It was 2 years later, my dad semi-retired and decided to rent the farm to me."
"I maintain my job because it is a good paying job, and I can do most of what I need to do on weekends and my days off from work, along with help from my father."
"He hasn't always agreed with what I have done, but he has seen many of the results have been positive and productive."
He and my mother both regret pushing me away like they had done.
"They also admit to living on the farm and raising us there, was the best place to be."
"I seem to suspect my father regrets not doing more to bring me into the operation several years earlier, as he sees the merits of what I have been able to bring to the operation."
"He has found joy in farming and working with me, something he didn't have in the strained partnership with his brother, or the difficult relationship with his own father."
"I also think he feels now, had I been actively and financially involved 10 or 15 years earlier, he would have found greater success."
"My father, as well as my mom, regret a lot of mistakes they made."
Don't we all!
"They grasp hold of and have realized the interest and the passion I have always had about farming, and regret minimizing or dismissing it for so many years."
"In my own growth, both personally and professionally, I harbor no resentment or ill feelings about what happened in the past."
"As I have shared elsewhere, the struggles, the pain, the doors slammed shut, those outside uncontrollable forces working against me and my interests...................all those negatives, have made me who I am today."
"I would like to think I am a better person as a result, where I am a much better manager, having more confidence in what I am doing."
"I think I am more appreciative of the good things that happen, but also a lot stronger and more resilient when bad things happen."
"By and large, I think I am a more humble and charitable person, realizing there is much more to this world than just me."
"I see to many others who are so ""self absorbed."""
"I think I am more conscientious of my actions, and the after effects of those actions towards others, in wanting to be more considerate of others."
"I have also eluded to the ""chip on my shoulder."""
"I don't very often go there, but I have and will, when someone tries to compare himself to me and suggests ""I have had it made,"" or ""I know exactly what you are going through or been through."""
"That confidence and strength I have gained, has also ingrained a willingness and ability to stand up to others and fight for what I truly believe, or feel threatened over."
I noted some of those outside forces working against me.
"Twenty years ago, I would have avoided certain conflict or confrontation."
That is no longer the case.
"I do exercise tact and diplomacy, but am able to speak with courage, resiliency, and I can and will push back when required."
"When I look at some of my long time acquaintances and peers, who got the start, support, and backing from their father I had wanted so bad, well, I find it rather interesting and enlightening in how I see them handle downturns, failures, and other adversities."
"There were times, when those closest to me, thought I was close to ""breaking"" or ""going over the edge."""
I will admit there were times I did crawl into a bottle and didn't want to come out.
"I had many mornings, when it was physically and mentally painful to put my pants on and go to work on Monday mornings."
I lost my faith for a time.
"I was angry and bitter, and I felt this way for a long time."
"I hated the life I was living, particularly my work life."
I hated where I was living at the time.
I was angry in how I felt it was one bad thing followed by another.
"Part of that anger stemmed from feeling like ""I was a good son."
I did all that everyone had asked of me and then some.
I didn't get into trouble.
I tried to do good things.
Good things are supposed to happen to good people.
I had openly asked God what I had done to deserve this perceived hell I felt I was living in.
"I felt just about everything I had my fingers in turned to ""horse manure."""
My breakthrough started when I made the decision to make my last career move.
Interviewing and accepting that job was exactly what I needed to do.
"I had my eyes so focused on ""the farm,"" that I lacked the peripheral vision to see or look for anything else, and begin to realize it was not meant to be for me to be that full time farmer as I had wanted to much."
"I was blind to the signs God was sending me for so long, or as my father always said, ""I couldn't see the forest through the trees."""
"I had been fighting for, and beating my head against the wall for something that was not intended or planned for me, and I truly believe all that was conditioning and resiliency training I had to go through to make me who and what I am today."
"So back to the question at hand, and why did I go into the depth and detail I did?"
"There are a lot of experiences I shared in HOW NOT to bring in the next generation to not only a family farming operation, but a family business."
Failures are not all bad.
"I failed in my first job out of college, but I learned a lot from that failure."
"Albert Einstein once said, ""Insanity is going the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome."""
Failing once is a lesson.
Failing again for the same reason probably approaches the point of insanity.
"Especially today, I see too many young men coming back to their father's farms, in similar conditions and situations as I tried on two separate occasions, before I started renting my family's farm."
Too little experience and short on financial resources.
"I feel it is imperative for those coming back to the farm to have experience and success off and away from the family farm, before coming back."
Working for somebody other than dad (or family) instills a lot of experiences and traits which cannot be obtained by never working for someone not related.
"I also think it strengthens the work ethic and adds some depth to how to conduct business with others, along with dealing with potential employees."
"I also believe that outside work experience adds a ""removed dimension"" to making business decisions."
"Combine this, with professional success outside the farm, I feel promotes a desire to ""grow one's business"" rather than ""wring whatever one can out of the farm"" and merely exist."
"As I shared above, a tumultuous farming operation with explosive internal dynamics and drama IS NOT conducive to a successful or strong operation."
Recognizing and addressing weaknesses and shortcomings will lead to a quicker failure.
Some commented on another thread about a part time farm/sideline farm is not a successful model.
"Well, I differ with that."
"When a family of 4, such as mine, faces a high cost for health insurance ($22,000/year +) accompanied by high deductibles ($6550 per insured), a full time job with benefits is an advantage worth having to help cover these costs."
Sacrifices must be made by all involved.
My parents could probably get a bit more rent on the farm than what I am paying them.
"I have also invested a lot into that farm myself, in terms of fertility, machinery, drainage, conservation practices, on site facilities, etc., not to mention nearly 3 decades of sweat equity."
This is reflected in their plans for the transition of ownership after their deaths to me and my siblings.
"Sorry for the ""short novel"" I could possibly title ""My Battles and My War."""
"I most certainly shared too much, but those who know me well, know that when a question is asked of me, there are never short, easy answers, and I typically have to lay down a foundation to reinforce my points, before I can answer the question."
"This certainly is one of the longest, though!"

"#Pizzagate – THE FEDS WOULD RATHER DROP A CHILD PORN CASE THAN GIVE UP A TOR EXPLOIT

THE DEPARTMENT OF Justice filed a motion in Washington State federal court on Friday to dismiss its indictment against a child porn site."
It wasn’t for lack of evidence; it was because the FBI didn’t want to disclose details of a hacking tool to the defense as part of discovery.
Evidence in United States v. Jay Michaud hinged at least in part on information federal investigators had gathered by exploiting a vulnerability in the Tor anonymity network.
"“Because the government remains unwilling to disclose certain discovery related to the FBI’s deployment of a ‘Network Investigative Technique’ (‘NIT’) as part of its investigation into the Playpen child pornography site, the government has no choice but to seek dismissal of the indictment,” federal prosecutor Annette Hayes wrote in the court filing on Friday."
"She noted that the DoJ’s work to resist disclosing the NIT was part of “an effort to balance the many competing interests that are at play when sensitive law enforcement technology becomes the subject of a request for criminal discovery.”

In other words, the feds are letting an alleged child pornographer free so that officials can potentially catch other dark-web using criminals in the future."
"Open Tor

The feds have relied on the NIT, which is classified, for evidence in hundreds of other cases."
"Previously, though, the DOJ was able to overturn orders to reveal information about it, or sidestepped disclosure when a defendant pled guilty before trial."
This marks only the second time that federal prosecutors dropped charges rather than expose a secret exploit.
"For years now, federal investigators have used hacking tools to undermine the Tor anonymity network and identify suspects attempting to conceal their identities and actions."
"These Tor exploits help federal law enforcement agencies investigate serious crimes, particularly child porn rings on the dark web, that would otherwise be difficult to prosecute."
"But the DOJ will apparently go to extreme lengths to protect the disclosure of those exploits, raising new questions about the boundaries of investigative hacking."
"In fact, United States v. Jay Michaud has turned out to be a sort of case study, at each legal stage, for how the government may treat NITs in the future."
"Federal investigators arrested school administrator Jay Michaud, of Vancouver, WA, in July 2015 for viewing child pornography."
"The DOJ built their case using a controversial warrant, and in November Congress expanded the DOJ’s ability to get that type of warrant."
"As the case progressed, Judge Robert J. Bryan suggested that the DOJ could use a protective order to give relevant details about the NIT to Michaud’s defense in a limited and controlled way."
Bryan also noted that he did not have the technical expertise to evaluate any DoJ disclosure himself.
"The Justice Department refused to pursue a protective order, though, and ultimately opted to drop charges rather than reveal the secret to even a single person."
"A Wider Net

The controversy in the case didn’t end there, though."
"In May, Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox browser which Tor is also partly based on, filed a brief asking that the government tell the company about the NIT if the vulnerability was present in Firefox, thereby endangering the browser’s users."
The concern about hoarding vulnerabilitiesinstead of disclosing them to be patched is that criminal hackers could find the flaws and maliciously exploit them while the government is keeping them secret for investigative purposes.
"“Mozilla has reason to believe that the exploit that was part of the complete NIT code that this Court ordered the Government to disclose to the defense involves a previously unknown and potentially still active vulnerability in its Firefox code base,” Mozilla wrote in its May submission to the court."
"“Absent great care, the security of millions of individuals using Mozilla’s Firefox Internet browser could be put at risk by a premature disclosure of this vulnerability.”

In United States v. Jay Michaud the indictment will be dismissed without prejudice, meaning that the DoJ can pick the case up again within the statute of limitations (five years in this case) if it chooses."
"Federal investigators may be gambling that they can drop the case for now and pick it up again in a few years when technology has evolved, and the NIT has either been disclosed for other reasons or is no longer effective, says Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society."
“It’s an interesting avenue to think about whether we might start seeing longer gaps between an alleged offense and an indictment if the government is trying to sort of run out the clock on the utility of its hacking methods.” Pfefferkorn says.
"This approach also creates uncertainty for suspects, who are presumed innocent until proven guilty."
"Jay Michaud will have to wait five years knowing that the DoJ has a case against him, but unsure of whether it will ever pursue the prosecution again."
"The drastic measures to hide this exploit may indicate that this particular NIT isn’t just used for domestic criminal cases, but national security investigations as well."
"“Outside of terrorism-related prosecutions in the FISA context, I can’t think of [situations] where the government uses some type of classified surveillance technique to go after regular domestic crimes—it’s pretty unprecedented,” says Mark Rumold, a senior staff attorney at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation."
"The classified status is one of the many techniques DOJ has used to avoid disclosing the NIT, and the government seems to be using cases like United States v. Jay Michaud as a training ground to figure out how to keep hacking tools secret."
"All that’s certain is that the feds have dropped a case against an alleged child pornographer, with some unknowable trade-off down the road."
"“It does seem to provide this moral hazard that if the government believes they can get away with it, that would seem to incentivize them to push the envelope,” Pfefferkorn says."
“And my sense is that the government is continually pushing the envelope in what kind of surveillance it will ask courts to authorize.”
"Kelvinbridge

Kelvinbridge is the common name of the Great Western Bridge, a cast iron road and pedestrian bridge located in the West End of the city of Glasgow, Scotland, built to carry the Great Western Road (A82) at a high level across the River Kelvin."
"Completed in 1891 by Bell & Miller, it replaced an older stone bridge (completed 1840), and has a similar design to the Partick Bridge crossing the same river, located a short distance to the south-west."
It has been a Category A listed structure since 1986.
"In the early 19th century, the first Great Western Bridge (1825) provided a crossing point across the boundary of the city and into the neighbouring burgh of Hillhead, which was incorporated into the city later."
"It was at a low level, whereas the second, larger bridge was built over a high span."
"The river lends its name to adjacent places at several points along its course (Kelvindale, Kelvingrove Park, Kelvinhaugh and Kelvinside for example) and so there are several 'Kelvin Bridges', including one several miles away in Torrance."
Adjacent to the bridge is Kelvinbridge subway station on the Glasgow Subway - one of the deepest on the circuit due to the proximity of the river - on the south east-side of the bridge.
This was also the location of Kelvinbridge railway station on the Glasgow Central Railway.
"Due to these other uses, the name Kelvinbridge is also used to refer to the residential areas in the vicinity of the bridge, encompassing parts of the neighbourhoods of Woodside, Woodlands, Kelvinside and Hillhead."
"The Glasgow Academy private school is nearby on the Hillhead side of the valley, with Lansdowne Church (1863) - featuring a spire which at  is among the tallest structures in the city - on the opposite bank."
"Due to the proximity of the University of Glasgow, the Kelvinbridge locality accommodates many students."

"Helping Christians “Embrace the Erotic”

Most people experience a big disconnect between God and pleasure, body and spirit, says Beverly Dale, a Disciples of Christ minister who promotes positive sexuality in her unique ministry with the Christian Association, a campus ministry at the University of Pennsylvania."
"Dale was recently appointed to the newly-created position of general minister and president of the association, to allow her to devote more time to her ministry, which includes a one-woman performance and experiential workshops to help people understand sexuality in a more holistic way."
"During her work at UPenn over the past 18 years, Dale has developed PassionWorks, which helps Christians reconnect with their bodies, heal their sexual wounds, and embrace the erotic."
"â€œSex-negative Christianity gets all the headlines, and that leads to bowing down to the unholy trinity which, according to [tantric spirituality pioneer] Margo Anand, is fear, shame and guilt,â€ Dale said in an interview with DisciplesWorld."
"She is unaware of anyone else with a similar ministry, but believes that the need is there and often, unmet."
"â€œThereâ€™s a lot of people out there in unhappy marriages,â€ Dale commented."
"â€œWhen I look at those kinds of statistics, it really does show the vast need for a sex-positive theology that will not only help people address the pain and the void but give them permission to discover and celebrate their sexual selves as part of their spiritual journeys.â€

Instead of celebrating sexuality, many people repress sexual expression, split the body from the spirit, and denigrate the body."
"As a result, the impulse to life, which Dale calls the erotic impulse, seeks expression someplace else for some kind of healing."
People who feel disconnected from their own body selves become more likely to escape into addictions or unhealthy behaviors.
"â€œIt will come out,â€ said Dale."
"â€œItâ€™s whether it comes out in ethical ways, or perversions and violence.â€"
CNN's Brooke Baldwin speaks to a mother and daughter about what it's like to live inside of a coronavirus containment zone and how they've adjusted their lifestyle as a result.
"Q:

Decrypting an encrypted text out of order

Does there exist a cipher that can be encrypted twice with two different keys and then decrypted twice using either key first?"
"For example:
Plaintext is ""Lemons are great!"""
"Encode with Key #1
Encode with Key #2
Decode with Key #1
Decode with Key #2
Result is ""Lemons are great!"""
"To my understanding TLS does something like this, but I'm not sure."
"I've also tried reading about elliptical curve cryptography to no avail (of useful understanding, that is)."
I've also tried my own tests with OpenSSL but I feel like it's salting things and therefore is making it not work.
"I understand this is possible with a ROT(n), but that's of course not considered cryptographically secure."
"A:

$\operatorname{ROT}(n)$ is also known as the Caesar cipher."
$\operatorname{ROT}(n)$ can be thought of as a character based stream cipher.
It works because addition - the encryption method used - is commutative.
"In other words
$\operatorname{ROT}(x, \operatorname{ROT}(y, m)) = \operatorname{ROT}(y, \operatorname{ROT}(x, m))$."
Another well known commutative function is $\operatorname{XOR}$.
"It is used by the one time pad, but - more practically - also for block ciphers in streaming mode."
So you can encrypt using AES in CTR mode using two different keys in any order and get the same ciphertext.
And decryption will work in any order as well.
Note that you should use an IV or nonce if you reuse the keys.
Reusing a key stream generated from the key and IV breaks confidentiality.
Together with $\operatorname{XOR}$ it breaks the scheme as you can XOR out the key stream.
[Treatment of metastatic brain tumors: effect of surgery of multiple metastatic brain tumors and systemic metastasis with special reference to quality of life].
"To assess the efficacy of surgical resection of brain metastases from patients with multiple brain metastases or/and with other systemic metastases, the authors analysed treatment results of 90 cases of metastatic brain tumors."
The patients were divided into three groups.
Group A (nine cases): Patients with single brain tumor and their primary cancers were well controlled.
Their brain tumors were removed surgically and followed by radiation.
"Their mean survival time was 17.0 months, and 14.6 months were independent (Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 70) in cases of lung cancer."
Five patients (55.6%) improved by treatment.
Group B (21 cases): Patients with multiple brain metastases or/and with systemic metastases.
Their brain tumor(s) which gave rise to neurological symptoms were surgically removed in order to improve their quality of life.
"In cases of lung cancer, mean survival time was 9.5 months and 7.1 months were independent."
11 patients (52.3%) improved by treatment.
Group C (60 cases): Patients treated conservatively.
Their mean survival time was 4.9 months and 2.7 months were independent in cases of lung cancer.
Only 13 patients (21.7%) improved by treatment.
However 23 (38.3%) deteriorated in their quality of life during treatment.
Two patients of this group had single brain tumor and their primary cancers were controlled well.
They refused surgery.
"Their mean survival time was 13.0 months, and 7.0 months were independent."
These times were statistically shorter than group A.
Seven patients had similar systemic and neurological states as those in group B.
Their mean survival time was 5.0 months and 3.0 months were independent.
These times were also statistically shorter than those in group B.

"MB Mallets, Inc."
"Welcome to MB Mallets

MB Mallets Inc. is owned and operated by Michael Baker in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada."
We work diligently to offer the best possible hand-made timpani sticks at affordable prices.
"MB Mallets also does custom bamboo fitting including diameter, weight and length."
Most Custom fitting is usually at the same price as seen on the products page.
"History

Michael hails from a family of professional musicians, opera singers and artists."
His international career has encompassed virtually every style of playing.
"Studio drummer that include Nashville hits with Cheryl Keela, Canadian country music icon Gary Fjellgaard, orchestral percussionist with Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles freelancer and the Pan American Percussion Ensemble directed by Jorge Sarmientos."
Michael at the invitation of then Dallas Symphony Music Director Eduardo Mata recorded the Carlos Chavez Partita for Solo Timpani at RCA New York.
This was part of a Chavez recording project with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra Percussion and Winds.
He subsequently performed the world premier in Mexico City in 1982.
He also has performed in most of the major concert venues around the world as the founding Principal Timpanist of the Mexico City Philharmonic.
It was no surprise to anyone in the family that at about age three he took out the pots and pans from under the stove.
His mom's wooden spoons were the ideal sticks at the time.
As a teenager Michael purchased a pair of then rarely available commercially made timpani sticks.
This quickly led to wood turning lessons from his father on an antique lathe.
He was then able to hand cut his first sticks in walnut.
These became the go-to sticks for many years until his studies with Cloyd Duff at the Cleveland Institute of Music.
"It seems a quirk of fate that these very first sticks in walnut are now years later, the MB Series I student model sticks."
"Over the years MB Mallets Inc. has developed and produced many original designs that include the Peter Kogan models and the George Brown models and, the original North American Black Magic ®."
The Peter Kogan models currently produced were from an original custom order from Peter.
We were able to adapt his core and underlay concepts with the various MB coverings to produce a large/light stick that works well on both calf and synthetic heads.
The George Brown models came about as Michael suggested Custom designed mallets for George's world premier of the Dan Welcher Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra.
"George, also a student of Cloyd Duff, helped analyse our many prototypes and new design ideas."
Most of these prototypes eventually became the MB-GB line.
The Black Magic® stick is an original design that resulted from numerous conversations with Concertgebouw Orchestra Timpanist Nick Woud.
This stick is designed for synthetic heads.
MB can also make a softer version for calf heads.
MB Mallets uses high quality German felts in various densities and red felt unique to our Company.
We also use a material we refer to as hybridfelt ® that is custom made for us and unique to MB Mallets Inc.
The MB Mallets Directors and Advisors have a combined 175 years of timpani mallet experience.

Developmental trajectories of aggressive behavior in children from ages 8 to 10: The role of sex and hormones.
"This study explored the developmental trajectory of aggressive behavior from age 8 to age 10 in school-aged children, taking into account possible sex differences, as well as the involvement of certain hormones."
Participants were 90 children (49 boys and 41 girls) from four schools.
"At the beginning of the study, the children were 8-year old and were in 3rd grade of primary school."
The second data collection phase was carried out two years later (at age 10) when the children were in 5th grade (primary).
"Their aggressive behavior was measured by the Direct and Indirect Aggression Scale, an instrument which uses peer rating."
"Hormone levels, testosterone, cortisol and estradiol were analyzed using an enzymoimmunoassay technique in saliva samples."
"The results revealed a difference in aggressive behavior between the ages of 8 and 10, in boys only, who were found to be more aggressive at age 10."
A regression analysis revealed that cortisol and estradiol contributed to explaining the changes observed in aggressive behavior in boys.
Boys whose cortisol levels rose most between the ages of 8 and 10 were also those whose aggressive behavior increased most during the same timeframe.
"Moreover, boys whose estradiol levels rose most between the ages of 8 and 10 were also those whose aggressive behavior decreased most during the same timeframe."
"Our results highlight the importance of studying aggressive behavior from a longitudinal perspective, taking into account sex differences and biological measures."

For more than a decade, the New England Patriots have been considered the NFL's golden standard for prolonged success."
"Since 2000, their five Super Bowl appearances are more than any team in the NFL."
Their three Super Bowl championships also lead the league.
"Since finishing 5-11 in coach Bill Belichick's first season, the Patriots have posted a winning record every year."
"They've reached double-digit wins in 11 straight seasons, and could make it 12 straight with a victory Sunday at Lambeau Field."
"If anyone knows what NFL success looks like, it's Belichick."
"Which, in context, added substantial credibility to Belichick's praise of the Green Bay Packers on Wednesday morning."
"""The Packer tradition and the history is up there probably ahead of every other team in the National Football League, certainly in terms of titles and Hall of Fame players and all of that,"" Belichick said."
"""So history, they're the oldest franchise in the NFL and the smallest market."
So what the Green Bay Packers stand for and what they've built and what that community and their relationship with the team (has built) is unique and incredible.
"Nobody has more respect for it than I do."""
"It's been a while, but Belichick used to share a division with Green Bay."
"He was with the Detroit Lions as an assistant special teams coach in 1976, and a wide receivers coach in 1977."
The Packers and Lions split their four games in those two seasons.
"On paper, the Patriots are one of the few teams that can compete with the Packers' historical resume."
Green Bay has won four Super Bowl titles (one more than New England) and appeared in five Super Bowls (two fewer than New England).
"So when the Packers and Patriots meet at 3:25 p.m. Sunday inside Lambeau Field, their status as two of the best teams in the NFL this season won't be the anything that makes for a compelling matchup."
Belichick said this game – not the history behind it – will be the only thing on my mind.
"""That's not really what this game's about,"" Belichick said."
"""This game's about two teams, very competitive teams that are going to match up Sunday afternoon, and hopefully we can play a very competitive game against them."
It's been a problem for the other teams that have come in there and tried to play them.
The game's been pretty much over by the second quarter.
"So hopefully we can play them more competitively than that."""

"Box-office: With Simmba hitting a double ton, Ranveer Singh is now ahead of Ranbir Kapoor."
"Here’s how

With Simmba hitting a double ton at the box-office, Ranveer Singh is now ahead of Ranbir Kapoor."
Wondering how?
Read on to find out.
"Box-office: Ranveer is now ahead of Ranbir&nbsp

As Simmba officially became the part of the esteemed Rs 200 crore-club on Wednesday, its lead star Ranveer Singh became the only Hindi film actor besides Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan to have more than one Rs 200 crore-film in his kitty."
The quirky actor had earlier hit a double ton with the last year’s Padmaavat.
"Simmba, in its 12-day run at the box-office, has fetched a monumental Rs 202.83 crore."
But that’s hardly news as the film’s opening-weekend performance was enough to suggest that it was destined to make it big.
"The story behind the story is that with Simmba with crossing the Rs 200 crore-mark, Ranveer has left behind Ranbir Kapoor in the box-office race."
Wondering how?
Let us explain.
"Ranveer, as we told you, already has two Rs 200 crore-films to his credit."
"But Ranbir, who the actor is often compared to given the similar magnitude of their respective fan bases, only has one film in the coveted club – the last year’s Sanju that went on to earn over Rs 340 crore."
"So currently, the Gully Boy of Bollywood is leading against the Bollywood’s Rockstar by one Rs 200 crore-grosser."
"(Thanks to Padmaavat and Simmba, Ranveer Singh joins Salman Khan in the ‘Rs 500 crore club’)

Interestingly, the other gen-next stars such as Varun Dhawan, Tiger Shroff, Sidharth Malhotra, Vicky Kaushal, Rajkummar Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana are yet to make their debut in the double ton club."
"Ranveer, on the other hand, has created yet another record with the stupendous success of Simmba."
He is now the only actor besides Salman Khan to make over Rs 500 crore at the box-office in a year.
"Simmba, directed by Rohit Shetty, hit the screens on December 28, 2018."
"Box-office: With Simmba hitting a double ton, Ranveer Singh is now ahead of Ranbir Kapoor."
"Here’s howDescription:With Simmba hitting a double ton at the box-office, Ranveer Singh is now ahead of Ranbir Kapoor."

"ABOUT THE BLAZERS: UAB enters the week at 5-4 overall, 0-0 in Conference USA play (the Blazers begin their league schedule vs. Saint Louis on Mar."
"16)...UAB took two of three games from Lipscomb University over the weekend, losing 6-0 on Friday, winning 17-5 on Saturday and 4-3 on Sunday...the Blazers are in three games into a 12-game home stand that will continue through Mar."
11.
"UAB vs. SOUTH ALABAMA: The Blazers and Jaguars go way back as opponents (to the 1979 season, UAB's first as an NCAA team)...the two teams have met 82 times over the years -- the most by UAB vs. any opponent in school history -- and South Alabama holds a 52-30 lead in the series...most of those meetings came when both schools were members of the Sun Belt Conference (UAB left the SBC following the 1991 season)...last season the teams split a pair of regular season games, with the Jags winning 5-4 in Mobile (2/20/00, part of South Alabama's Coca-Cola Classic tournament) and UAB winning 5-3 in Birmingham (5/9/00 at Young Memorial Field)...Tueday's game is the only scheduled meeting between the two in 2001."
"UAB vs. MIDDLE TENNESSEE: Considering the fact that UAB and MTSU have never been a member of the same conference, they certainly have played a lot of games against each other, the two have met 60 times dating back to the 1980 season (the most by UAB vs. any non-league opponent), with UAB holding a 34-26 edge...last season, the two split four regular season games, with UAB winning two games in Birmingham (5-3, 6-4 on 3/21-22/00 at Young Memorial Field) and the Blue Raiders winning twice in Murfreesboro (4-2, 6-2 on 3/28-29/00)."
"UAB vs. TENNESSEE TECH: UAB leads the all-time series with the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles 17-5, dating back to the 1991 season...last season, the two split four regular season games, with UAB winning twice in Cookeville (10-3, 5-3 on 3/4-5/00) and Tennessee Tech winning twice in Birmingham (6-3, 7-3 on 4/18-19/00 at Young Memorial Field)."
"WE LIKE TENNESSEE: The Blazers are in the midst of an 11-game stretch in which 10 games will be played against teams from the state of Tennessee (Tennessee Tech-3, Lipscomb-3, Vanderbilt-2, Middle Tennessee, Belmont)...the only non-Tennessee team during that stretch?"
The South Alabama Jaguars.
"STARTING PITCHERS: The projected starter for Tuesday's South Alabama game is right-hander Ross Dobbins (2-0, 0.75 ERA), the projected starter for Wednesday's game vs. Middle Tennessee is lefthander Adam Wood (0-0, 0.00 ERA), a true freshman who would be making his collegiate debut."
Both players are newcomers to the UAB team in 2001.
"UNFAMILIAR FACES: The 33-man 2001 UAB Baseball roster includes 20 newcomers (nine pitchers), six of whom were in the starting lineup on opening day (Feb. 13) vs. Alabama State...so for a while at least, you truly won't be able to tell the players without a scorecard."
FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS: The 2001 Blazers will play 19 of their first 22 games in the friendly confines of Young Memorial Field.
"UAB doesn't embark on a major road swing until late March, when the team plays four straight games away from home."
DO WE SEE A PATTERN HERE?
": Of the 33 players on the 2001 roster, 25 have junior college playing experience, and nine played at Central Alabama Community College, not coincidentally the former employer of UAB Head Coach Larry Giangrosso...many of those from CACC played at least one season for Giangrosso and virtually all were recruited during his tenure there."
"COACH GINO:Larry Giangrosso, a 1975 graduate of UAB, is now in his second season as the Blazer skipper, and has a 33-36 (.478) mark."
"""Coach Gino"" came to UAB from Central Alabama Community College (Alexander City, Ala.) where he posted a 320-183-1 (.636) mark in nine seasons (1990-99)."
CACC was the 1998 Alabama Junior & Community College Conference Division I champions.
"Prior to his time at CACC, he was the head coach at W.A."
"Berry High School in suburban Birmingham, where he was 254-115 (.688) in 11 seasons (1979-89)."
The Bucs took the 1981 AHSAA championship and were five-time regional champions.
"THE STAFF: Giangrosso is assisted by Lee Hall (Auburn-Montgomery, 1990), who played for (Berry HS) and coached with (CACC) Giangrosso and Frank Walton (UAB, 1990), who played (1983-84) and coached previously (1992-99) at UAB."
"Tim Harradine, who served as a team manager during the 2000 season, is the volunteer assistant coach."
"A LONG ONE: The 8-7 loss to Southern Illinois in 15 innings (2/17/01) was the second-longest game in UAB baseball history, surpassed only by a 19-inning affair vs. South Alabama in Mobile (5/16/81)."
"The game was the longest home game ever for UAB and the longest ever at Young Memorial Field (the previous mark for both was 14 innings, both against South Alabama, at Rickwood Field in 1981 and at Young Memorial Field in 1990)."
"Ironically, all of those games (including this year's SIU marathon) were one-run losses for the Blazers."
INJURY REPORT: Three UAB players are currently unavailable because of injury.
"Left-handed pitcher Michael Stallings (7-9 in 2000, 5.84 ERA) will miss the entire season after undergoing shoulder surgery (rotator cuff), as will infielder Matt Womble (a newcomer in 2001), who also had shoulder surgery."
"Fifth-year senior right-handed pitcher Lee Jolly's (4-3, 4.48 ERA in 2000) status is uncertain for the 2001 season, he has an elbow injury in his pitching arm and a decision has not been made about when he might return to the lineup."
FATHER AND SON CONNECTION(s): Blazer head coach Larry Giangrosso and redshirt freshman catcher Pete Giangrosso are indeed father and son.
"The Giangrosso are not, however, the first father and son coach-player duo in UAB athletic history, the first was Gene and Murry Bartow."
"Murry, now the head men's basketball coach at UAB, played for his legendary dad on Blazer basketball teams from 1980-85 (he was also a member of the UAB Golf team)."
Murry Bartow graduated from Birmingham's W.A.
"Berry High School in 1980, and one of his coaches and teachers there was....Larry Giangrosso."
THE FRIENDLY CONFINES: Young Memorial Field has been the primary home of Blazer Baseball since the 1984 season.
"Th stadium is named for the late Dr. Jerry D. Young (1931-83), who, as a Vice President at UAB in the late 1970s, was a major force in the establishment of an intercollegiate athletic program at UAB."
"In 17+-seasons, the Blazers are 308-182-1 (.627) at Young Memorial Field, and are 4-3 in 2001."
THE NEW WALL: One major cosmetic change has been made at UAB's Young Memorial Field for the 2001 season.
"A new wood outfield fence -- painted Blazer Green -- was completed just before the beginning of the season, replacing the chain-link fencing that had enclosed the field since 1984."
"The ballpark now has slightly larger dimensions, going 330 feet down the lines, 370 feet to the left center power alley, 400 feet to dead center field, and 360 feet to the right center power alley."
"In addition, the large ""hitter's eye"" in center field (also now green) has been fused with the fence (it was previously behind the outfield fence and a ball striking it was considered a home run) and is now in play."
"GARNER PRODUCES: Shortstop Mark Garner has reached base 21 times in 35 plate appearances thus far in 2001, and leads UAB with a .600 on-base percentage (it's no surprise that he is tied for the team lead with nine runs scored in the first nine games)...Garner also has the best batting average of any of the every-day players (.500) and is tied for the team with nine RBIs...Garner hit .585 five games last week, three RBI, four runs scored and two stolen bases...he was also perfect in the field in 19 chances (andwas part of two double plays)...Garner hit a dramatic two-out home run in the bottom of the 12th inning in the Feb. 17 game vs. Southern Illinois to tie the game at 7-7 and keep the Blazers alive."
"DOBBINS DOMINANT: Righthander Ross Dobbins (2-0) was impressive once again in his start at Belmont (2/20)...he allowed no runs on three hits in seven complete innings, with one walk and three strikeouts as he collected his second win in as many starts...for the season, Dobbins has a 0.75 ERA with two walks and 12 strikeouts (for a nifty 1-6 ratio) in 12 innings of work."
"MR. JONES: Sophomore outfielder Mitch Jones (a Freshman All-America in 2000) has been the Blazers' leadoff hitter in all nine games to date...he is currently batting .275 with one double, one home run and four RBI...Jones is tied for the team lead in runs scored with nine and walks with six, and is second on the team with 11 hits...he has a .370 on-base percentage (reaching 17 times in 46 plate appearances)... he has reached base six of 16 times when leading off an inning this season (.375) .. Jones also leads the team in stolen bases with seven (7-8 through nine games) ...he hit .467 in the Southern Illinois series (Feb. 16-18), but struggled a bit last week, hitting .190 in five games."
"BIG FELLA: At 6-4 and close to 280 pounds, junior designated hitter/first baseman Chris George stands out just about anywhere, but especially on the baseball field...George is hitting .270 through nine games with four doubles (he is amazingly mobile) and is tied for the team lead with nine RBIs...his first home run as a Blazer came at a very opportune moment, the two-run shot in the fith inning vs. Lipscomb Sunday (2/25) gave UAB a 4-2 lead and proved to be the game-winner as the Blazers prevailed, 4-3...George is also a very solid defensive player, entering this week he was perfect in 59 chances as a first baseman, including several very nifty unassisted plays in the Lipscomb series."
"AW HECK: Junior catcher Al Hecklinski has already made a mark in his first season as a Blazer, hitting .321 over nine games with two home runs and seven RBIs (second on the team)...the Birmingham native hit solo homers vs. Vanderbilt and Lipscomb and hit .385 (5-13, 2 RBIs) over five games last week."
"ON DECK: Following the games vs. South Alabama (Feb. 27), Middle Tennesee (Feb. 28), and the weekend series with Tennessee Tech (Mar."
"2-4), UAB will host Vanderbilt (Mar."
6) and will play a three-game weekend series with Eastern Illinois (Mar.
9-11).
"S[ir]{.smallcaps}---During the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) pandemic, hospitals have canceled elective surgeries and other procedures in children in order to re‐allocate resources and decrease transmission of the COVID‐19 virus."
"[^1^](#pan13884-bib-0001){ref-type=""ref""} However, sedation/anesthetic care for specific subsets of infants and children still needs to be provided."
"For example, infants or children with oncologic disease need surveillance with lumbar punctures, bone marrow biopsy/aspiration, radiological imaging studies during their treatment, in addition to intrathecal chemotherapy."
"Children with extremity fractures, new diagnoses of severe headache, back pain, ataxia, stroke symptoms, and septic arthritis, may also require urgent diagnostic (eg, radiological imaging) or therapeutic procedures (eg, fracture reduction/casting, diagnostic joint aspiration)."
"While some anesthesiologists may advocate for securing the airway of COVID‐19 patients with a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway to eliminate the possibility of aerosol generation during the case; outside of this COVID‐19 pandemic, the vast majority of sedation for many diagnostic or therapeutic procedures are performed outside the operating room using natural airway sedation by pediatric subspecialists including pediatric anesthesiologists, with a high success rate and a very low incidence of adverse events."
"[^2^](#pan13884-bib-0002){ref-type=""ref""} Natural airway sedation performed without airway instrumentation using intravenous agents such as propofol, dexmedetomidine, or ketamine eliminates the need for an ETT or laryngeal mask airway."
"A systematic review published in 2013 that reported the odds of exposure to the SARS‐Corona virus due to aerosol generation were much lower with suction, administration of oxygen, or manual ventilation compared to airway intubation."
"[^3^](#pan13884-bib-0003){ref-type=""ref""} We therefore suggest that natural airway sedation is an attractive option in some of these patients, and sedation/anesthesia providers should consider the option of natural airway sedation for imaging and other minor procedures rather than general endotracheal anesthesia in order to reduce aerosol particle generation during the COVID‐19 pandemic."
Monitoring via nasal cannula with end‐tidal CO2 (EtCO2) detection capacity should still be used and a regular isolation mask applied to over this nasal cannula.
"Other advantages that associated with this technique in well‐organized sedation programs include shorter duration of sedation, faster recovery, and prompt discharge of the patient which ultimately results in decreased exposure of staff to the patient and lower healthcare cost and resource utilization."
"[^4^](#pan13884-bib-0004){ref-type=""ref""}

Furthermore, we advocate for a telehealth prescreening evaluation and subsequent multi‐disciplinary discussion among the sedation team to ensure optimal patient selection and risk stratification."
"We suggest the exclusion of high‐risk patients such as those with difficult airways, respiratory distress, copious secretions, American Society of Anesthesiologists‐Physical Status classification \>3, and history of previous anesthesiology consultation."
"We also urge anesthesia/sedation providers to strictly adhere to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (endorsed by ASA, AANA, APSF) on PPE, N95, and other institution dependent infection control measures to decrease transmission of COVID‐19 even if natural airway sedation is performed."

"Ujiri has emerged as a rising star among league front-office executives and had been the 76ers’ primary target along with new Atlanta Hawks GM Danny Ferry, sources said."
"The 76ers have narrowed the search and appear to be leaning toward promoting assistant GM Tony DiLeo to the GM job, league sources said."
"The 76ers had considered former New Orleans Hornets GM Jeff Bower, but as the Philadelphia Inquirer recently reported, DiLeo has emerged as the favorite to take over for Thorn."
"The Sixers’ ownership group had believed it could lure Ujiri, one of the lowest-paid GMs in the league, with a $2 million-plus annual package, sources said."
"Nevertheless, Ujiri’s strong relationship and trust in Denver president Josh Kroenke and owner Stan Kroenke, as well as his investment in a promising roster, led him to stay the course in Denver."
"Ujiri has a year left on his original three-year deal, and Denver will likely need to secure him with a long-term commitment to stave off future suitors.”"

No."
English is the lingua franca of Stack Overflow (some would dare say programming).
"If you tell someone they can answer in Spanish just to solve your problem, that leaves everyone else who uses this site that doesn't speak Spanish out in the cold."
That would be akin to going into a Chinese web forum and asking them to post their answer in English.

"Each year, roughly 30,000 youth exit the foster care system due to aging out at age 18, losing access to support services while also becoming fully responsible for their own financial, health, employment, and housing needs."
"Progressing from homes disproportionately high in neglect and maltreatment, these emerging adults face independence with an increased likelihood of heavy tobacco use and, ultimately, the development of tobacco use disorders."
"Indeed, lifetime tobacco use is nearly ubiquitous among foster youth, while daily use rates are four times that of the general population."
"Services to curtail such use while young people remain in the foster care system are severely limited, if they are offered at all."
"Once removed from foster care, these youth have far less access to health services compared to their non-foster care peers."
"The proposed feasibility study seeks to address these gaps in availability, accessibility, and use of tobacco cessation services for youth aging out of the foster care system."
Computer- and mobile phone-based interventions have the capacity to provide evidence-based treatment content while reducing many of the barriers relevant to tobacco cessation service delivery for foster youth.
The proposed study will begin a program of research to synthesize the benefits of these approaches in a way that addresses the needs of a vulnerable population who experience tobacco-related health disparities.
"More specifically, this study seeks to test an adaptation of an existing substance use intervention (iHeLP: Interactive Healthy Lifestyle Preparation) for smoking cessation among youth aging out of foster care."
"Rooted in motivational interviewing, the transtheoretical model, and social cognitive theory, iHeLP is a one-time computerized screening and brief intervention (SBI), supplemented by six months of tailored text messaging based on participants' SBI results and subsequent fluctuations in their readiness to change."
"The goal of this pilot study is to obtain data on acceptability and feasibility of a novel intervention, as well as examine direction of effects on both overall motivation to change and actual tobacco use."
"As such, we will conduct a two-arm feasibility trial, testing iHeLP against a contact-control condition."
The use of daily text messaging represents a novel method for delivering intervention boosters.
"Low-intensity, high-frequency interactions are a marked change from traditional interventions and have high potential for extending initial gains."
"In addition, tailoring of these messages through dynamic, text-based communication with participants is innovative."
"Given the potential of wide dissemination to multiple at-risk populations at low cost, the proposed study has high potential public health and clinical significance."
"Ode To My Mother

My Rock, My Inspiration, My Mother!"
This is a story of inspiration.
I am writing this because it will help me purge the sadness I have inside me today.
"My heart is heavy because my Mother was supposed to be here today, we were supposed to celebrate her Birthday today."
"Instead, I was left waking to a bitter cold January day that left me not wanting to face the day."
"My Mother passed away October 2, 2015 and on that day, a part of me died too."
"Her absence is palpable, so very real to me."
So many days I catch myself saying ” I should call Mom and tell her…..” So many days I drive by her subdivision and think I should turn in and visit her.
"It was such a common thing for me to call her, just to talk."
I remember how she could tell something was wrong just by the tone of my voice.
She and I were cut from the same cloth as my sister and Father were cut from the same cloth.
"I think that is why my parents could understand one of us and be confounded by the other, we are truly mirrors of them."
"If my Mother liked you, she would do anything to help you."
"She was generous with her time, with her money, with her love."
"On the other hand, if you wronged her, there was no force on this planet that could change her mind."
"To her life was cut and dry, she knew what she liked and knew what she didn’t."
She was an unreal judge of character; often correct where I had given someone the benefit of the doubt.
"This didn’t make her better or worse than anyone else, just uniquely her."
"For all her strengths and weaknesses, she was just Mom to me and my sister Diane."
"The Angel And The Demon

When my Mother was sober, she was the most kind person I know."
She was truly a heartfelt and loving person.
"When she drank, she was an entity that was hard to reconcile with the kind person."
"It was like polar opposites, she would cut you to the quick."
Those years were hard to deal with because the polarity was confusing.
People often ask me why I don’t get too excited for things like holidays.
"Well, in families like mine, you couldn’t really count on anything being concrete."
Our lives were in constant flux depending on the amount of alcohol ingested.
I just adjusted by never having expectations of anyone except myself.
"Where I felt I couldn’t count on other people, I became internally self reliant."
"I believed I could do anything, not fearing any consequence."
I lived life with little fear or regard for my safety of well being.
"My fear was in my home, not outside of it."
"I learned that I needed to take care of myself, to expect anything, and to be beyond prepared for anything."
The angel version of my Mother was the most intensely proud Mother who would not stand for people attacking her family or her children.
The demon side of my Mother was the person who would attack her family and her children.
That is the crushing fallout of alcoholism.
"Which person would you see that day, the angel or the demon?"
"Too often in my youth, I saw the demon."
"Cancer, St. Patricks Day, and Sobriety

Some 20 years ago, I literally thought my Mother would drink herself to death."
She would wake up and drink til she passed out on the couch.
She would wake up and drink again.
"This cycle repeated itself often for years, too many to think about."
It was easier to recall the days she was sober back then.
"Well, my Mother got a scare that she might have cancer."
"She made a pact with God that if he made sure she didn’t have cancer, she would stop drinking."
This is a woman who had been to in patient rehab 3 times and a fourth when we sent her to Canada to live with my Aunt Carol.
So I had little belief that it would work.
My Mother is the daughter of two very stubborn Irish parents.
"My Grandparents both were born in Northern Ireland and came from abject poverty, so they understood sacrifice."
My Mother also understood it as she was born not even a decade of the 1929 stock market crash.
"She lost her father at a young age and quit school to support the family, working two jobs."
"Like most Irish people, she was tough as nails."
"So on that fateful St. Patrick’s day, in an irony to top all irony, she stopped drinking cold turkey."
What self respecting Irish person stops drinking on St. Paddy’s Day?
"Hell, I would have said “Let’s start this tomorrow!” That is how she was, strong as steel."
Why Does This Happen To Me?
"It seemed that after my Mother got sober, there was a series of cataclysmic events that would shake the foundations of my Mothers life."
"Not long after her sobriety, my Father and Mother were remarried."
The sad part was that they did so after my Father was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.
He passed away in October of 1998.
This is when things started to go south.
I bought my Mom and English Bulldog to keep her company.
"We named him Mac(short for McDougall, my fathers middle name)."
"Well, in December, just before Christmas, half of my Mothers house burnt down due to an electrical fire."
"Then when she moved back in in July, they didn’t connect the AC."
She left for work and the house got very hot.
She came home and Mac was having a seizure due to the house being so hot.
"He had surgery and out of 5 bulldogs who went into the vet that day, he was the only one to live."
The next issue was a horrific car accident where a van ran a red light and hit my Mom in her Dodge Neon head on.
"She had 18 rib fractures, 2 pelvic fractures, and a compression fracture of her spine."
"Well, due to her being unable to drive or move well, she took Mac to the groomer."
She told them to let him air dry.
They put him in a drying crate and killed him due to overheating.
My Mother was crushed.
"The lady who owns that business was so callous, I wanted to punch her right in the face."
So we got her a new dog named Maggie and things were looking up.
"Well, they held up for a while until a few years down the line."
"As fallout from her accident, she had to have spinal fusion."
"After spinal fusion, her hip went bad."
She literally walked the ball off of it before she got hip replacement.
That was also from the accident.
Then a year later Maggie was diagnosed with cancer and my Mom had to put her down.
She was devastated.
"Well, my Mom worked for me at our gym and two members were dog breeders."
They bred French Bulldogs and Shorty Bulls.
They loved my Mom and gave her a $2000 pup we named Cullen (Irish warrior).
Well things went from bright to bad not long after.
My Mom fell at home rupturing her spleen and almost bleeding to death.
She was saved with emergency surgery.
"During that surgery, they noticed a spot on her lung."
We waited hoping for the best.
Our worst fears were realized when she was diagnosed with lung cancer.
"Due to poor lung quality from years of smoking, chemo was the only viable option."
"She fought like a champ and was holding it at bay for 2 plus years when she fell one morning, shattering her hip and femur."
"At that point, she had surgery and was stuck in long term care."
No more chemo due to her condition.
"She then contracted C-Diff, a nasty GI infection that kept recurring."
She spent most of 6 months in long term care in quarantine so as not to infect other residents.
She was finally released in June where she lived out her last days.
"No Sadness, Just Reality

I don’t tell anyone these things to champion my Mother."
She was human and frail just like everyone else.
She had weakness of character like anyone else.
She did things wrong like anyone else.
Where she differed from most is that she never felt sorry for herself.
"In a quiet moment, she once asked “What did I do to deserve this?” That was the most I ever heard her say about it and we shared everything."
"My sister said I was the “Golden Child”, that I could do no wrong."
I don’t think that was it.
"My Mom knew I was like her, that I will persevere through thick and thin, fighting the good fight, fighting until my last heart beat."
That is how life should be lived.
Like a warrior who fights on no matter how dire the circumstances.
Why not fight?
Why give in?
I watched my Mother go through all these tragedies and do so with grace.
I watched her stare death down until her body gave in.
Her mind and her spirit fought on until the body had nothing left to give.
That is how you live life.
You live it fully and courageously.
"You live it by giving to others, by being kind."
"You live life by grinding through every single roadblock, no matter how insurmountable."
That is why I tell you about my Mother.
"If a 5′ tall 95 lb woman can solider on through all this tragedy, why can’t we all."
God Bless you Mom.
I miss you and I love you always.

Selecting specific columns in jpa 2 Criteria API?"
Is there a way to select specific column using the JPA 2 Criteria API?
"The following is the target SQL Statement:

With Hibernate's Criteria API this can be done using Projections, is there an equivalent to the JPA 2 Criteria Specification?"
"A:

Yes, it does."
The select() method is what you need to use.
"From the openJPA manual:

The select() method defines the result of the query."
"If left unspecified, the select projection is assumed to be the root domain object."
"However, you can specify the selected projections explicitly as a list: qdef.select(customer.get(Customer_.name), order.get(Order_.status));"

How to Remove Stuck Tape?
A DV tape has become stuck in my Canon Elura 100 camcorder.
"When I open the tape door, the motor whirls for a second, but doesn't move the tape holder up and out as it should."
I need to get the tape out without destroying the camcorder.
"A few questions:

(1) Any general suggestions to try that might help?"
(2) Any Elura 100 specific suggestions to try that might help?
"I've pulled a lot of screws out of this thing in an attempt to take it apart and access the tape, but so far no luck."
(3) Any suggestions of a CHEAP facility in Los Angeles that I could turn to for help?
Any idea how much it might cost?
"I'd prefer to do it myself, but can admit when I can go no further."
There's a spring in there to one side that if you remove will most likely allow the inner door to open.
Getting it to work after that depends on if anything got bent too badly.
Try to find a working one to see how it all goes together.
if you find an affordable repair place please post.
The normal pro shops charge more than is worth it for this priced cam.

Robert A. Fierro, hereinafter designated defendant, was convicted and sentenced to serve not less than ten nor more than twelve years in the Arizona state prison for the crime of robbery, in violation of A.R.S."
§§ 13-641 and 13-642.
"We granted defendant's application to file a delayed appeal pursuant to Rule 16(a), as amended, Rules of the Supreme Court, 17 A.R.S."
"The statement of facts on conviction, submitted by the Pima County Attorney and approved by the Superior Court of Pima County, set forth the following facts:
""On the 19th day of February, 1964 an Information was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the County of Pima charging Robert Fierro with the crime of Robbery committed on the 11th day of January, 1964."
"*119 ""On the 14th day of April, 1964 defendant entered a plea of not guilty."
"Trial was set, and on the 2nd day of June, 1964 defendant changed his plea to guilty."
"On the 17th day of June, 1964 in the Superior Court, the Honorable Lee Garrett presiding, defendant was sentenced to a term of 10 to 12 years in the Arizona State Prison."
"""The evidence showed that: The defendant, with an accomplice, drove up to the Circle K Foodstore at 6485 East Golf Links Rd., Tucson, Arizona, and entering the store pulled a revolver forcing manager Mike Lawless to give up money from the cash register."""
"The defendant, seventeen years of age at the time of commission of the crime, raises two assignments of error."
He first contends the trial court erroneously used information furnished by the Pima County Probation Office pertaining to defendant's juvenile record in determining the sentence to be imposed.
"In the record on appeal is a ""Pre Sentence Report"" compiled by the Pima County Probation Office which includes as a part thereof a copy of defendant's record from the Tucson Police Department listing some twenty-one instances in the period beginning September 21, 1957 through January 13, 1964 in which that department had some contact with defendant."
Defendant contends A.R.S.

B prohibits the use of such information by a trial court in determining a sentence.
"""A.R.S."

* * * * * *
""B."
"The disposition of a child or of evidence given in the juvenile court shall not be admissible as evidence against the child in any proceeding in another court, nor shall such disposition or evidence disqualify a child in a civil service application, examination or appointment."""
We do not have before us a transcript of proceedings at the time of sentencing.
We have no information as to what portion of the Tucson Police Department record in fact constitutes a juvenile court record in order to fall within the purview of the statute.
"Assuming, arguendo, some portion of the record does fall within its bounds and the trial court referred to the report, the issue thus presented is whether a defendant's record of juvenile offenses may be used by the trial court in determination of the sentence to be imposed."
The matter herein presented was before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth ex rel.
"Hendrickson v. Myers, 393 Pa. 224, 144 A.2d 367, where the court in interpreting a statutory provision almost identical to A.R.S."
"§ 8-228, subsec."
"B stated:
""* * * the sentence imposed in 1946 was illegal and void because the sentencing Judge was informed of and considered the appellant's Juvenile Court record in imposing sentence."
Appellant had been found delinquent when he was approximately 17 years of age as the result of a burglary then committed by him.
"Appellant contends that the use of said Juvenile Court record in the consideration of the aforesaid sentences was in violation of § 19 of the Act of June 2, 1933, P.L."
"1433, 11 P.S."
§ 261.
"Section 19 of that Act provides as follows: * * *""
""`* * * The disposition of a child or any evidence given in a juvenile court shall not be admissible as evidence against the child in any case or proceeding in any other court.'"
"""Generally speaking, there are several cogent reasons why juvenile records and evidence given in juvenile proceedings should not be used as evidence against a child in any case or proceeding in any other Court."
"Juvenile Court proceedings are normally informal, and many of the important constitutional and statutory guarantees afforded a defendant in a criminal trial do not apply to a juvenile in a hearing before a Juvenile Court."
"Holmes' Appeal, 379 Pa. 599, 109 A.2d 523."
"For these reasons, it would be unjust and illegal to allow the introduction of juvenile records or evidence given in *120 juvenile cases to be later introduced as competent evidence in criminal cases or proceedings in any other Court, in the same manner as criminal convictions or evidence taken in criminal proceedings may in certain instances be competent evidence in other criminal proceedings."
"""The statutory prohibition, however, was not transgressed by the lower Court."
"Section 19 does not prohibit the use of the `disposition of a child or any evidence given in a juvenile court' for any purpose; on the contrary, it bans the use of said order or evidence only when used `as evidence against the child in any case or proceeding in any other court'."
"Although the Legislature failed to define the word `evidence' in the statute, it is obvious that the Legislature used and intended to use `evidence' in its generally accepted meaning  testimony and matters actually presented at the trial."

""The Juvenile Court record was not introduced or presented as evidence in the trial."
"Moreover, the Juvenile Court record was not considered, even after the trial, to determine a factual issue, i.e., his guilt or innocence of the crimes with which he was charged; on the contrary, the juvenile record was taken into consideration by the trial Judge after the appellant had pleaded guilty and then only for the purpose of imposing a fair, proper and just sentence."

On the other hand the court has a responsibility to the law abiding citizens to protect them from young desperadoes who frequently are involved in the most violent and vicious of crimes.

"The ""Pre Sentence Report"" of the Pima County Probation office reaffirmed this position."
A boy who has been in prison from the time he was 17 years of age generally has not learned a trade or occupation.
"He is dependent upon what he has learned during his imprisonment, or what he may learn after his release, to prepare himself for a job in order to earn a livelihood."
He is forced to compete with those of his own age upon his release.
"Frequently, the longer the individual is kept in the penitentiary, the more difficult it is for him to compete."
"The greater the difficulty he encounters, the greater is his temptation to return to a life of crime."
"While it is one of the avowed purposes of our penal system to protect the public from criminals, we must recognize that rehabilitation of such offenders is also of primary importance."
"It is the feeling of this court that because defendant was only 17 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime, justice will be better served with a lesser minimum sentence, thus allowing the Pardon and Parole Board to examine defendant's case within a shorter period and parole him if it finds he has taken advantage of the rehabilitation facilities offered by our penal institution and that he has been rehabilitated to the extent that society may be better served by his release."
The conviction is affirmed and the sentence of defendant is hereby reduced to that of not less than five nor more than twelve years in the Arizona State Prison.
Judgment affirmed as modified.
"BERNSTEIN, V.C.J., and UDALL, J., concur."
"STRUCKMEYER, Chief Justice (dissenting in part):
I disapprove of the reduction of sentence but otherwise concur in the conviction."

"Introduction {#sec1}
===============

Breast cancer, the most common cancer in women worldwide, accounted for 1.7 million new cases in 2012, comprising a quarter of all new cancer cases \[[@B1]\]."
"While traditional risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history of cancer, and reproductive and menstrual history, the National Cancer Institute also recognizes overweight, lack of physical activity, and consumption of alcohol as risk factors \[[@B2]\]."
Several of these risk factors are associated with metabolic syndrome \[[@B3]\].
"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of pathophysiological disorders comprising central obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia."
"Reaven\'s definition of MS in 1988 \[[@B4]\] was followed by definitions from the World Health Organization \[[@B5]\], National Cholesterol Education Program\'s Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) \[[@B6]\], American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \[[@B7]\], and the International Diabetes Federation \[[@B8]\]."
The NCEP ATP III guidelines are the most commonly used criteria in the US \[[@B6]\].
"These criteria include the presence of three or more of the following \[[@B3]\]: abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 35 inches in women), triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) \< 50 mg/dL, blood pressure (BP) ≥ 130/85 mmHg, and fasting glucose ≥ 110 mg/dL."
"MS is estimated to be prevalent in at least a quarter of the adults in the Americas, in Europe, and in India \[[@B9]\]."
"MS has been identified as a risk factor for several cancers, particularly breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and prostate cancers \[[@B10]--[@B15]\]."
"Individual components of MS, for example, abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high BP, high triglycerides, and low HDL, are positively associated with the development of certain cancers, most notably breast cancer \[[@B16]--[@B27]\]."
"While studies show a positive association of breast cancer with diabetes \[[@B19], [@B28]--[@B33]\] and obesity \[[@B16], [@B34], [@B35]\], others show a negative association with obesity in premenopausal women \[[@B36]--[@B38]\]."
"Mixed results also characterize hypertension \[[@B22], [@B23], [@B39], [@B40]\] and dyslipidemia \[[@B22], [@B41], [@B42]\] as risk factors for breast cancer."
"In addition, although individual components of MS may not be strongly associated with the development of breast cancer, their combination may elevate the risk \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43]--[@B56]\]."
"For example, MS may activate different molecular pathways through endocrine, metabolic, and immune cell changes, which in turn influence breast tumorigenesis \[[@B47]\]."
"Such pathways that enhance breast cancer cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis include (1) increased levels of circulating estrogen, for example, estradiol \[[@B52], [@B54], [@B57]\], (2) higher levels of insulin \[[@B58], [@B59]\], (3) decreased level of circulating adiponectin \[[@B60]\], (4) increased plasma leptin concentration \[[@B60]\], and (5) increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha \[[@B61]\]."
Previous epidemiologic studies on MS and breast cancer risk show contrary results.
"For example, only four \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B51]\] of eight studies \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51], [@B62]--[@B64]\] reported a statistically significant association between MS and risk of breast cancer."
This might invite a conclusion that the association between MS and breast cancer risk is unknown.
"However, such an inference would be based on the vote-counting approach, an approach that ignores the magnitude of the association \[[@B65]\]."
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of MS and postmenopausal breast cancer found that MS was moderately associated with the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer \[[@B10]\].
"However, to the best of our knowledge, no meta-analytic research has addressed the conflicting results from individual studies of MS and breast cancer risk in all adult women."
"Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use the aggregate data meta-analytic approach to examine the association between MS and breast cancer risk in women."
2.
"Methods {#sec2}
==========

2.1."
"Study Eligibility {#sec2.1}
----------------------

The*a priori* inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) observational studies using cohort (both prospective and retrospective), case-control, or nested case-control study designs; (2) studies examining the association between MS (presence of a cluster of three or more metabolic abnormalities) and breast cancer incidence, as defined by the authors; (3) studies with adult females ≥ 18 years of age as participants; (4) English-language studies published as journal articles, doctoral dissertations, or masters\' theses; (5) published and indexed studies up to June 30, 2012; and (6) studies reporting sufficient data (e.g., rate ratios, risk ratios, odds ratios, standardized incidence ratios, hazard ratios, or frequencies) for calculating a common effect size."
Neither lobular carcinoma*in situ* nor ductal carcinoma*in situ* breast cancer cases were excluded from the study.
Studies not meeting all inclusion criteria were excluded from this review.
"Excluded studies were those that (1) were not published as full reports, such as conference abstracts and letters to the editors; (2) only examined individual components of MS; (3) measured the MS variables at time of cancer diagnosis; (4) used cancer mortality, rather than incidence, as the outcome; and (5) were published in a language other than English."
2.2.
"Data Sources {#sec2.2}
-----------------

A comprehensive and systematic search was conducted using four electronic databases: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and ProQuest (from their commencement to June 30, 2012)."
"Since the term MS dates back to the late 1950s, with variations in use as early as the 1920s, the start dates of each of the databases were used as the commencement date for study search: Web of Science (1900), CINAHL (1952), PubMed (1966), and ProQuest (1861)."
"In addition, cross-referencing from retrieved studies was also performed."
"Major keywords used in the search for potentially eligible studies included ""metabolic syndrome"" (""insulin resistance syndrome,"" ""syndrome x"") and ""breast cancer"" (""neoplasm and breast"")."
"Using the most recent publication, trials published as duplicate reports (parallel publications) were only included once."
All electronic searches were conducted using the graphical user interface for each database.
"The last search was conducted on June 30, 2012."
"An initial cut-off point for the inclusion of studies was not used given the difficulty in establishing such a point, as well as our concern about the potential loss of studies that met our eligibility criteria."
2.3.
"Study Selection {#sec2.3}
--------------------

At the first screening, one author (RB) screened all abstracts and selected articles for full-text examination."
"At the second level of the study selection process, two of the authors (RB and TH) examined the full-text articles and then selected the included studies following mutual discussion and consensus."
2.4.
"Data Extraction {#sec2.4}
--------------------

Two of the authors (RB and TH) reviewed every study selected and independently extracted data from studies onto electronic coding forms."
These forms could hold up to 52 items per study.
"Attempts were made to contact authors of three of the original studies for missing information \[[@B13], [@B62], [@B64]\], but only one provided the requested information \[[@B13]\]."
"After initial coding, the two coders (RB and TH) reviewed each item for agreement."
Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
"Using Cohen\'s kappa (*k*) statistic \[[@B66]\], the overall interrater agreement rate prior to correcting discrepant items was 0.96 for all included studies."
2.5.
"Risk of Bias Assessment {#sec2.5}
----------------------------

Risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist \[[@B67]\]."
"The items assessed included (1) study design, (2) adjustments for confounders, (3) selection of participants and their eligibility criteria, (4) measurement of predictor variables, (5) breast cancer diagnosis, (6) study size, (7) handling of missing data, and (8) reasons for nonparticipation of individuals at each stage of the study."
"A description of the criteria for risk of bias assessment is shown in [Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=""table""}."
"Two of the authors (RB and TH) conducted all assessments, independently of each other."
Disagreements were resolved through discussion.
No study was excluded based on the results of the risk of bias assessment.
2.6.
"Statistical Analysis {#sec2.6}
-------------------------

### 2.6.1."
"Calculation of Study-Level Effect Sizes {#sec2.6.1}

Risk estimates were used to examine the association between MS and risk of breast cancer."
"These were derived from reported relative risks, odds ratios, hazard ratios, incident rate ratios, or standardized incidence ratios, together with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), from the original studies."
"Where necessary and possible, all metrics were converted to risk ratios (RRs)."
Adjusted risk estimates were pooled for analysis from multivariable models in the original studies.
"However, for two case-control studies that were included \[[@B14], [@B51]\], adjusted odds ratios were used because of the lack of the requisite data to convert odds ratios to RRs."
### 2.6.2.
"Effect Size Pooling {#sec2.6.2}

All RR results were pooled using a random-effects model, an approach that incorporates between-study heterogeneity into the model \[[@B68]\]."
A *z*-score two-tailed alpha value ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
"In addition, 95% CIs were calculated for each result from each study as well as for pooled estimates."
Heterogeneity was calculated using the *Q* \[[@B69]\] and *I* ^2^ statistics \[[@B70]\].
An alpha level ≤ 0.10 for the *Q* statistic was considered to be evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity.
"While somewhat arbitrary, *I* ^2^ values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered to represent low, moderate, and high amounts of heterogeneity \[[@B70]\]."
Publication bias was assessed using the Trim and Fill approach of Duval and Tweedie \[[@B71]\].
"In addition, Rosenthal\'s Fail-Safe *N* test was used to compute the number of missing null studies that would be needed to nullify the overall pooled RR as being statistically significant \[[@B72]\]."
Statistically significant standardized residuals (*p* ≤ 0.05) were considered to be outliers.
### 2.6.3.
"Sensitivity Analyses {#sec2.6.3}

Influence analysis was conducted with each study result deleted from the model once, in order to examine the effects of each on the overall pooled results."
"Cumulative meta-analysis, ranked by year, was also conducted in order to examine the accumulation of results over time."
"A separate pooled analysis, limited to postmenopausal women, was conducted because studies show that MS in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51], [@B62]\]."
"In addition, pooled analyses were conducted with the following caveats*post hoc*: (1) deletion of results from two case-control studies because odds ratios were used instead of RR \[[@B14], [@B51]\], (2) deletion of results from studies that were not prospective cohort designs \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B51]\], and (3) limiting the results to studies that controlled for four or more of the important confounders (as listed in [Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=""table""}) \[[@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51]\]."
"Given the potential for diabetes and diabetes medications to affect breast cancer risk,*post hoc* data analysis was also conducted with studies that included participants with diabetes and/or taking medications for diabetes, deleted from the model \[[@B14], [@B43], [@B64]\]."
"All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, Version 2.2 \[[@B73]\]."

"Results {#sec3}
==========

3.1."
"Study Characteristics {#sec3.1}
--------------------------

[Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type=""fig""} presents a flow diagram of the selection of studies for the meta-analysis."
"Of the 291 studies screened, 47 (16.2%) were selected for full-text review: 25 from PubMed \[[@B14], [@B43]--[@B55], [@B64], [@B74]--[@B83]\], 17 from the Web of Science \[[@B13], [@B39], [@B63], [@B84]--[@B97]\], one from CINAHL \[[@B98]\], and four from ProQuest \[[@B62], [@B99]--[@B101]\]."
"Eight (17.0%) of the 47 studies that underwent a full-text review met the eligibility criteria \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51], [@B62]--[@B64]\]."
One article \[[@B14]\] presented results for two independent cohorts; thus each cohort was treated independently.
"A general description of the included studies is shown in [Table 2](#tab2){ref-type=""table""}."
Studies were published between 2008 and 2012 and from five different countries.
"The study designs included four prospective cohorts \[[@B48], [@B62]--[@B64]\], one retrospective cohort \[[@B13]\], one prospective nested case-control study \[[@B43]\], and two case-control studies \[[@B14], [@B51]\]."
"The baseline year for cohort inception ranged from 1983 to 2004, with average follow-up ranging between 2.7 and 13.5 years."
"Sample sizes ranged from 792 to 49,172 (total 97,277) adult females, excluding one study that did not report these data \[[@B64]\]."
The ages of the participants ranged from 21 to 86 years.
"Six studies conducted analyses on postmenopausal women \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51], [@B62]\]."
"The results of each cohort or case-control study were initially reported as a hazard ratio \[[@B13], [@B48], [@B63]\], incidence rate ratio \[[@B43], [@B62]\], standardized incidence ratio \[[@B64]\], or odds ratio \[[@B14], [@B51]\]."
"Methods for exposure assessment, cancer identification, and control of confounders varied across the eight included studies ([Table 3](#tab3){ref-type=""table""})."
"Seven studies identified the outcome (breast cancer) through histological reports or medical reports or from a cancer registry \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51], [@B62], [@B64]\], while one used self-report \[[@B63]\]."
"Only three studies examined invasive breast cancer cases \[[@B43], [@B48], [@B64]\]."
One study also reported on the*in situ* breast cancer cases but there were only seven such cases in that study \[[@B43]\].
"Another study analyzed all breast cancer cases (*in situ* and invasive) as well as invasive cancers separately, and results remained unchanged \[[@B48]\]."
3.2.
"Risk of Bias Assessment {#sec3.2}
----------------------------

Risk of bias results are shown in [Table 4](#tab4){ref-type=""table""}."
All of the studies were considered to be at low risk for selection of participants and meeting eligibility criteria in addition to providing adequately powered sample sizes.
"Out of eight studies, a majority were also considered low risk with respect to study design (six studies) and measurement of the outcome variable (seven studies)."
"In terms of handling potential confounders, half the studies were low risk, three were high risk, and one was unclear risk."
"Missing confounding variables included education, smoking status, alcohol use, family history of cancer, contraceptive use, or hormonal history."
"Similarly, half the studies had objective measurements of predictor variables, while the remainder relied on self-report, and were consequently considered high risk."
"Four studies deleted the participants with missing variables in their analyses (high risk), while two did not report how they handled missing data."
"Lastly, six studies were considered high risk because they did not report the reasons for nonparticipation of subjects at each stage of follow-up."
3.3.
"Statistical Analysis {#sec3.3}
-------------------------

### 3.3.1."
"Overall Results {#sec3.3.1}

Overall, a statistically significant increase of 47% in the risk for incident breast cancer was observed for adult females with MS (RR: 1.47, 95% CI, 1.15--1.87; *z* = 3.13; *p* \< 0.002; *Q* = 26.28, *p* \< 0.001; *I* ^2^ = 69.55%) ([Figure 2](#fig2){ref-type=""fig""})."
"With the exception of one study \[[@B63]\], all other studies had RR in the direction of increased risk \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51], [@B62], [@B64]\]."
"Funnel plot results for potential publication bias are shown in [Figure 3](#fig3){ref-type=""fig""}."
"Using the Trim and Fill approach that resulted in two imputations, the risk decreased by 16% but remained significant (RR: 1.31, 95% CI, 1.01--1.70)."
"The Fail-Safe N was 69, implying that 69 ""null"" studies would be needed to nullify the statistically significant association between MS and breast cancer risk in adult females."
No statistically significant outliers were identified (*p* = 0.06--0.82).
### 3.3.2.
"Sensitivity Analyses {#sec3.3.2}

With each study deleted from the model once, results remained positive and statistically significant ([Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type=""fig""})."
The pooled RR fell within a range of 20% (RR = 1.36--1.56) and none of the CIs for the point estimates was less than 1.0.
"Cumulative meta-analysis, ranked by year, revealed that results have been statistically significant since 2011 ([Figure 5](#fig5){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Deleting the two case-control studies from the model, the RR for incident breast cancer for women with MS decreased by 18% but was still statistically significant with moderate heterogeneity (RR: 1.29, 95% CI, 1.003--1.67; *z* = 1.98; *p* = 0.05; *Q* = 14.13, *p* = 0.01; *I* ^2^ = 64.61%)."
"When limited to studies with only prospective designs, the RR decreased by 30% but remained statistically significant with very low heterogeneity (RR: 1.17, 95% CI, 1.01--1.36; *z* = 2.04; *p* = 0.04; *Q* = 4.30, *p* = 0.37; *I* ^2^ = 7.04%)."
"When limited to postmenopausal women, breast cancer risk increased by 34% and was still statistically significant with high heterogeneity (RR: 1.81, 95% CI, 1.28--2.56; *z* = 3.37; *p* = 0.001; *Q* = 23.36, *p* = 0.001; *I* ^2^ = 74.32%)."
"When limiting the results to studies that controlled for four or more of the important confounders (as listed in [Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=""table""}) \[[@B14], [@B43], [@B48], [@B51]\], breast cancer risk increased by 17% and was statistically significant with moderate heterogeneity (RR: 1.64, 95% CI, 1.23--2.20; *z* = 3.34; *p* = 0.001; *Q* = 8.55, *p* = 0.07; *I* ^2^ = 53.21%)."
"Lastly, when data were analyzed after deleting from the model those studies that had participants with diabetes or taking medications for diabetes \[[@B14], [@B43], [@B64]\], the RR was slightly larger than the overall finding but the 95% CI included 1.0 (RR: 1.48, 95% CI, 0.92--2.4; *z* = 1.61; *p* = 0.11; *Q* = 17.4, *p* = 0.02; *I* ^2^ = 76.96%)."
4.
"Discussion {#sec4}
=============

The purpose of this aggregate data meta-analysis was to examine the association between MS and the risk for breast cancer in adult females."
"Overall, the results suggest that there was a modest positive association between MS and risk of breast cancer."
This finding is strengthened by the robustness of results from other analyses.
"These include (1) examination for publication bias, (2) influence analysis with each study being deleted from the model once, (3) deletion of the two case-control studies with odds ratios from the overall model, (4) limiting the analysis to prospective designs, (5) including only postmenopausal women in the analysis, and (6) limiting the results to studies that controlled for four or more of the important confounders."
"In addition, the results from cumulative meta-analysis, ranked by year, indicate an increasingly statistically significant association since 2011."
"In contrast, despite a slightly increased mean RR, overlapping CIs were observed when studies that included participants with diabetes or taking medications for diabetes were deleted from the model \[[@B14], [@B43], [@B64]\]."
"However, whether this reduced precision is the result of these specific characteristics or some other factors, for example, loss of power with a reduced number of studies, is not known."
"Assessment for risk of bias indicated that a majority of studies were at low risk regarding study design, cancer assessment, and sample size."
"However, a majority were at high risk or unclear risk in terms of handling of missing data and nonparticipation of subjects at each stage of follow-up."
It is suggested that future studies provide complete information on the handling of missing data and on the nonparticipation of subjects at each stage of follow-up.
"When limited to postmenopausal women, a stronger association between MS and breast cancer was observed."
This association was stronger in case-control and retrospective cohort study designs compared to prospective cohort study designs.
These findings concur with those from a recent meta-analysis on MS and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women \[[@B10]\].
"Several studies have shown that MS in this group increases the risk of breast cancer \[[@B43], [@B46], [@B102]\], suggesting that the etiology of breast cancer may differ among pre- and postmenopausal women."
There are several potential mechanisms linking MS with an increased risk of breast cancer.
"First, obese postmenopausal women produce higher levels of estrogens, which in turn increase the biologically available fraction of circulating estradiol by reducing plasma concentration of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) \[[@B103]\]."
"Low plasma SHBG levels are associated with insulin resistance \[[@B104], [@B105]\] and other components of MS \[[@B106], [@B107]\]."
"Second, adipose tissue produces two adipokines (cytokine-like factors), leptin and adiponectin, that affect breast cancer biology \[[@B108]\]."
"Higher plasma leptin levels are associated with obesity \[[@B54], [@B57], [@B109]\], insulin resistance \[[@B110], [@B111]\], and MS \[[@B112], [@B113]\]."
"Leptin stimulates human breast cancer cell lines, whereas adiponectin acts protectively, inhibiting the growth of these cell lines \[[@B57], [@B108], [@B114]\]."
Obesity is associated with reduced adiponectin levels \[[@B115]\].
"Third, insulin has been shown to have a mitogenic effect upon breast cancer cells*in vitro* through several mechanisms \[[@B57]\]."
It can act synergistically with estradiol and stimulate proliferation of the cell line \[[@B116]\].
"Insulin can also lower SHBG production \[[@B117]\], thereby increasing biologically available estradiol."
"Moreover, low serum HDL-C concentrations indicate higher circulating bioactive estrogen levels, which in turn may stimulate target breast tissue \[[@B77]\]."
"The increasing prevalence of MS and its association with breast cancer, among other comorbidities, point toward the critical need to develop public health strategies to manage MS."
"Given the increasingly large global burden of metabolic risk factors, even a small association with breast cancer can have a substantial public health impact."
Risk assessment tools can be developed which incorporate MS as a risk factor for breast cancer.
Healthcare providers will then be better equipped to identify high-risk women for primary and secondary prevention.
This study has several strengths.
"First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between MS and risk of breast cancer in all adult women."
The analysis incorporates all women and a subanalysis of postmenopausal women.
The overlapping meta-analysis on metabolic syndrome and breast cancer was confined to postmenopausal women only \[[@B10]\].
"Second, a number of other analyses were performed which strengthened the robustness of findings."
"Third, the results of this study provide direction for future research on this topic."
This study also has several potential limitations.
"These include (1) the different methods used to assess exposure, identify cancer, control for confounders, and define MS, (2) limiting studies to those published in English, which may have inflated the results \[[@B118]\], (3) the relatively small number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, (4) the inability of some studies to provide raw data for calculating the RR, (5) the different study designs employed, and (6) the varied populations studied, including those with diabetes and/or taking medications for diabetes."
"Most notably and with respect to controlling for adiposity, a potential confounder, two of the included studies controlled for BMI \[[@B48], [@B62]\] but no information was available from the other studies with respect to controlling for BMI or any other obesity-related measures, including such measures of central obesity as waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio \[[@B13], [@B14], [@B43], [@B51], [@B63], [@B64]\]."
"Given the potential association between breast cancer and adiposity, it may be prudent for future studies to control for this potential confounder."
This may be especially true for measures of central adiposity.
"To this point, Kabat et al."
"suggested that some, but not all, studies have reported an association between increased central adiposity and an increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer \[[@B48]\]."
Another limitation was a lack of information on tumor subtypes.
"The inclusion of such information in future studies may be important, given the potential differences in risk according to exposure and disease subtype."
"In order to inform and undergird a biological rationale for the observed positive association between MS and breast cancer risk in adult females, future research should comprise analyses based on a standard definition of MS and employ objective and standard biomarkers for assessing each MS component."
"In addition, adjustments for all important potential confounders need to be made."
It would be helpful if future studies examined the relationship between MS and breast cancer risk separately in perimenopausal and premenopausal women since breast cancer in women may be estrogen-independent.
"Along those lines, not all studies adjusted for hormone replacement therapy, a potential confounder."
Future studies should report this information.
"Furthermore, they need to examine*in situ* and invasive cancers separately in relation to metabolic syndrome."
"Finally, a focus on obese women with respect to MS and breast cancer seems appropriate."
"In conclusion, the overall results of this meta-analysis suggest that there is a modest positive association between MS and risk of breast cancer in adult females."

"To LISTEN to the audio short story, press PLAY>

."
"The other day, someone whom I adore made mention to someone else how, ‘they didn’t like cops’, because they get to do things the rest of us are not privileged to do only because they’re the law."
This common paradox within our society today intrigued me to the point of wanting to talk about it in a few insignificant and meaningless words.
"You know, I think I have said the same thing only because one or two cops, in my entire life, have caused me grief whether it was a ticket, ( I obviously did not deserve ), or some smart ass reply directed my way when I interfered with their presumably mundane day."
Shame on me for being so presumptuous.
Pretty petty now as I see it.
Pretty petty of me.
"After the Boston bombing and seeing the mountains of videos and photos of who was running toward their possible death and those running away, one photo in particular showing an officer, defensively positioned over a fallen elderly man, who was obviously in distress, and shielding him in a firm protective stance."
This photo made me now become something of a different man.
"I asked myself, ‘Which way would I run?’

We all want to say, ‘Of course, the heroic way.’ But would we?"
What if it meant your 10-year-old growing up without a Dad or Mom.
"What if it meant never to be able to say I love you to your wife, sister, brother, son, daughter, cousin, mom, dad, or even your dog?"
What if you had to decide all of this in a sliver of a moment?
"Would you run toward the fear, the impending doom or decide easily to run away to protect only yourself?"
"I’m not exactly sure anymore and if I was forced to say which way, I think and hope I would run toward the fear, not just because saying I would is the right thing to say."
"Although there was not any fear involved, I have in my life, run to car accidents, I’ve run to dying men who have had heart attacks on the dance floor of their daughter’s weddings, I’ve run to an old man who was dying from being kicked by a horse, I’ve run to co-workers who were injured in the middle of the night but now at my age I ask myself, ‘Would I run away, run far away from the possible mortality if I had to decide?’

You see, I have a family, I have many friends, I have a wonderful grand baby and a very special daughter, daughter-in-law and son, I have the best wife any man could ever dream of in life."
"So I ask, would they really miss me?"
"Would they after time had passed after I have passed, miss me?"
I truly think they would and most importantly need to ask myself; do I want to put them through the horrific depression that is the sum for someone else who is left behind?
"Answering that question is not as hard as what a cop, a fireman, a utility lineman or all the first responders who act for us, do everyday."
"Answering the call is nothing more than being significant, being selfless and having an inner core human desire of wanting and needing to help."
"Did you know, cops do it everyday?"
Here’s a matter of fact.
"Did you know in December of 2012, remember this is near the Christmas holidays, a cop without a second thought in Boston again, threw himself over a railing and fell into the freezing waters of Boston Harbor to rescue a woman who had fallen into the channel by accident."
"Accident or not, who really cares, he knew she needed help now?"
"“I heard everybody screaming, She’s in the water, she’s in the water,” said Keith Young, a UPS delivery driver who witnessed the dramatic rescue, “Then I saw the cop pull up."
"He jumped out, he ripped his jacket off, ran down the stairs, ripped off his duty belt and jumped into the water and went right to her."
I’ll tell you what.
The cop was a hero today.
"He didn’t think twice about it.”

Do you know what Officer Ed Norton said?"
“My buddies are who helped.” He was speaking of his fellow cops and fire guys who weren’t even there yet when he jumped.
The video shows us he had made the decision and was running toward the fear.
"Are you jumping into the freezing, breath-stealing water or are you standing on the warm bank of the sideline and just watch?"
Do you still not like cops?
"Did you know that only breaths before he was fatally wounded in an unprovoked attack, a San Diego police officer performed one last act of kindness as he bought a child some needed food while buying his own dinner of fast food to get him through his night shift."
"Officer Jeremy Henwood, 36, stopped at a McDonald’s around 5 o’clock on his day of significance on August 6th."
Store surveillance video showed Henwood speaking with a small boy and buying his food shortly before leaving the store at 5:30.
"Shortly after that, Henwood, I should call him by his first name, Jeremy, as that is who he was, was shot to death, point-blank with viciousness while sitting inside his patrol car at the corner of University Avenue and 45th Street."
"Jeremy had only made it six blocks from the McDonalds after enjoying a Big Mac or something from the fast food joint; it would be the last place he was seen alive, breathing, talking and being what we all want to be at least once in our life, significant."
Witnesses said an evil and cowardly man pulled up on his side of his cop car and shot him with a shotgun.
Massive wounds from such a violent attack ended any chances for him to have a future with those who he loved.
"Young Jeremy passed away at Scripps Mercy Hospital at exactly 1:42 a.m. on Aug. 7, because he was a cop."
What were you doing at that exact moment in your life?
I was probably not paying attention to anything and tucked in securely in my bed.
That’s it!
I like cops.
"Did you really know that the police officer who was wounded while chasing the Boston Marathon bombing suspects lost all of his own blood and, for 45 minutes, his own heartbeat, after being shot in the thigh."
Hey what the hell you might say because Doctors believe he will make a full recovery.
So what’s the big deal?
I’ll tell you what the big deal is.
"This Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Officer, named Richard Donohue Jr., 33, drove or ran toward the bombers and suffered a severed femoral vein during an exchange of fire with them."
He has a six-month old boy.
His boy doesn’t even know him yet.
That’s a big deal!
"Dic Donohue, was wounded early that Friday morning, when he raced to help MIT and Cambridge police as they chased the Boston Marathon bombing suspects to the corner of Dexter and Laurel streets in Watertown."
"No one knew whether Donohue knew then that his friend and MBTA academy classmate, Sean Collier, an MIT police officer, had been killed earlier, allegedly by the suspects he was now chasing."
"A shoot-out ensued, during which a bullet ripped through Dic’s right thigh, hitting both branches of the femoral artery and the femoral vein."
"The gunshot drained his and his family’s life out of them, one cup at a time."
So easy it would have been for him to ease off the pedal and lose the crazy Chechen terrorists and then go home.
Would I have slowed down?
I hope not.
A 2010 police academy graduation photo showing Sean Collier with his arm around Richard Donohue Jr. depicts a hopeful friendship.
How would they have known that the friendship would someday and forever be linked by a horrible tragedy.
Sean was sitting by himself when he died.
"He might have been typing something on the laptop, or just texting family that he loved them."
"Boston police say the Tsarnaev brothers ambushed him while he responded to a disturbance on the MIT campus late Thursday, three days after the deadly carnage at the Boston Marathon."
He was hit five or six times.
"His gun was still in the holster but earlier when it mattered, he went toward the danger."
Look closely at Sean’s eyes in this photo.
What do you see?
I see intense and overwhelming pride.
I’d want him to run my way if I needed him.
I’ll bet my entire life savings that he liked cops and he was only 26 years old.
C’mon!
"So now when you sit at home, in the warmth of your family life, with your loved ones around, or even by yourself, with your nice, secure and safe job or even an un-nice, insecure and unsafe job, as some of us have, think about this next time you’re here to kiss your children, your wife, your husband, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your friend, or your mom and dad and be able to just reach down and pet your dog because today, you know you don’t have to decide, in a moment of life or death, which way to run?"
"Then as you’re lounging comfortably on your easy chair, close your tired eyes and think about this."
"Think about buying someone a Big Mac just for the fun of buying a tasty and filling Big Mac, for anyone who might be hungry, just like Officer Jeremy did."
"And if this also comes to mind, ‘I don’t like cops.’

Then think again."
"The End

“The best part of life starts at the top of the stretch.”

"Laser treatment for psoriasis

I have mild psoriasis on my scalp and hairline."
I used ointments and creams and it goes away but when i stop using it again come back so i i'm looking for Laster treatment alternative.
I was curious if anyone here has done.
Will it be the same case as ointments ( coming back after stop using Laser) or it gets back to normal and will atleast won't come for few years or ever.
Any experience people here could help me.
The most rapid and single agent regimen is aggressive UVB phototherapy for clearing psoriasis.
There are different protocal for using either three times a week or five times or daily.
Atleast 18 treatments might require to see the clearance.
This involves application of lubricants to psoriatic plaques before therapy.
Another effective regimen would be Photochemotherapy for widespread severe psoriasis.
"Here a psoralen,a photoactive drug is taken orally followed by exposure to long-wave UVL after 2 hrs."
Long term side effects might include squamous cell carcinoma.
Psoralen plus PUVA is one of the most effective therapy.
Clearance of lesion might occur after successful treatment for about 15-20 exposure over 5-8 weeks.
But it might again re-occur after several months so countinuous therapy atleast once a month or twice exposure is required to get the complete benefit from it.
"Combined therapy with PUVA-UVB, Retinoid-PUVA,methotrexate-PUVA might be another effective therapy for clearing widespread psoriasis."
You should remember that longterm studies of safety and efficacy of these therapy is still in progress.
Please consult your dermatologist to discuss about this issue.
"Directions

Place the grapefruit mixture into an ice cream machine or a sorbet maker, and freeze according to the manufacturers directions."
Serve at once or transfer to a freezer container and freeze until ready to serve.
Place the sorbet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before serving to allow it to soften slightly.
"To serve, hollow out 2 grapefruit halves and divide half the strawberry slices evenly among the halves."
"Scoop the sorbet over the strawberries, then cover with the remaining berries."

Can anyone help me figure out why I keep getting this error?"
I've spent hours searching the net with no success.
"A:

The issue is in line -
list = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']

You are overwriting the in-built list function with your list , after this assignment , if you try to call list() it would cause error, as it would try to access the list you defined and call it."
"Use a different name, do not ever use list as a name for a variable (unless you really wanted to overwrite the list in-built function) , since it overwrites inbuilt functions."

"They also point out that the documents they divulged were hardly closely held state secrets, the “fundamental interests of the Holy See,” as the Vatican contends in the indictment."
"Reached by telephone on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Fittipaldi said he was “incredulous” that the Vatican was putting him on trial."
"“I didn’t reveal anything that put the life of the pope at risk,” he said."
"“Instead, the documents recount the financial scandals of the curia, crazy investments, greed."
"It seems strange that they would investigate the teller of those misdeeds rather than those who carried them out.”

Putting journalists on trial is a chilling message from the Vatican, the writers said."
"“They want to show that they are a state with laws that have to be respected even if we don’t like them,” even if they are undemocratic, Mr. Fittipaldi said."
“They want to make an example of this.
"It’s going to be more difficult for scandals of this type to emerge in the future,” because those who might want to expose corruption and mismanagement will be more wary."
Mr. Nuzzi remained defiant.
"“I am proud to have published information that was not supposed to get out, as any journalist would have done,” he said."
"“I didn’t reveal state secrets” involving internal military or security or intelligence issues, “but instances of dishonesty and abuse, and I will continue to do so.”

Questions of conflicting laws are likely to arise if the court convicts the two journalists and then asks for their extradition from Italy to begin serving their sentences, Mr. Fittipaldi said."
"Italy has laws protecting freedom of the press, even if the Vatican does not."
Both men said they were not certain that they would attend the hearings.
"Mr. Nuzzi also complained that with the trial date three days away, he would not have enough time to prepare his defense."
"“I haven’t had access to the charges or investigative acts, I haven’t spoken to my Vatican court-appointed lawyer, and I am still not sure what I’m being accused of,” he said."
"In light of the pope’s increasing appeals to the faithful to be more merciful in the holy year that begins on Dec. 8, “this trial would appear like a contradiction,” he said."
This paper presents a new method for producing a dictionary of subcategorization frames from unlabelled text corpora.
"It is shown that statistical filtering of the results of a finite state parser running on the output of a stochastic tagger produces high quality results, despite the error rates of the tagger and the parser."
"Further, it is argued that this method can be used to learn all subcategorization frames, whereas previous methods are not extensible to a general solution to the problem."
"Background {#Sec1}
==========

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious disease with a high mortality rate."
"Rhabdomyolysis is a common clinical disorder with a broad spectrum of traumatic and non-traumatic etiologies, and approximately 10 to 50% of patients suffering from rhabdomyolysis develop some degree of AKI \[[@CR1], [@CR2]\]."
Renal tubular damage is a pathological characteristic of AKI.
"Currently, animal models of glycerol-induced AKI are widely used \[[@CR3]\]."
"Glycerol injection into the muscle causes the release of myoglobin and other muscle contents into the circulation, ultimately resulting in AKI."
"Recent studies have demonstrated that the pathogenesis of glycerol-induced AKI involves myoglobin toxicity \[[@CR4]--[@CR6]\], reactive oxygen species (ROS) \[[@CR7]--[@CR9]\], inflammation \[[@CR10]\], apoptosis \[[@CR11], [@CR12]\] and redox-active iron \[[@CR7]\]."
"Although the pathogenesis of glycerol-induced AKI is complex, timely prophylactic and/or early therapeutic interventions can promote recovery \[[@CR8], [@CR12], [@CR13]\]."
"Anisodamine, derived from *Scopolia tangutica* Maxim, is used for the treatment of gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasm, infective toxic shock, myocardial infarction and acute lung injury in China \[[@CR14]--[@CR17]\]."
Anisodamine and atropine are non-specific cholinergic antagonists with the usual spectrum of pharmacological effects typical of this drug class.
"However, anisodamine appears to be less potent and less toxic than atropine, which is widely used in clinical and basic research \[[@CR18]\]."
Anisodamine has been shown to be effective in improving the microcirculation of the hydronephrotic kidney in the rat \[[@CR19]\].
No published report has examined the efficacy of delayed therapeutic intervention when renal dysfunction is already well established.
"In our previous study (data not published), anisodamine was effective in the treatment of AKI."
"However, the mechanisms by which anisodamine promotes recovery from renal dysfunction in the rat AKI model remain unclear, although they may involve the inhibition of apoptosis and the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production."
"In this study, we used the rat glycerol-induced acute renal injury model to clarify the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effectiveness of anisodamine."
We investigated the effects of the delayed administration of anisodamine on renal function and pathology by examining biomarkers of AKI.
"Our findings suggest that anisodamine improves renal function by affecting leukocyte infiltration and inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis."
"Materials and methods {#Sec2}
=====================

Animal groups, randomisation and tissue collection {#Sec3}
--------------------------------------------------

Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 8 weeks of age (190--210 g) were purchased from Hebei Medical University and housed in metabolic cages under standard conditions, with food and water available ad libitum, in a room with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 08:00 to 20:00 h) and controlled temperature (21 ± 1 °C)."
All procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Ethics and Use Committee of Hebei Science and Technical Bureau in the People's Republic of China.
The block randomisation scheme will be generated by a computer-generated random assignment sequence prepared in advance.
"First, the rats were labeled with codes of Arabic numerals in same cage (same genetic background)."
"In each cage, there will be labeled numerically with these codes, then the labeled codes were inputted into computer."
An independent statistician who is not directly participant in the conduct of the trial will generate the randomisation sequence with computer.
"The rats were fasted (food and water) for 24 h before glycerol injection, and then divided randomly into nine groups (see Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}) according to trial design with block randomization."
Group 1 (*n* = 5) was not given any treatment.
Groups 2--5 (*n* = 45) were given intramuscular injections of 50% glycerol (10 mL/kg) in their hind limbs.
"Groups 1 and 2 received sterile water, while group 3 received anisodamine (Raceanisodamine Hydrochloride Injection, Hangzhou Minsheng Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd.) by intraperitoneal injection (1 mg/kg) 20 min before the initial glycerol injection."
"Groups 4 and 5 each received atropine (atropine sulfate injection, Hangzhou Minsheng Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd.) by intraperitoneal injection (0.05 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) 20 min before the initial glycerol injection."
Groups 6--9 (*n* = 37) were given intramuscular injections of 50% glycerol (15 mL/kg) in their hind limbs.
"Group 6 received sterile water, while group 7 was given anisodamine by intraperitoneal injection (1 mg/kg) 20 min before the initial glycerol injection."
Groups 8 and 9 each received atropine by intraperitoneal injection (0.05 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) 20 min before the initial glycerol injection.
Rats were placed in metabolic cages for 24-h urine collections.
The animals were euthanized with 10% chloral hydrate (4.5 ml/kg).
"Blood and urine were collected at different time points for estimation of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and creatine kinase."
The kidneys were harvested (*n* ≥ 3 at each time point) for further analysis.
Part of each kidney was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution.
"The remaining tissue was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C.Table 1Group experiment123456789Glycerol (10 mL/kg)√√√√Glycerol (10 mL/kg)√√√√Sterile water√√√Anisodamine (1 mg/kg)√√Atropine (0.05 mg/kg)√√Atropine (2 mg/kg)√√

Sample size calculation and inclusion/exclusion criteria {#Sec4}
--------------------------------------------------------

This study is designed primarily to explore the mechanism of protective effect of anisodamine on glycerol-induced acute kidney injury in rats."
We will aim to collect experimental data as many rats as possible according to common animal experiment design groups (6--9 rats/ each group).
"Eighty-seven rats are divided nine groups, which would be able to give 95% confidence."
The data from this animal experiment will be used to refine sample size calculations for future randomized controlled trial.
"Rat are eligible for inclusion if they are as follows:Weight between 190 g and 210 gMale ratsSurvival rats after treatment

Exclusion criteria

Rats are excluded if they have one or more of the following:The weight less than 150 g or greater than 280 gThe dead rats after treatmentFemale rats

Assessment of renal function {#Sec5}
----------------------------

Renal function was monitored by measuring serum creatinine (Cat."
no.
"C011--2), blood urea nitrogen (Cat."
no.
C103--2) and creatine kinase (Cat.
no.
"A032) using assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Jiang Su, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions."
"Kidney histology {#Sec6}
----------------

Kidney tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and routinely processed for paraffin embedding."
"Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological assessment, and images were obtained with an Olympus DP70 digital camera (Olympus Optical Co, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with Image-Pro Plus 6.0 Software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA)."
"The changes were limited to the tubulointerstitial areas, and were graded as follows (described previously in \[[@CR20], [@CR21]\]): (I) areas of tubular epithelial cell swelling, vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and desquamation involving \< 25% of cortical tubules; (II) similar changes involving \> 25% but \< 50% of cortical tubules; (III) similar changes involving \> 50% but \< 75% of cortical tubules; (IV) similar changes involving \> 75% of cortical tubules."
"Immunohistochemistry and evaluation of immunostaining {#Sec7}
-----------------------------------------------------

All incubations were carried out at room temperature, unless otherwise stated."
"Immunohistochemistry was conducted for KIM-1 (ab78494, Abcam), caspase-3 (\#9662, Cell Signaling Technology), cleaved caspase 3 (\#9664, Cell signaling Technology), RIP3 (ab62344, Abcam) and CD45 (bs-4819R, Bioss) in longitudinal sections of the kidney at the different time points."
"Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized and re-hydrated in water, and then immersed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0; 95 °C for 15 min) for antigen retrieval."
Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by immersion in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min.
"Thereafter, the sections were blocked with 5% goat serum or 1% BSA in TBS."
"Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, and then with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zhongshan, Beijing, China) for 30 min at room temperature."
"The sections were developed with 3,3′ diaminobenzidine solution."
"Negative control slides were treated in the same manner, but incubated with an isotype-matched non-specific immunoglobulin."
Digital images of the sections were captured and evaluated in a blind manner.
All sections were evaluated for the percentage of positive cells and labeling intensity.
"The percentages of positive cells were assigned scores as follows: 1, \< 5%; 2, 5--25%; 3, 21--50%; 4, 50--75%."
"The intensity was scored as follows: 0, negative staining; 1, weak staining; 2, intermediate staining; 3, strong staining."
"The score was calculated by multiplying the percentage of positive cells (1--4) by the staining intensity (0--3), to obtain a value of 0--12."
Cells were counted under a 40× objective.
"Determination of MDA levels and SOD&IL-6 activity {#Sec8}
-------------------------------------------------

Kidney tissue was gently homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C."
The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute).
"The supernatant was then used for the determination of MDA levels (A003, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), SOD activity (A001, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) and IL-6 activity (PI328, Beyotime) using kits according to the supplier's instructions."
"Western blotting {#Sec9}

Observation of kidney morphology after glycerol/anisodamine/atropine treatment {#Sec12}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Histopathological analysis of kidney tissue was performed after glycerol administration."
As shown in Fig.
"[1](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}, at 0 h, the morphology of renal tissues was normal, with the inner part of the organ appearing soft and reddish in longitudinal sections in the control group."
"Pathological changes gradually increased in the AKI group from 3 to 72 h, including tubular epithelial cell swelling, vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and desquamation."
"At 24 h, the epithelial cells showed desquamation and necrosis, and a number of protein casts and exfoliated tubular epithelial cells were visible in the proximal and distal tubules."
These changes were classified as grade IV.
"At 48 h, the renal capsular space widened."
The epithelial cell debris appeared desquamated and disseminated into the tubular lumen.
Cast formations could be also seen in the distal tubules.
These changed were classified as grade III.
"At 72 h, the protein casts in the tubular lumens gradually dissolved and disappeared, and regenerating epithelial cells could be seen intermittently at the sites of injury in the tubules.Fig."

As shown in Fig.
"[2](#Fig2){ref-type=""fig""}a, kidneys in the untreated group were dark pink in color, which indicated that the organs were healthy."
"In comparison, in the glycerol treatment group, the kidneys were dark red and covered with white spots, suggesting that the organs were unhealthy."
"Kidneys in the anisodamine and atropine treatment group were light brown in color and sparsely covered with white spots, indicating that they were also injured."
The kidney in the anisodamine treatment group appeared to have a slightly darker shade than that in the atropine group (Fig.

Discussion {#Sec19}
==========

In the present study, we demonstrated that anisodamine ameliorates renal damage possibly by regulating tubular leukocyte infiltration, by inhibiting apoptosis or necroptosis, and by decreasing the levels of oxidative stress."
"Our findings are consistent with previous studies in which oxidative stress injury, renal tubular apoptosis and systemic or local inflammation have been implicated in glycerol-induced renal dysfunction \[[@CR10]--[@CR12], [@CR28]\]."
"Furthermore, anisodamine treatment was more effective than atropine treatment for glycerol-induced AKI, although they are both anti-muscarinic drugs exhibiting the usual spectrum of pharmacological effects of this drug class."
"In most studies, AKI is induced by intramuscular injection of 50% glycerol (10 mL/kg) in the hind limb."
This dose of glycerol is non-lethal in most rats.
"In comparison, 50% glycerol at 15 mL/kg can result in death."
"However, the cause of death was not examined in this study."
The rats only showed periods of oliguria and mania-like symptoms.
"Treatment with anisodamine reduced the mortality rate, perhaps by improving intrarenal blood flow or by protecting against myocyte injury \[[@CR1]\]; however, the mechanisms remain unclear."
"Atropine, a centrally-acting muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, may have different functions at different doses."
"In a study of neurons in the subfornical organ, atropine had an antagonistic action on muscarinic responses at low concentrations (0.01--1 μM), while it suppressed GABAergic synaptic transmission at high concentrations (10 μM to 1 mM) \[[@CR29]\]."
"Therefore, we investigated the effect of a therapeutic dose of atropine on glycerol-induced kidney dysfunction."
"The high-dose group received 2 mg/kg of atropine, whereas the low-dose group received 0.05 mg/kg of atropine."
"We found that both doses of atropine had a modest effect on mortality rate in rats with glycerol-induced AKI, with no significant difference between the high-dose and low-dose groups."
"Anisodamine also exhibits antioxidant activity, and its therapeutic effectiveness has been demonstrated in cardiac arrest and myocardial dysfunction \[[@CR30], [@CR31]\]."
Previous studies have suggested that ROS-induced oxidative stress is an important mechanism in the initiation and maintenance of glycerol-induced AKI \[[@CR30]--[@CR32]\].
"To assess the effect of anisodamine on redox status, we measured MDA levels and SOD activity in renal tissues."
The increased SOD activity and decreased MDA levels suggest that anisodamine protects against early AKI by reducing ROS-induced oxidative stress and by enhancing endogenous antioxidant defense capacity.
"As oxidative stress is directly involved in the pathogenesis of early AKI, it can also result in mitochondrial-related apoptosis and exacerbate renal dysfunction \[[@CR32], [@CR33]\]."
"Therefore, we measured levels of a key apoptotic protein, caspase-3/cleaved caspase-3, to assess apoptotic cell death."
"Although the protective effect of anisodamine against myocardial cell apoptosis has been demonstrated in pigs, its effect on apoptosis in glycerol-induced AKI remained unknown."
"Cells in the distal portion of the proximal tubule undergo both apoptosis and necrosis in AKI \[[@CR34], [@CR35]\]."
"Here, we found that both RIP3 and caspase-3 are localized to the membranes of damaged proximal tubular epithelial cells undergoing desquamation and necrosis, although the relationship between apoptosis and necroptosis in glycerol-induced AKI in these experiments remains unclear."
"After treatment with anisodamine, renal function and pathological changes were significantly improved, suggesting that necroptosis mediated by RIP3 participates in the loss of renal cells and may be an important cause of AKI."
"KIM-1, a biomarker of kidney injury that is localized to damaged epithelial cells in the renal proximal tubule, was continuously expressed during the processes of kidney injury and recovery after AKI \[[@CR36]\]."
"We observed that the expression of KIM-1 quickly increased (at 3 h) after the glycerol injection (data not shown), and was highly increased and sustained from 24 to 72 h. Although anisodamine and atropine both significantly decreased the expression of KIM-1 at the 24 h time point, anisodamine was much more effective in decreasing KIM-1 levels than atropine."
"A pro-inflammatory response and leukocyte infiltration are typical pathophysiological characteristics of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI, which may impair cellular functions and lead to tubular epithelial cell swelling, apoptosis, desquamation and repair \[[@CR37]--[@CR40]\]."
"We observed that IL-6 and CD45 levels were reduced by both anisodamine and atropine, with no significant difference between these drugs."
"We also found that anisodamine decreased leukocyte infiltration and protected against renal dysfunction, consistent with previous studies showing that macrophage infiltration is linked to renal dysfunction in AKI \[[@CR39], [@CR41]\]."
"In summary, we demonstrated that anisodamine promotes renal recovery in the rat model of glycerol-induced AKI."
"Anisodamine inhibited delayed apoptosis, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress in renal tubular epithelial cells."
"Although the mechanisms underlying the nephroprotective action of anisodamine remain unclear, our findings suggest that the drug may have therapeutic potential for rhabdomyolysis-induced and other forms of AKI."
"Conclusions {#Sec20}
===========

We used the acute renal injury model induced by glycerol which leads to rhabdomyolysis to study the mechanism of prevention by anisodamine."
Effects of the delayed administration of anisodamine on renal function and pathology in a rat model of glycerol-induced AKI were examined.
"We uncovered some non-M-receptor-mediated mechanisms underlying glycerol-induced AKI and described the effects of anisodamine on predictive biomarkers of AKI, signaling involved in leukocyte infiltration and inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis."
"Retreatment by anisodamine ameliorated renal dysfunction in glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammatory response and apoptosis (necrosis)."
Further studies are needed to prospectively explore mechanism of apoptosis of renal epithelial cells presumably involved in transport of membrane protein such as megalin or lysosome-related apoptosis due to excessive intake of myohemoglobin.

Prevalence of cytomegalovirus retinitis in Tanzanians with low CD4 levels.
To determine the prevalence of cytomegalovirus virus (CMV) retinopathy among a consecutive group of Tanzanians with AIDS with CD4 count <100 cells/μl.
Patients with HIV infection with CD4 count <100 cells/μl presenting consecutively to infectious disease services at two hospitals were examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy with fully dilated pupils.
Additional clinical information was collected by interview and from patient files.
"One-hundred and fifty patients with CD4 count <100 cells/μl were examined, of whom 74 had CD4 count <50 cells/μl; 129 patients (86%) were classified as WHO stage 3 or 4."
Only two patients (1.3%; 95% CI 0 to 2.3%) had CMV retinitis.
"This study demonstrates that AIDS patients in Tanzania do survive into the stage of severe immunosuppression, and that even among this group CMV retinitis is very uncommon."
This supports previous studies reporting low prevalence of CMV where CD4 counts were not available.
Differences in immune response in AIDS patients in different settings may depend on environmental exposure to specific viruses early in life.

"The Adventurists provide some expert advice on where the best riding will be found, including help at getting across Lake Baikal as well as the forest trails and rural ice roads around the lake."
"There will be Russian vodka-fuelled parties under the stars, Banyas (a Russian sauna, a kind of steam bath), fires and feasts of local fish, thrown into the mix during the 12-day event."
"But the most fun comes in the form of dealing with the lake’s 12,000 square miles of ice."
"Whilst the wind can polish the ice smooth and flat like a mirror, in more sheltered areas it can resemble a freshly ploughed field, with great tombstones of ice to navigate around."
If the winter is mild there will be surface water and cracks to pick a path through and sometimes jump over.
"One thing you can count on, the route across the lake certainly won’t be in a straight line!"
“We made some rash decisions.
I remember going across one particular crack and not really thinking about stopping.
The back wheel went through the ice.
"We had enough momentum to pull through, but it was a bit of an eye-opener.”—Richard Fleming, 2015 competitor

“When you put the brakes on, not much happens except the bike pulls really hard to the right."
"Then the steering goes funny, the brakes lock up and you skid at a strange angle, usually straight into whatever it is you’re trying to avoid.”—Katy Willings, Ice Run Chief

“I’ve been all over the place on crappy vehicles that breakdown all the time, but it’s never really been a problem because whenever you stop you don’t feel like you’re going to fall through the road.”—Matt Prior, 2015 participant

If this sounds like your cup of tea, but you’re a little concerned about the fact you’ve not ridden a bike across a giant frozen lake before, you can be partly reassured by the fact there’s three days of rolling training and mechanical briefing, so you’ll get to know the basics of how to ride and fix a Ural motorcycle in -20oC, how to camp in the cold and how to pull someone out of the ice."
"If something does go drastically wrong, The Adventurists invisible backup crew are only a call away with a team of bike and adventure experts on hand."
"“Adventurists teams have raised millions for charity and by supporting Cool Earth (CoolEarth.org), you’ll be saving the world one rainforest at a time."
"Not because we’re tree hugging sandal weavers, but because the world would be shit without them.”

The Bikes

“What can I say about the Ural?"
"They are shit, but magnificent at the same time.”

These days Ural makes excellent bikes."
Thankfully that was not always the case and scattered across the corners of the ex-Soviet empire lie scores of old school Urals.
"They’re built like a tank, slightly rusty and often unreliable."
"Obviously, the all-round perfect Siberian adventuring machine for facing over 2,000 km of frozen rivers, lakes and roads at -20oC."
In 1939 the Russian army thought it was high time they had some motorbikes.
"Ever the masters of efficiency they nicked one from the Germans—the BMW R71—pulled it apart, copied it (badly) and slapped a Ural badge on it."
"Thus, was born one of the world’s coolest motorised bicycle machines."
Right up until the 2000s the design remained pretty much unchanged.
It is these old engineering marvels that The Adventurists have carefully selected to make sure completing the Ice Run is much more difficult than necessary.

"Q:

Minimal collection of subsets to reconstruct singletons

I have come across the following problem in a technical application."
"For a given integer $n$, what is the minimal collection of subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ such that all ""singleton"" sets $\{1\}, \{2\}, \dots, \{n\}$ can be ""reconstructed"" by set operations (intersection, union, set difference, complement) on those subsets?"
"For example, with $n = 5$ a possible collection is $S_1 = \{1,2,3\}, S_2 = \{2,3,4\}, S_3 = \{3,4,5\}$, because we can write
$$ \{1\} = S_1 \setminus S_2 \\
\{2\} = S_2 \setminus S_3 \\
\{3\} = S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3 \\
\{4\} = S_2 \setminus S_1 \\
\{5\} = S_3 \setminus S_2$$
In believe that in general, the sets $S_k = \{k,k+1,\dots,k+c-1\}$, $1\le k \le n-c+1$ and $c = \lceil n / 2 \rceil $ are sufficient, but I am not convinced they are minimal."
I am sure this problem has been studied in some context but I am not a professional mathematician and I don't even know where to look ... Any help appreciated!
"A:

It turns out you can get by with only $\lceil \lg n\rceil$ sets, where $\lg$ as usual denotes logarithm base $2$."
I'll give a construction and prove that it is optimal.
"Note that you can construct all singletons with set operations if and only if you can construct all subsets of $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$; it can be useful to think of the latter as an equivalent goal."
"For each $i\ge 0$, let $S_i$ be the subset of $[n-1]$ whose binary expansions contain a $1$ in the $i$-th position."
"(We don't need to include $n$ in any of our sets; it's unnecessary, since the union of the $S_i$'s is $[n-1]$, so we can get the singleton $\{n\}$ by complementing.)"
"So $S_i$ is nonempty precisely when $n-1\ge 2^i$, i.e."
$i<\lg n$.
"Thus the nonempty $S_i$'s are indexed from $0,\ldots \lceil \lg n\rceil-1$."
"It's easy to see how to get any singleton $\{k\}$ from the $S_i$'s: look at the binary expansion of $k$; if the $i$-th bit of $k$ is $1$ then $k\in S_i$, otherwise $k\in \bar{S_i}$."
Intersecting the appropriate sets for each $i$ leaves the singleton $k$.
The fact that this construction is optimal follows immediately from the fact that the free Boolean algebra generated by $m$ elements contains $2^{2^m}$ elements.
"In a little more detail: the collection of all subsets of a given set forms a so-called Boolean algebra, under the correspondence $\wedge\leftrightarrow\cup$, $\vee\leftrightarrow\cap$, and $\neg\leftrightarrow\textrm{complement}$."
"Roughly, the free Boolean algebra $FA(m)$ on $m$ generators is the ""largest"" Boolean algebra that can be generated from the generators; the elements of $FA(m)$ are all of the non-equivalent Boolean expressions which can be formed from the given $m$ elements."
It is a standard result that $|FA(m)|=2^{2^m}$.
"Any Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}$ which can be generated by $m$ elements is a quotient of $FA(m)$, so in particular $\mathcal{A}$ can't have any more than $2^{2^m}$ elements."
"To sum up, if $m$ subsets of $[n]$ can generate all subsets via set operations, then we must have $2^{2^m}\ge 2^n$, i.e."
$m\ge \lceil\lg n\rceil$.
The given construction achieves this bound.
You can turn this into a nice card trick.
"Have someone think of a card, deal the deck into two piles, ask them which pile the card is in, pick up the cards and repeat 5 more times."
Then you can guess their card.
"The point is that, at the $i$-th stage, the two piles correspond to the sets $S_i$ and $\bar{S_i}$."
"Q:

File exceeds upload_max_filesize, despite max filesize being large enough

I am trying to upload a 762KB picture using the multi-file uploader at /wp-admin/media-new.php."

"By Britt Ghiroli

The Orioles have three finalists for the Rawlings Gold Glove Awards announced on Thursday morning, with shortstop J.J. Hardy, center fielder Adam Jones and right fielder Nick Markakis all honored in their respective American League categories."
"The awards, created in 1957, are determined by a survey a player and managers — which make up 75 percent — and the Society for Sabermetric Reasearch accounts for the other 25 percent."
The winners will be revealed during special award show on ESPN 2 on November 4 at 7 p.m ET.
"Baltimore, which has won an AL-best 67 Gold Gloves since the award’s inception, had six finalists last season and is well represented once again."
"Hardy is vying for his third consecutive Gold Glove win, while Jones is trying for his fourth career award."
Markakis won a Gold Glove in 2011.
Hardy is up against Kansas City’s Alcides Escobar and Chicago’s Alexei Ramirez.
"Boston’s Jackie Bradley, Jr. and Chicago’s Adam Eaton were nominated along with Jones among centerfielders, while Markakis will go head-to-head with Tampa Bay’s Kevin Kiermaier and Angels’ outfielder Kole Calhoun."

Replication Protein A 3 Is Associated with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Tumorigenesis and Poor Patient Survival.
"Replication protein A (RPA) 3 is a subunit of the RPA protein complex, which functions in multiple processes of DNA metabolism."
Dysregulation of RPA1 and RPA2 has been implicated in tumor progression in several cancer types.
"However, the function of RPA3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis has not been elucidated."
"In this study, we investigated the function of RPA3 in HCC development by stably knocking down its expression using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in HepG2 cell line, followed by cell proliferation, colony formation, soft agar, and invasion assays."
Xenograft experiment was performed to examine in vivo tumor-promoting properties of RPA3.
"Downregulation of RPA3-inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, soft agar growth as well as invasion in HepG2 cells were observed."
Stable knockdown of RPA3 significantly inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model.
"In addition, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that RPA3 was upregulated in human HCC tissues compared with matched noncancerous adjacent tissues (NATs)."
High expression of RPA3 was associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival.
Elevated expression of RPA3 promotes tumor progression in HCC cells.
RPA3 is upregulated in HCC tissues and high expression of RPA3 is associated with poorer patient survival.
"Therefore, this protein may represent a novel therapeutic target for intervention of HCC and prognostic biomarker for patient survival."
"A method and device as described above are known from NL-A-9301238, which describes the removal of bone from meat of a complete poultry leg."
"In this case, the area around the tarsal joint is clamped, and an incision is made around the drumstick in the vicinity of the tarsal joint in such a manner that the bone is reached."
"In a subsequent operation, the meat on the drumstick is pulled apart or stripped off the drumstick bone with the aid of a stripper mechanism."
"After a drumstick tendon has been severed in the vicinity of the knee joint, the meat is stripped off further in the vicinity of the knee joint, after which a thigh tendon is severed in the vicinity of the knee joint."
"Then, the thigh meat is stripped off the thigh bone and separated from the leg."
"The known operation of removing bone from meat of an entire poultry leg takes place in a bone-removal device having a number of processing stations, in each of which at least one of the separate operations is carried out on the leg."
The legs are supplied resting freely on a conveyor to a table and are hung in a clamping-head mechanism by an operator.
"The clamping head can move over the table, the latter subsequently being displaced between the various processing stations located above the table."
"During the processing in each processing station, the clamping head is stationary and cutting and meat-stripping tools are moved towards and away from the leg."
The resultant meat which has been separated from the bone is discharged using a second conveyor.
One drawback of the known bone removal is that the operations provided for this purpose take place in an independent bone-removal device to which loose legs have to be supplied in an arbitrary orientation.
"Since the legs, prior to the bone removal, are generally situated in a conveyor of a slaughter line which is also used in earlier operations, such as halving the body of the bird and separating the legs from the body of the bird, transferring the legs from this conveyor to the conveyor of the bone-removal device requires certain logistic features, and hanging the legs in the clamping-head mechanisms of the bone-removal device requires the use of at least one operator, which facts increase costs and reduce the reliability of the bone-removal process."
Illustration: Matt Golding Credit: The report was extremely critical of the way in which the $100 million in sporting grants was awarded by McKenzie ahead of last year’s election campaign.
It found successful applications were “not those that had been assessed as the most meritorious” and that there was “distributional bias” in the way projects were approved.
The problem is many of the grants were awarded to bodies within marginal seats or seats the Coalition wanted to win.
This is a serious matter because it represents a politicisation of a grant system which is supposed to be undertaken on merit.
The fact the Audit Office has made this finding is important.
But what happens now and what will the consequences be?
Will there be an investigation?
"If so, by whom?"
"Importantly, the Audit Office is an independent body."
"In the absence of a federal integrity commission, it has a significant role to play in ensuring government funds are spent for proper purposes."
A central part of the role of the Audit Office is to uncover and report on fraud and corruption in government decisions.
But it does not have coercive powers and its report does not have any direct legal effect on McKenzie.
"If there is to be a further investigation of this matter, it’s likely to be taken up by a parliamentary forum such as Senate Estimates."
What is more significant are the consequences of the Audit report.
"Warringah MP Zali Steggall says the politicisation of a $100 million community sports grant program overseen by Bridget McKenzie is ""disgusting""."
Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The first point to understand is that the direct legal consequences of the Audit Office finding are minimal.
The report made four recommendations for future reform of the sporting grant procedure.
"While the Audit Office is very well regarded by decision makers and commands respect, it is not a court."
Therefore its recommendations are not binding and can be ignored by government.
What is more significant are the legal implications of the Audit report.
Illustration: Andrew Dyson.
"Here, the problem is the Audit Office found the minister did not have legal authority to approve the grants in the first place."
This is because the legal power to approve the sporting grants is actually given to Sport Australia (under the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989).
That legislation says the minister can give written directions to Sport Australia in relation to the exercise of its powers.
But McKenzie actually made the decisions on the grants (rather than merely give written directions to Sport Australia).
"This is, however, somewhat of a theoretical argument as it is unlikely anyone will be able to bring this matter to court to invalidate the grant decisions made."
"Given community sporting groups who were disadvantaged by the improper grant process are community groups in need of funding, it’s unlikely they will be in a position to bring an expensive legal action."
It’s therefore likely the consequences of this report will be political rather than legal.
"Loading Here the political convention of “ministerial responsibility” should, ideally, come into play."
This gives effect to the broader principle that the Australian people give authority and power to elected politicians and those politicians must be accountable for their actions.
This means McKenzie could be asked to resign.
"However, the Senator has indicated she will not resign, saying “no rules were broken” and she was given discretionary powers “for a purpose” in the program’s guidelines."
"'The Audit Office of Australia is a respected, independent institution and its findings should have consequences.'"
And this is one of the problems with ministerial responsibility today: it largely depends on whether the relevant party feel it’s politically necessary to pressure the relevant minister to stand down.
"Loading The current strength of this principle in modern Australia has been questioned, with many saying it’s no longer effective."
"Journalist Tony Wright wrote in 2019: ""Ministerial responsibility in Canberra appears to have all but decayed to no responsibility."""
"So, there may be no political consequences in this matter at all."
"The Audit Office of Australia is a respected, independent institution and its findings this week should have consequences."
"Trust in government, which should be central to a healthy democracy, is at a historical low in Australia."
Governments need to make decisions which are transparent and fair.
A government that bends the rules is a danger to the rule of law and to democracy.
"Q:

Why is MsiGetFeatureState() returning INSTALLSTATE_ADVERTISED for my un-advertisible feature?"
"I've got an MSI built in WiX defined as below:
<Feature Id=""Core""
         Display=""0""
         Absent=""disallow""
         ConfigurableDirectory=""INSTALLDIR""
         AllowAdvertise=""no""
         Level=""1"">...</Feature>

I have a 'commit' custom action that loops through all the features of the MSI and determines their install-state."
"The log file shows this ""Core"" feature as installed 'Local', but MsiGetFeatureState returns INSTALLSTATE_ADVERTISED."
"I thought that was impossible given I set: 
AllowAdvertise=""no""

FWIW, MsiGetFeatureState correctly returns INSTALLSTATE_LOCAL for all other installed features and INSTALLSTATE_ABSENT for all other not-installed features."
"Edit for more info:

This occurs during a fresh install."
"I do not set the ADVERTISE property (I still don't fully understand what it's for)
The ""Core"" feature is a parent feature with children that all have the wix attribute InstallDefault=""followParent""."
"The ""Core"" feature (as well as its children) all have components attached to them."
All the child features are marked as INSTALLSTATE_ADVERTISED as well.
I have a commit custom action (scheduled before InstallFinalize) that queries the installed feature states ([ProductCode] is passed in via CustomActionData).
I assumed that a commit action was the right choice since the MSI is officially installed by that point.
"A:

Found out what the problem was (I think)."
I had a custom action that would call MsiSetComponentState() to set a component to INSTALLSTATE_ABSENT if some condition was true.
"This means that my 'Core' feature was intended to have every attached component set to INSTALLSTATE_LOCAL, but since this one component was manually forced into INSTALLSTATE_ABSENT the 'Core' feature (once installed) is considered to have an install state of 'Advertised'."
An additional consequence was that during uninstall all components attached to the 'Core' feature were getting left behind.
Their action states were NULL (do nothing) instead of Absent (remove).
"Moral of the story, don't use MsiSetComponentState() to turn off a component at install time."
Coupling factor F1 ATPase with defective beta subunit from a mutant of Escherichia coli.
The defective coupling factor F1 ATPase from a mutant strain (KF11) of Escherichia coli was purified to a practically homogeneous form.
"The final specific activity of Mg2+-ATPase was 6-9 units/mg protein, which is about 10-15 times lower than that of F1 ATPase from the wild-type strain."
"The mutant F1 had a ratio of Ca2+-ATPase to Mg2+-ATPase of about 3.5, whereas the wild-type F1 had ratio of about 0.8."
"The mutant F1 was more unstable than wild-type F1: on storage at -80 degrees C for 2 weeks, about 80% of its activity (dependent on Ca2+ or Mg2+) was lost, whereas none of the activity of the wild-type F1 was lost."
The following results indicate that the mutation is in the beta subunit.
(i) High Mg2+-ATPase activity (about 20 units/mg protein) was reconstituted when the beta subunit from wild type F1 was added to dissociated mutant F1 and the mixture was dialyzed against buffer containing ATP and Mg2+.
(ii) Low ATPase activity having the same ratio of Ca2+-ATPase to Mg2+-ATPase as the mutant F1 was reconstituted when a mixture of the beta subunit from the mutant F1 and the alpha and gamma subunits from wild-type F1 was dialyzed against the same buffer.
(iii) Tryptic peptide analysis of the beta subunit of the mutant showed a difference in a single peptide compared with the wild-type strain.

"Q:

How to position an ImageView in the same place in different screen sizes?"
"I been working on a simple android app that calculates a person's Body Mass Index, I have all the features working but positioning the arrow in the right place in the color bar corresponding to the user's screen size is what Im stuck on."
I have it working by setting the X and Y values of the arrow ImageView but obviously the place of the arrow changes when i test my application in different screen sizes even though im coverting a dp value to pixels.
How can I position the arrow ImageView so that it stays the same in different screen sizes?

What the Chicken Base actually is?
"To explain it in the simplest way possible, the chicken base is a paste that can be used to create a base for gravy, soup, and stock."
"It's mostly used to give the flavor to liquids, but it can also be used to marinate meat."
"The chicken base can be found in supermarkets, but you can make your own as well."
"It usually contains the following ingredients: chicken meat, chicken fat, salt, milk, soy, and sugar."
"The difference between Chicken Base, Stock and Bouillon

Although you can achieve very similar flavor with all of these, they are quite different."
I can tell you from my experience that not even the flavors come out the same.
"They leave a very similar taste in the mouth, but the richness of flavors is very different."
Bouillon is just like the chicken base in the form of small cubes.
"It adds the flavor to sauces, soups, and stews."
"Basically, a chicken bouillon is dehydrated chicken stock."
The difference between the bouillon and chicken base is that the bouillon is much saltier.
Chicken stock is a liquid with rich chicken flavors.
It's made with chicken bones and whole chicken parts.
"It may also contain spices, herbs, salt, pepper and a lot of vegetables for the ultimate flavor."
"The biggest difference between the chicken stock, bouillon and the chicken base is that it's the only one in the liquid form."
Chicken base is the chicken stock in the concentrated form.
"Since it's derived from the liquid, it's mostly found in the form of a paste, but it can be found in the form of powder and cube."
I would recommend chicken base in the form of paste because it has a richer flavor.
"Chicken Base Advantages

We established that all three options for chicken flavor are similar."
"So, why would you use the chicken base instead of the other two?"
"I've tried all of them, and I can say that chicken base adds the best chicken flavor of them all."
"It also provides a richer color and a better consistency, which is crucial for gravies, sauces, stews, soups, etc."
"No matter what kind of chicken flavored dish you want to make, the chicken base will always be a better choice than chicken stock or bouillon."
I love how my soups get a rich color; gravies have just the right consistency and stews have that rich flavor I want to achieve.
"How to Make Your Own Chicken Base

Making your own chicken base is the not difficult task at all, and you can tune the flavor just how you like it."
"All it takes is these 7 simple steps:

Prepare the ingredients: To make a chicken base, you will need a whole chicken, garlic, onions, carrots, celery, bay leaves, salt, pepper, and cheesecloth."
Make a stock: The first step in the making process is to create a chicken stock.
It's extremely simple.
Fill a pot full of water and leave it on the stove.
"While you wait for the water to boil, chop the garlic, carrots, onions, and celery."
"Add the ingredients: When the water reaches its boiling temperature, add all of the ingredients you previously prepared."
Reduce the stock: Simmer all the ingredients until the part of the water is reduced.
Continue doing so until there are only two-thirds of the water left.
"Be patient, because it will require a lot of hours to complete."
"To keep the ingredients from sticking, stir them from time to time."
"Cool it off: When you reduced your stock, it's time to let it cool off."
"You should let it cool off on its own for some time, and then leave it in the fridge."
"But, before you do, take out the cooked chicken, debone it and chop it into pieces."
"Make the paste: Check on the stock in the fridge after some time, and take it out once you see the fat separate on the top."
"Remove the fat, and press the rest through the cheesecloth to make the chicken base paste."
Store it: The done chicken paste can be stored up to three months in the fridge if you store it in the airtight container.
"That way it will preserve all the flavors, and it will stay fresh for longer time."
"Extra Tips on Homemade Chicken Base

There's more to the making of the chicken base than just following the recipe, and you learn this over time."
"Since I already made a couple of them, I can give you some pointers that will be helpful from the start."
"When you're ready to store the chicken base, it will be better to separate it into smaller containers for easier future use."
"Even though you made a paste, and not the powdered version, you can create small cubes using ice trays; just make sure the tray can be sealed, so the paste doesn't lose its flavor."
The chicken base has to be made with bony chicken parts if you want to achieve that rich flavor.
The vegetables and seasonings can be added according to your personal taste.
Modify the ingredients based on the type of dishes you will be cooking.
"For example, if you plan on making some Mexican chicken dishes, add some cilantro."
You can use your homemade chicken base for a lot of various dishes.
"It can be used for holiday dressing, stuffing, and even rice, just to add it some flavor."
"Even though the whole chicken is recommended, you don't have to use both dark and white meat."
"You can choose which one to use, as long as you don't debone it."
"What to Do if You Don't Have the Time to Make Your Own Chicken Base

The homemade chicken base is better because you can adjust the ingredients just how you like it, but sometimes you won't have the time to go through the cooking process that can last up to several hours."
"In these cases, you can just buy the prepared chicken base from the store."
I'd like to point out that store-bought chicken base will never be as healthy as the homemade one.
"Pay attention to the ingredients used, and make sure its FDA approved."
A good and simple way to check the ingredients of the chicken base is that the chicken is the first on the list of ingredients.
"Also, pay attention to the additives, and artificial flavors, if it has one."
"Usually, they do."
"Also, the store-bought chicken base can be rich in sodium, which can be bad for your health if it has more than the recommended daily amount."
"The safe amount of sodium consumed per day is maximum 2,3gr, depending on the age of the person."
Some of the chicken bases can have half of the maximum daily amount in a single serving.
"How to Select the Best Chicken Base from the Store

The chicken base was usually sold and produced in bulk, which helped people have a cost-effective way to make semi-homemade food, mostly used in the food industry and restaurants."
"Today, smaller packages are available for smaller consumers, which can be used by individuals in their homes."
"Nowadays, you can find a chicken base in large grocery stores and online."
To get the best chicken base is to know its ingredients and its storage options.
I would recommend you to get the chicken base made by the smaller manufacturers who specialize in making it.
"Check the ingredients carefully and in detail, make sure it's not high in sodium, and it satisfies the dietary needs."
"Also, narrow down your choice based on how you would like to store it later."
Some chicken base packages can last longer than the others.
"Conclusion

To sum up our chicken base story, I would always recommend you to try my recipe and make your own."
"If that's not your thing, and it's too time-consuming for you, then buy the finished one from the store."
Your dish will still be better off with the store bought chicken base than it would be with chicken stock or bouillon.

"F actual and Procedural Background

At the reverse amenability hearing on July 6, 2017, Detective Mackenzie
Kirlin testified on behalf of the State and stated that, on January 9, 2017, police
responded to a homicide and robbery scene at a corner store located at 101 North
Clayton Street in Wilmington, Delaware."
"Police found the store clerk dead from an
apparent gunshot wound."
"Change was strewn about the store floor and countertop,
suggestive of a robbery."
"On January lO, 2017, Defendant’s co-defendant, Devonte Dorsett (“Dorsett”),
was arrested in relation to the above incident At the time of his arrest, he was
carrying a firearm that was later linked with ballistics evidence recovered at the
crime scene."
"Dorsett was interviewed at the Wilmington Police Department and described
his version of the events on January 9, 2017."
"He told police that, on that date, he
was present at his friends’ residence located at 204 North Clayton Street."
"Defendant
was also at the residence, visiting another person who lived at this address."
"Dorsett
stated that it was Defendant’s idea to rob the corner store."
"Dorsett responded that he
wanted to rob a nearby “7-1 l” store."
"Nevertheless, the two traveled together to rob
the corner store on Clayton Street."
"Dorsett further admitted to possessing the gun and explained that Defendant
did not carry the firearm at any time during the robbery."
"As the two entered the
store, Dorsett stated that he displayed the firearm and demanded that the clerk open
the cash register."
Dorsett then told Defendant to pillage the cash register for money.
"As Defendant retrieved the money from the cash register, Dorsett and the clerk
began to “tussle” with one another."
"Defendant jumped the countertop to leave and
dropped change in the process."
Dorsett yelled at him to pick up the money.
Defendant refused and fled the store.
"As Defendant fled, Dorsett claims he
accidentally discharged his gun, striking the clerk."
"He ran from the store and stated
that he only found out online the next day that the clerk had died from the gunshot

wound."
"After Dorsett’s interview, he identified Defendant from a photo."
"Defendant
was arrested that same day and interviewed at the Wilmington Police Department."
Defendant described a somewhat different version of the robbery.
"Defendant stated that he was at the residence on Clayton Street when Dorsett

2

grabbed him and took him to the basement of the residence Dorsett was high on
drugs and alcohol.3 He showed Defendant the gun and told him that they were going
to rob the corner store."
"Dorsett told Defendant that he would shoot him if he did not
agree to assist in the robbery."
Defendant complied.
"According to Defendant’s version, they entered the store and Dorsett drew his
gun."
"Pointing the gun at Defendant, Dorsett told him to grab the money from the
cash register The “tussle” occurred when Dorsett blocked the doorway and
prevented the clerk from escaping the store."
"Defendant explained that he left the
store after refusing to pick up the change on the ground."
"He heard a shot while
outside the store."
He fled the scene.
"After fleeing the store, he returned to the Clayton Street residence."
"There, he
encountered Dorsett again."
"Defendant impressed upon someone at the residence to
tell Dorsett to leave the residence One of the residents instructed Dorsett to leave
and he did."
"Defendant moved to transfer his case to Family Court on April 26, 2017."
"A
reverse amenability hearing was held on July 6, 2017."
"At the hearing, the State
called two witnesses: Det."
"Kirlin and Jennifer Skinner, Master Family Service
Specialist for the New Castle County Detention Center."
"Additionally, the parties stipulated to the introduction of three reports: one
from Robin Belcher-Timme, Psy.D."
"; a Second report from Taunya Batista, M.A."
";
and a third from Ms. Skinner on behalf of the Department of Services for Children,
Youth and Their Families, Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services (“YRS”)."
"After considering the parties’ submissions, arguments, and the testimony during the
reverse amenability hearing, this is the Court’s decision on Defendant’s Motion."
"Standam' of Review
The reverse amenability process is meant to identify those juveniles charged

as adults who are amenable to the rehabilitative processes of the Family Court.4 If
the juvenile files a motion to transfer the adult charges, this Court must hold a reverse

2016).
"See Hughes v. State, 653 A.2d 241,
249 (Del."
"1994) (quoting Marine v. State, 624 A.2d 1181, 1184 (Del."

A.2d 1185, 1209 (Del."
1992)).
amenability hearing and weigh the four factors set forth in 10 Del.
"C. § 101 1(b).5

Under § 1011(b), the Court may consider evidence of: (l) “[t]he nature of the
present offense and the extent and nature of the defendant’s prior record, if any;” (2)
“[t]he nature of past treatment and rehabilitative efforts and the nature of the
defendant’s response thereto, if any;” (3) “[w]hether the interests of society and the
defendant would be best served by trial in the Family Court or in the Superior Court;”
and (4) any “other factors which, in the judgment of the Court are deemed relevant.”6

Before the Court weighs these factors, however, “the Court must preliminarily
determine whether the State has made out a prima facie case against the juvenile,
meaning whether there is a fair likelihood that [the defendant] will be convicted of
the crimes charged.”7 There is a fair likelihood that the defendant will be convicted
if, after reviewing the totality of the evidence presented, it appears that, if the defense
does not sufficiently rebut the State’s evidence, “the likelihood of a conviction is
real."
.
.
".”8 Furthermore, “[a] real probability must exist that a reasonable jury could
convict on the totality of the evidence assuming that the evidence adduced at the
reverse amenability hearing stands unrebutted by the defendant at trial.”9

Discussion

As a preliminary comment, it should be noted that the State’s argument
against transfer included a contention that a shorter sentence in the juvenile justice
system is simply “not enough” of a sanction for Defendant’s alleged conduct."
"The
General Assembly sets the statutory ranges for criminal offenses, including those for
juvenile offenders Abstract arguments about the appropriateness of a sentence miss
the mark."
"The Court will not consider this argument lnstead, the Court focuses
solely on the factors under § 101 1(b)."
"Further, it is important to note what distinguishes this Motion from other
motions to transfer regularly addressed by this Court."
"Defendant is charged with

two counts of PFDCF.
According to ll Del.
"C. § 1447A(f): “Every person charged
[with PFDCF] over the age of 15 years shall be tried as an adult, notwithstanding
any contrary provisions or statutes governing the Family Court or any other state
law.”lo Therefore, as a threshold matter, given Defendant’s age of 14 at the time of
the alleged offenses, the customary jurisdictional restrictions involving firearms
charges are absent in this Motion."
"As such, the parties agree that the Court has
discretion, under § 101 l(b), to transfer all of the charged offenses against Defendant
to Family Court.ll

I."
"Likelihood of Conviction

The Court finds that there is a fair likelihood of Defendant’s conviction at
trial."
"ln either version of the robbery, Defendant engaged in acts that, if proved at
trial, would support a conviction for the charged offenses."
"Defendant’S version of
the robbery differs from Dorsett’s; nevertheless, were the jury to hear Dorsett’s
version of the robbery, the jury could reasonably accept his version of the events and
discount Defendant’s version."
"ln such a case, were Defendant unsuccessful in
rebutting the State’s case, there would exist a “real probability” of conviction."
"Defendant argued that the Court should consider the affirmative defense of
duress in this analysis."
"The State argued that this defense was immaterial to its
burden to prove a prima facie case against Defendant."
"Even assuming, arguendo,
that evidence of duress is raised at trial, this Court finds that there remains a fair
likelihood that Defendant will be convicted of the charged offenses.12 Though

11 See generally 10 Del.
C. § 541 (2013 & Supp.
"2016) (“The Superior Court shall have such
jurisdiction as the Constitution and laws of this State confer upon it.”); § 922 (describing Family
Court’s exclusive and concurrent original criminal jurisdiction); § 1010 (describing procedures
applicable to: “proceeding against child as an adult; amenability proceeding; referral to another
court”)."
"12 Originally, this threshold analysis-the requirement that the State establish a prima facie case
against the defendant at the reverse amenability hearing_derived from what is today the first
prong ofthe § 1011(b): “nature ofthe present offense.” Marine v. State, 607 A.2d 1185, 1211-12
(Del."
1992).
This showing was analogized to a “proof positive” hearing.

"“In each situation, a
judicial examination of the evidentiary justification for the charging decision is required.” Ia'."
"at
1212 (citing In re Steigler, 250 A.2d 379, 383 (Del."
1969)).
"Though the statute has been amended on several occasions over the past 25 years, this
requirement has endured."
"However, because this threshold analysis looks to the charging decision
and its independent evidentiary basis, the viability of an anticipated affirmative defense, such as
duress, is of questionable import

Defendant reportedly participated in the offenses to a lesser extent than his co-
defendant, at this point, there remains “[a] real probability ."
.
.
"that a reasonable jury
could convict [Defendant] on the totality of the evidence assuming that the evidence
adduced at the reverse amenability hearing stands unrebutted” at trial.13

Thus, the State has met its burden of demonstrating a prima facie case against
Defendant with a fair likelihood of conviction at trial."
II.
"Nature of Present Offense and Defendant’s Prior Record

The Court now turns to an analysis of the four statutory factors outlined in
§ 1011(b)."
"Preliminarily, the State concedes that three of the four factors to be
considered weigh in favor of transfer."
"The State, however, argues that the nature of
the present offense and society’s interest suggest that the case should remain in
Superior Court."
A.
"Nature of Present Offense

The first § 1011(b) factor is two-pronged.14 The first prong of the first factor
inquiries into the nature of the present offense."
"ln this case, the severity of the
charged offenses is patent."
"However, the charges distort Defendant’s role in the
underlying offenses."
"While Defendant actively assisted Dorsett in pillaging the cash
register, Defendant was commanded to do so by his armed co-defendant, presumably
the same person who threatened to shoot him if he did not help him commit the
robbery."
"Further, Dorsett is several years older than Defendant."
"In other contexts,
the United States Supreme Court has recognized the “mitigating qualities of youth,”
which includes a judicial and scientific recognition of the juvenile’s proclivity to act
impulsively and irresponsibly due to innumerable intrinsic and extrinsic factors.15

This Court considers Defendant’s age and the nature and extent of his
involvement in the “nature of the present offense” prong."
"Despite Defendant’s
potentially coerced involvement in the robbery, the Court finds that this prong of the
first factor weighs against transfer."
"B. Defendant’s Prior Record
Defendant has a minimal juvenile record."
"To wit, the State ’s witness, Ms. Skinner, recommends that Defendant be found
amenable to the rehabilitative processes of the Family Court.16 Her report concludes
with the following recommendation, on behalf of YRS: “Given [Defendant] has no
prior adjudications or service history; and the fact that [the] Superior Court does not
have exclusive jurisdiction over any of the charges based upon his age, []YRS
recommends [Defendant] be found amenable and return to [the] Family Court.”17

The Court finds that the second prong of this factor weighs in favor of
transferring Defendant’s case to Family Court."
III.
"Nature of Past Treatment and Defendant’s Response

Defendant has a minimal past treatment history."
"Ms. Skinner testified that the Division of Family Services (“DFS”) did receive
numerous calls regarding his mother’s alleged neglect of Defendant and his siblings

when Defendant was younger."
"The first six times DFS was called, the complaint
was closed as: “unsubstantiated with concern.” At some point, the situation

 

over their own environment” and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-
producing settings."

of transfer to the Family Court."
IV.
"Interests of Society and Defendant

The State argues that the interests of society are best served by keeping the
charges in this Court, in part, because of Defendant’s prior child welfare history and
the risk that, upon leaving the Family Court system, he would remain
dependent/neglected and without parental supervision Thus, the argument goes,
Defendant would likely recidivate immediately into a criminal lifestyle Instead, the
State believes that a longer period of incarceration in adult prison is best in order to
ensure the protection of society."
"This Court disagrees and finds that the interests of society and Defendant
would be best served by transfer to the Family Court."
"Placing a juvenile in adult
prison, immersed with other adult offenders, and without the benefit of targeted
rehabilitative services runs against the interests of society."
"Moreover, every indication is that Defendant is amenable to the rehabilitative
processes of the Family Court."
"His young age, lack of prior treatment, and his
minimal juvenile history all suggest that transfer to the Family Court is appropriate
Though the nature of the charges is serious, all the other § 1011(b) factors point
strongly in favor of transfer."
"So, too, do the interests of society and Defendant weigh
heavily in favor of transfer to the Family Court.28

 

26 Additionally, the Family Court may extend jurisdiction over Defendant until age twenty-one
See 10 Del."
C. §§ 928-29 (2013 & Supp.
2016).
"27 Furthermore, the report of Taunya Batista, M.A., admitted at the reverse amenability hearing,
suggests that Defendant is amenable to the rehabilitative processes of the Family Court."
"See
generally Taunya J. Batista, M.A., Amenability Report Preparea1 for.'"
"Jakevis Lamont Ellington
(July 3, 2017)."
"28 The fourth factor of § 1011(b)_-0ther relevant factors the Court deems relevant_has been
sufficiently addressed in the other § 101 1(b) factors such that the Court need not explicitly address
this factor in its opinion."
"Conclusion

“[T]he interests of justice would be best served by” the transfer of Defendant’ s
case to Family Court.29 As such, for the reasons stated above, Defendant’s Motion
to Transfer the Case to Family Court is GRANTED."
IT IS SO ORDERED.

Prenatal protocol usage.
"A review was conducted of 825 obstetrics cases on active computer file at the Department of Family and Community Medicine in Little Rock, Arkansas."
Independent raters evaluated faculty and resident usage of a prenatal protocol which was routinely used as a teaching tool in the department's residency program since 1972.
Significant differences were found to exist with regard to usage of the tool by physician status.
Faculty were more consistent and thorough in their usage of the teaching tool when compared to residents.
"Differences were explained in terms of a practice effect, research bias of faculty, levels of practice, and potential weaknesses in the educational program."
"Fears of new Ghoulam knee fracture

By Football Italia staff

There are fears Napoli and Algeria full-back Faouzi Ghoulam has fractured his kneecap for a second time."
"The 27-year-old has been out of action since November 2017, as he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and then fractured his kneecap during training in February."
"According to Radio CRC, there are genuine concerns he may have damaged the same kneecap again."
"They claim to have spoken to the Villa Stuart clinic and Professor Mariani, who was worried by the latest tests sent over to him, but wants to visit Ghoulam personally before making a diagnosis."
There are reports the player took advice from an NBA specialist rather than his professional trainer and the exercises prompted his knee to swell up again.
"It’s a bitter blow for the Partenopei, who were hoping to either play Ghoulam this season or sell him, with Manchester United strongly interested."

"Q:

Communication between networks without routing - is it possible?"
Could someone please tell me if my understanding is correct?
"I created 2 simple networks in Packet Tracer and ""wired"" them together with router."
I have not set up any routing (neither static nor dynamic) for the router.
And yet both of my networks can communicate with each other.
Is this proper behaviour ?
The only thing I can think of is that router knows all networks that are connected to it so within it there is no need for setting up routing protocols.
"But still, I remember when I was told that for two networks to communicate there is need of a router (and implicitly I assumed routing protocols are required)."
"A:

Routing protocols are used by routers to communicate their routes with each other."
"If you only have one router, there is no one for that router to talk to, and therefore no need for routing protocols."
"Don't confuse routing - forwarding based on layer 3 information
with routing protocols -- a method for routers to communicate their reachability."

Back after a nine day overseas trip, President Donald Trump returned to a familiar plan of operations on Sunday, as he used Twitter to jab at his critics and the news media, vowing to push ahead on his legislative agenda in the Congress, and making clear he wants a crack down on leaks from the U.S. Government."
“Just returned from Europe.
Trip was a great success for America.
Hard work but big results!” the President said early on Sunday morning.
"Here are some things to look for with Mr. Trump back at the White House:

1."
The President isn’t going silent on Twitter.
"Despite some news reports while he was gone that aides have tried to limit Mr. Trump’s time on social media, @realDonaldTrump was doing more than just highlighting White House talking points, as he issued a series of tweets on Sunday morning and later in the evening that plowed familiar ground."
The Twitter barrage started softly – “Big win in Montana for Republicans!” the President tweeted about Thursday’s special election victory for the GOP – but then the President revved his engines.
"“Fake News is the enemy,” Mr. Trump said, as he took aim at the news media."
The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging & demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
2.
Will the President be firing White House leakers?
"Another story that broke while Mr. Trump was gone was one that said three leakers inside the White House had been identified, and that the President would be getting rid of them once he returned to the U.S. No names were revealed, but it has resulted in plenty of rumors across the political spectrum, especially more from conservative figures on social media, who publicly pointed the finger at aides whom they argued are not reliably supportive of the President."
"While those stories have circulated, Mr. Trump floated a different possibility – that maybe there aren’t leaks after all."
It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.
3.
Don’t forget the Trump Agenda in Congress.
"The President on Sunday pressed two of his biggest agenda items, tax cuts and overhaul of the Obama health law."
One interesting note was that Mr. Trump seemed to argue for more spending in a GOP health plan that is now before the Senate.
"“I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere,” the President tweeted."
"The idea of spending more money on health care is not the GOP goal, as their plan would reduce spending on Medicaid by over $800 billion over the next ten years."
And Mr. Trump’s budget trims another $600 billion in Medicaid spending.
"For now, Senators still haven’t forged a deal that can get a majority on health care – that will be their focus when they return to work on June 5."
"Asking the Republicans to spend more government money on health care does not seem to be a GOP priority, even though Mr. Trump tweeted out that idea."
I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere.
ObamaCare is dead – the Republicans will do much better!
4.
The President presses for tax reform.
"In his Sunday tweets, Mr. Trump also used the bully pulpit to call for action in the Congress on tax cuts and tax reform."
"While both the House and Senate have held some introductory hearings, no real details have been handed out – other than one page of bullet points from the White House."
"While the President says it is “ahead of schedule,” Congress cannot act on a tax package until lawmakers finish action on health care overhaul."
"Despite his tweet, Mr. Trump’s tax plan has a lot of details that are TBD – and it’s not even clear that Congress can act on tax reform this year."
"The massive TAX CUTS/REFORM that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule."
Big benefits to all!
5.
"Is the White House readying a “War Room?” While the President jabbed at the press over leaks, he didn’t give any hints on whether there would a shakeup in his own communications team, which has been reported by a number of news organizations, saying the White House is ready to set up a rapid response team to deal with stories about the Russia investigation, and other matters for top staffers."
"The Russia story didn’t go away with Mr. Trump in Europe, and it won’t be easy to sidestep once he is back at the White House."
6.
Will Spicer be out?
Or just to the side?
"While the President was overseas, there were reports that Mr. Trump was ready to make major changes in how the communications team deals with the press."
"The White House has denied that Press Secretary Sean Spicer will be pushed out, but his job security has been the subject of roller coaster rumors for the past four months; we could see more of Sarah Sanders at briefings."
"There have also been rumblings about making major changes in the White House briefings, maybe even doing away with the televised daily briefing."
That would certainly make some news.
Making briefings off-camera removes a level of accountability for White House officials.
At this level.. have the guts to go on camera.
"27 comments:

I'm still not sure if he actually is too attached to negotiating beyond the point of hope with Republicans."
But it sure has hell seemed like it the first term.
"This isn't the Republican party he dealt with when he was in the Senate, even."
I hope that realization comes or has already come.
"I'm not sure how much he may have believed this initially, but by now he should have figured out that simply calling on Republicans to be bipartisan is unlikely to convince them."
"Doesn't mean it's not a worthy end, just that's it's a terrible means."
I hope Obama has learned not to underestimate the ignorance of the American people.
"Regardless of how easy he thinks it is to understand a proposed policy, he needs to communicate with the public as though he were explaining the policy to his daughters when they were kindergartners."
"I really hope he's begun to understand that you don't achieve bipartisanship by proposing bipartisan policies, you achieve it by holding firm and forcing the other side to knuckle under."
"Also, the American people are COOL WITH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE BLACK, so quite worrying about that."
I'm going to take what seems to be an unpopular position here.
I think that Obama's posture of negotiating with the Republcans *as if* they were reasonable was good politics--not because it helped him with confirmed Republicans (it didn't) but because it helped convince moderate voters that Obama was reasonable and the GOP was crazy.
This no doubt helped Obama to get re-elected and the Democrats to make gains in both the Senate and House last year.
And virtually every agreement he eventually reached with the GOP was much less a sell-out than some progressives first labeled it.
"(Even Krugman admitted that the fiscal cliff deal was not that bad on the merits; he was only worried that it foreshadowed a future cave by Obama on the debt ceiling--and as Krugman has admitted, he was wrong about that.)"
I hope he learned that Republicans will never agree with his agenda and must either find a way to negotiate in a way that does not compromise his goals or stick to his guns and hope he keeps backing them against the wall.
"Also, like Moneyball said, he needs to explain his policies to the public in a way that is broken down and understandable."
I think one of the reasons why people got so confident in Obama was because of Clinton's DNC speech.
He managed to dismantle the Republican platform just by translating their rhetoric into English.
Obama needs to follow that lead in order to have people by his side.
I hope Obama will look for ways to enact his agenda outside of just trying to get bills through Congress.
"Passing laws and budgets is important, but so is appointing judges and staffing the government, he shouldn't do one to the detriment of the other."
"I'm sure Obama has learned the ropes of the presidency, but - unlike everyone above except perhaps David T - I can't think of any Big Lessons he should have learned."
"In his first two years, with a Dem congress, he racked up huge accomplishments."
"In the last two years, facing a very tough headwind, he set the stage to win re-election and then thump the GOP."
"In particular he was playing a terrible hand in 2011 - the GOP had won big in the midterms, and the economy was still effectively in the crapper."
"But the original debt limit deal turned out to be to his strategic advantage, as we are now seeing."
"Maybe it isn't 11-dimensional chess, but he has certainly played a few moves ahead of the Republicans."
1.
Pay a lot of attention to executive branch and judicial nominations - select nominees and then push the Senate to confirm them.2.
Recognize when you have leverage and use it.
You can't count on the Republican Party to act in the country's interest.3.
Use the bully pulpit.
"It might or might not influence Republican votes in Congress, but it can help make the public more aware of who is gumming up the works on popular initiatives."
"BTW, I am fairly confident he has learned lessons 2 and 3."
Not sure about 1.
The truth is the GOP doesn't support the conservative base.
It supports the industrial/military complex.
Until the vast majority of American's wake up to the fact that both parties have only one agenda and that is reelection then the only view our politicians will have is that of those can finance thier campaigns.
Without term limits this country is headed for disaster.
Government can and does create jobs.
"Your stimulus worked and all the predictions that Republicans and other deficit peacocks made about soaring interest rates, hyperinflation, etc."
were wrong.
So stop with the austerity already.
Phorbol ester and okadaic acid regulation of Na-2Cl-K cotransport in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells.
We evaluated a role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of rabbit tracheal epithelial Na-Cl(K) cotransport.
"Short-term treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) dose dependently increased bumetanide-sensitive Na and Cl efflux and elevated staurosporine- and bumetanide-sensitive Na, Cl, and K uptake."
PMA and the alpha 2A-adrenergic agonist guanabenz both induced contransport with a stoichiometry of 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb and elevated staurosporine-sensitive PKC activity in cytosolic and particulate fractions.
Prolonged PMA treatment did not sustain bumetanide-sensitive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb transport but did block stimulation of bumetanide-sensitive transport by PMA or guanabenz and elevation of PKC activity by PMA and guanabenz in a particulate fraction.
Cells treated with okadaic acid exhibited a staurosporine- and bumetanide-sensitive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb uptake.
"In cultured monolayers, basolateral perfusion with epinephrine, isoproterenol, or PMA increased short-circuit current (Isc)."
"Basolateral application of bumetanide reduced elevated Isc to baseline levels, indicating a role for Cl secretory cells in a reconstituted tracheal epithelium."
Pretreatment of transmonolayer cultures with PMA diminished the stimulatory response to epinephrine.
"These results indicate that, in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells, alpha-adrenergic stimulation activated Na-2Cl-K cotransport and that PKC is a critical effector in this process."

Targeting injury-related synaptic plasticity for the treatment of chronic pain.
Recent investigations of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain provide new hopes for more effective treatments for patients with chronic pain.
"At the molecular and genetic levels, new proteins and genes related to sensory sensation have been identified."
"However, many of these new discoveries have not resulted in better and more effective treatments for chronic pain."
"This disconnect between discovery and better treatment options is due, in part to the negative side effects associated with new treatment options, and also as a result of the ineffectiveness of these new drugs for inhibiting chronic pain."
"In this review, I will explore this disconnect between discovery and treatment, and propose that the failure of previous medicines can be due to their limited effects on injury-related plasticity, and question the common misperception of seeking compounds for high efficacy before understanding basic mechanisms of the target proteins in pain-related plasticity."
"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Alabama's T.J. Yeldon chose not to speak with the media Monday, but the sophomore running back issued an apology for his unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Texas A&M."
"Yeldon, who rushed for 149 yards and a touchdown in the top-ranked Crimson Tide's 49-42 win Saturday over the No."
"6 Aggies in College Station, Texas, drew the ire of Alabama coach Nick Saban after his second-quarter score when he mocked outspoken A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel's ""show me the money"" gesture, capping it off with a double throat-slashing expression."
"""I want to apologize to everyone for my selfish actions on Saturday,"" Yeldon said in the release."
"""That is not the way I want to represent myself, my family and our team."
"""That is not the way we do things at Alabama."
"This is something that I will learn from, and I will use better judgment in the future."""

"Over the 30 plus years that my husband, Jim, and I have been together, I have made him a lot of shirts, vests, jackets, pants, and even a parka."
"Some of them, he really likes, and wears a lot, and some, well…."
"not so much, and even though I think that they look great on him, if he isn’t comfortable in it, he won’t wear it."
"The first piece of fabric for Jim's shirt being woven on an Emila rigid heddle loom

copyright Noreen Crone-Findlay

So, when I decided to weave a shirt for him to wear at his various festival gigs this summer (he’s a jazz musician), the first and most important criteria was to make it comfortable!"
"It has to be a style that he likes (he likes ‘traditional’ shirts, not the ethnic styles that I like), and the fabric couldn’t be too wild (ahem, not like something that I would wear- very large grin accompanying this statement)."
"3rd piece of fabric being woven on Peacock loom for Jim's shirt

Jim’s a very gentle, laid back guy, and kind of shy, so he’s not into wearing stuff that is toooooooooo wild, although he does have a rather spectacular collection of ‘tractor’ shirts that our daughter and I have made for him over the years."
"(He loves his vintage tractor, and he loves making hay, so we keep our eyes open for fabric that has tractors on it."
"But, that’s another story.)"
"So, anyhow, when I decided to weave him a shirt, I had him choose the colors, and I warped up my Glimakra Emilia rigid heddle loom."
(I bought it from a friend on Ravelry).
"I wove a 4 meter length of fabric, and thought that it was toooooo bland."
"So I warped up the next panel of 4 meters with a different, more striking arrangement of stripes, and I liked that a lot more."
These 2 pieces shrank from being 18 1/2 inches wide to 16 inches wide and got a 1/2 meter shorter after washing.
"At first, I thought that I wasn’t going to use the first bland-ish piece so, I warped up my Peacock 2 harness table loom, and wove a 10 meter long piece of fabric, with the stripes going horizontally, instead of vertically."
"copyright Noreen Crone-Findlay

But, when I laid it out, to start cutting it out, I realized that I needed the first chunk of fabric, too."
"I had been pleading with Jim to let me puhleeeeeeeeeeeeeze put some embellishment on his shirt, so he said, okay and let me weave up a Celtic interlace for the collar, cuffs, and button band:

Celtic interlace band woven on Vesterheim Museum Cradle Loom with heddle made by Fred Hatton

Last winter, I bought a lovely little heddle from Fred Hatton, and when I was weaving the Celtic interlace band, I couldn’t resist drawing rabbits on it and burning them on."
"The cradle loom is from the Vesterheim Museum

I had to piece the sleeves, so decided to get decorative with them, too, and wove another pair of bands to embellish the seams:

woven pick up technique on narrow band

Of course, cutting out handwoven fabric is always a touch jittery…."
"cutting out handwoven fabric for Jim's shirt

I zig zag around each piece to keep it from fraying."
Sewing the shirt together was pure heaven!
It went together just beautifully.
"This is a pattern Simplicity 2741 that I have used a lot, so I am very familiar with it."
It’s a quick and easy shirt that looks great.
"(and is comfortable 😀 )

Every seam is stitched at least twice, and sometimes more, for stability."
"I used hem tape on the hem, and there are 6 lines of stitching alone at the hem."
"With handwoven fabrics, I tend to ‘oversew’ just for security."
"So, tahdah!"
"Here it is:

Making this shirt for my beloved gave me the opportunity to pour a whole ton of love into a physical object that will wrap him in my love, appreciation and gratitude."
"Truly, there is love in EVERY stitch!!!!"
"And, if he finds that it’s not comfie, well then, I’ll wear it!"
"😀

(But he does say that he likes it, so I hope it will be a pleasure for him to wear it and make beautiful music in it!)"

Hi Sharon
🙂 Yes, it is indeed!"
He’s worth it 😀 It was a genuine pleasure to make it for him.
"He is ALWAYS doing lovely things for me, so it feels good to make him something extra special."
"AND, I am so pleased that you feel inspired to pick up your looms!"
"That’s why I posted about it 🙂

This is absolutely breathtaking!"
"You have such a visionary and amazing talent for creative weaving, woodworking and goodness knows, everything else."
Thank you so much for posting your husband’s new handwoven shirt and the process of producing it.
May he wear it with pride and be inspired to let those jazzy notes flow forth into your waiting ears!
Oh my goodness – that is so amazing!
I love all the embellished bands – and the whole thing just came together in a most spectacular (but subdued and comfortable of course 🙂 ) way.
I absolutely LOVE it.
"Thank you so much, Jan!"
What a BEAUTIFUL comment!
"and I agree… I hope it gives him even more inspiration when he plays… he has written several pieces for me, and I always melt when his trio plays them… 🙂

Hi Barb
Thanks so much!"

I love the Sami band weaving technique that I learned from Susan Foulkes, book: Sami band weaving : Sami band weavinghttp://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/2231336."
"Susan also generously posted tutorials to the very neat group on yahoo: Braids and Bands
Doing pickup weaving with the Sami technique is much faster than inkle pickup."
"I have woven many a mile of pickup technique with inkle, but am now smitten with the possibilities of working with the Sami technique."
"Also, working with the double hole heddle for weaving pickup bands is just so neat!"
"No profit in raving about Grace and Fred Hatton’s heddles or Susan Foulke’s book, just think that they are wonderful!"
"😀

Hi there, I was wondering if you know what type of cotton you used for the shirt?"
"I see you’ve mentioned the sett was 12 epi, but do you know what the cotton was (8/2, 16/2, 22/2, 30/2, 33/3 etc)?"

Thank you so much!"
The new shirt is going to be much more wild and wheeling… I hope that he’ll like it!
"LOL
(If he doesn’t, then he won’t wear it, but I will) 🙂

Would you have any updated information on how to purchase one of these looms?
Thanks for any inforamtion!
thanks so much!
I found one.
I bought it.
I am fulfilled 🙂 Do you weave often on it?
"I’m really excited to see what I can do with it, but I do have one question: how fine can it weave?"
I did some research and all I could find was that the reed on the loom was an 8 dent…do you think it’s possible to put a finer reed on it?

A:

You can also use profiles via CLI."
This is totally unattended and if your profile requires any user input it will fail to install.
I've successfully deployed WiFi networks via Puppet using this method.
"The command to install a profile is:
sudo profiles -I -F /path/to/profile.mobileconfig
Running as sudo/root will install the profile as a Device Profile and affects all users while installing as the current user will just install it as a User profile thus just affecting the User which ran the command."

Socializing the Mortgage Industry

That is what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke appears to be pushing."
Apparently he is suggesting having government agencies buy up bad mortgages and refinance them with much more favorable terms or having the government subsidize private loans.
When privatizing fails then socialize.
When socializing is working then privatize.
That seems to be the way the system works - by default or by design is a debate for another time.
"“Despite good-faith efforts by both the private and public sectors, the foreclosure rate remains too high, with adverse consequences for both those directly involved and for the broader economy,” [Bernanke] said at the Federal Reserve System Conference on Housing and Mortgage Markets."
"...Calling the problems in the housing and mortgage markets “inextricably intertwined” with broader financial and economic developments, Mr. Bernanke listed a slew of “promising options” that are aimed to reduce avoidable foreclosures."
"Under one proposal, Mr. Bernanke called on Congress to ease the terms of the government’s ""Hope for Homeowners"" plan, which allows lenders to refinance a delinquent borrower into a new, Federal Housing Authority-insured fixed-rate mortgage if the lender writes down the mortgage balance to create some home equity for the borrower."
"In another proposal, he suggested that Congress lower lenders’ upfront insurance premiums and reduce the interest rate that borrowers pay, which is currently “quite high,” at roughly 8%."
"To lower the interest rate, the Treasury could purchase securities issued by Ginnie Mae of Washington to fund the program, or Congress can subsidize the rate."
"The whole video is good, but the part directly related to this post starts at about 4:30."
The goal is probably not to socialize the mortgage industry.
"But it has to be more specific than just ""save the economy."""
"Without a coherent strategy we are just cobbling together ideas, wasting money, and increasing the incompetence."
And we are paying an incredibly high price in doing so.
"Q:

What type literal must I use to have CDI's Instance::select method work properly?"
"Suppose I have an interface like this:
public interface Converter<T> { /*...*/ }

And suppose in a CDI environment I have successfully done this:
@Inject
@Any
private Instance<Converter<?>> converters;

(By ""successfully"" I mean that I can do the following and see several converters in the output, so beans are being discovered and supplied properly:
for (final Object o : converters) {
  System.out.println(""*** converter: "" + o);
}

…so bean discovery is not the issue.)"
"And now suppose that given Integer.class, I'd like to do this:
final TypeLiteral<Converter<Integer>> typeLiteral = new TypeLiteral<Converter<Integer>>(){};
final Instance<Converter<Integer>> subInstance = converters.select(typeLiteral);
final Converter<Integer> converter = subInstance.get();

This works fine."
"Now, in my actual code, Integer.class is passed in, as a value fulfilling a parameter declared as Class<T>, so what I really have is this:
final TypeLiteral<Converter<T>> typeLiteral = new TypeLiteral<Converter<T>>(){};
final Instance<Converter<T>> subInstance = converters.select(typeLiteral);
final Converter<T> converter = subInstance.get(); // this does not work

The get() call fails with a stack trace that starts with something that looks like the following:

    at org.jboss.weld.bean.builtin.InstanceImpl.get(InstanceImpl.java:105)

What must I do to make this selection succeed?"
One thing I notice is that the stack is reporting that a Converter<T> cannot be found.
"This looks suspicious: I would have expected it to talk in terms of Converter<Integer> instead, since the T ""slot"" is being ""filled"" with Integer.class at runtime, although, to be fair, I did indeed supply a new TypeLiteral<Converter<T>>(){}, not new TypeLiteral<Converter<Integer>>(){}."
"Anyway, all this tells me that TypeLiteral<T> is using T as the type to look for, not the actual value ""filling"" the T ""slot"", and indeed, there is no converter declared as implements Converter<T>, only a converter declared as implements Converter<Integer>, and so I'm worried that what I'd like to do here is fundamentally impossible."
"A:

Creating a TypeLiteral to capture generic parameters only works if those parameters are known at compile time, so new TypeLiteral<Converter<Integer>>(){}."
If the type parameter is not known at compile time then a TypeLiteral cannot capture the parameter information because that information has been removed due to type erasure.
So creating a new TypeLiteral<Converter<T>>(){} actually just creates a new TypeLiteral<Converter<object>>(){}.
This means your select(typeLiteral) will not work as expected since it will receive the type literal for Converter<object>.
"1.. Introduction {#s1}
================

Memory for episodes from one\'s past involves the coordination of multiple brain systems at the time of encoding and again during memory retrieval."
"These include cortical regions that process the components of an episode such as the people that were present, the time the event took place, or the setting in which the episode occurred."
"Structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), most notably the hippocampus, act to bind together these various elements of experience into a coherent episodic memory [@b1],[@b2]."
"This specific episodic memory can then be retrieved in response to a cue from one aspect of the memory, allowing inspection and re-experiencing of the entire original episode."
"Many models of episodic memory include the idea that such remembering involves the reactivation of the brain regions that were initially engaged at the time of encoding, and that this reactivation contributes to the subjective experience of remembering [@b3]--[@b5]."
"Empirical evidence derived from neuroimaging studies of memory retrieval have generally supported this idea, with several studies showing recollection-related reactivation during retrieval [@b6]--[@b10]."
"A potential implication of theories of recollection-related reactivation is that the strength or vividness of the subjective experience of recollection might be a function of the degree of reactivation of cortical regions, though this idea has not been extensively tested."
"The aim of the current study was to investigate perceptual brain regions that are activated during source memory retrieval and how this activation contributes to the remembering of different stimulus types, and how activation in these regions tracks the subjective strength of memory for specific stimulus types."
"Some of the brain regions involved in episodic memory retrieval are engaged in a stimulus-general manner, and contribute to episodic memory regardless of the contents of the memory."
"This is true of the hippocampus, which participates in the binding and retrieval of the elements of episodic memory regardless of stimulus content."
Many neural network models of episodic memory retrieval include the idea that one role of the hippocampus is to reactivate associated memory information through a process of pattern completion [@b11]--[@b14].
The advent of functional neuroimaging methods has provided ways to assess the assumptions of pattern completion and cortical reactivation.
"Studies have generally found that perceptual processing regions that represent the specific kind of associated information tend to be active during memory retrieval in response to a cue, even when the associated information type is not presented [@b7],[@b15]--[@b23]."
"For example, if a word had been encoded accompanied by a picture of an object, presenting the word alone at retrieval will often activate brain regions involved in the perception of object information."
"In addition to the reactivation of perceptual information, studies have also demonstrated effects associated with the reactivation of emotional associations [@b24],[@b25] as well as reactivation of cognitive or strategic processing engaged at encoding [@b10],[@b26],[@b27]."
"Several studies have taken the additional step of linking cortical reactivation effects with the process of recollection, which includes the retrieval of associated information, as opposed to familiarity, which is thought to reflect memory for just the item itself, with the idea that reactivation of associated information is a hallmark of recollection [@b10],[@b20],[@b21]."
The general findings seem to confirm the notion that cortical reactivation is associated with recollection of episodic memory.
"However, there are fewer attempts to investigate how variations in these reactivations might be associated with subjective variations in the strength of recollection or with variations in objective accuracy or specificity of recollection."
Evidence from the behavioral recognition memory modeling literature suggests a graded recollection process and a continuous variation in the memory strength of recollection [@b28]--[@b33].
"Some studies have investigated the specificity of source retrieval [@b28],[@b29] and variations in the amount of retrieved information [@b8],[@b34],[@b35]."
"Previous research has focused on the role of ventral parietal cortex in the strength of recollection, showing that this region is modulated by differences in subjective ratings of the amount of information recollected [@b35],[@b36]."
"The precise function of this parietal region is unclear, though some have suggested that it may play a role in the orienting of attention to reactivated memory representations or may serve as an episodic buffer in working memory [@b34],[@b37]."
"Regardless of the exact function of this region, it appears to be stimulus-general, tracking subjective recollective memory strength regardless of the kind of information being retrieved."
The aim of this study was to investigate how cortical reactivation may vary with the subjective strength of source recollection.
"A few studies have attempted to address this question, and have found evidence that the degree of reactivation of stimulus-specific regions seems to scale with confidence in source memory decisions [@b38], which is often used as a proxy for underlying memory strength."
Studies have also found that source misattributions are associated with reactivation of the incorrect memory content [@b39].
"We sought to contribute additional evidence to these specific questions, taking advantage of the current understanding that distinct brain networks seem to be involved in processing faces and scenes."
"A network of regions including the superior temporal sulcus, amygdala, and fusiform cortex is more active in response to viewing faces than other types of stimuli [@b40]."
"In contrast, scene perception activates a network of brain regions involved in object perception, but one region known as the parahippocampal place area [@b41] seems to be most active to scene stimuli."
These brain regions are also selectively activated during visual imagery of the respective stimulus type [@b42].
"Furthermore, it has also been found that these stimulus-specific brain processing regions can be reactivated during associative memory tasks [@b10],[@b21]."
"We hypothesized that, as has been previously found, stimulus-specific cortical processing regions will be activated in response to associated memory cues during retrieval, including the face-specific and scene-specific regions listed above."
"Specifically, we expected that the magnitude of this cortical activation would be positively related to confidence in memory for the associated information that is not presented during retrieval, but is presumably reactivated in response to a previously associated cue."
"To test this, we showed participants words paired with faces or scenes during encoding."
"At retrieval, just the word was shown and subjects were asked if it had been paired with a face or scene."
"We expected that stimulus-specific processing regions, identified by fMRI localizer scans, would be activated in response to words that had been previously paired with that stimulus type."
"The magnitude of this activation was expected to increase as a function of source memory strength, indexed by subjective confidence in a source memory judgment."
Thus the specific goal of the experiment was to show that subjective confidence in accurate source retrieval should be associated with corresponding increases in activity in stimulus-specific processing regions that represent the type of source information being retrieved.
"2.. Methods {#s2}
===========

2.1.."
"Participants {#s2a}
------------------

Eighteen young adults participated in this study."
The target N of 18 was determined based on a prior unpublished study that examined similar parametric modulations with source confidence.
"The data from 14 participants (6 F; ages 20--35 years old, *M* = 25.6) were included in the analysis."
Data from 4 participants were excluded from analysis due to excessive motion within the MRI scanner (greater than 6mm in any one plane).
"By self-report, all participants were right-handed, had no history of psychiatric or neuropsychological disorders, and were not currently taking any psychotropic medications."
"All subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation in the study, which was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board, and were compensated \$15/hr."
"2.2.. Procedure {#s2b}
---------------

The participants performed a recognition memory experiment with stimuli comprising of words, pictures of faces, and pictures of ""places"" (photographs of scenes), as well as a 1-back localizer task with just pictures."
The words were 754 adjectives between 4 and 10 letters in length (M = 7.3).
The face stimuli were comprised of 300 male and 300 female color photographs faces selected from a face database used in a previous study [@b43].
"There were 720 color photographs of scenes, equally represented by 6 categories (mountains, beaches, cities, forests, highways, and industry) used previously by Walther et al."
[@b44].
"The stimuli were randomly assigned to the practice, memory experiment, and localizer task for each participant, with the condition that there were equal numbers of scenes from each category in each task as well as equal numbers of male and female faces."
"The memory task consisted of a Study phase, which took place outside the MRI scanner, and a Test phase, which was performed within the MRI scanner."
"Prior to the experiment, participants completed a practice version of the entire memory experiment (encoding and source test), consisting of 48 stimuli not used in the remaining experiment."
"During the Study phase, participants studied 504 words randomly presented one at a time beneath a picture of either a face or a scene for 3500ms each, with a 500ms ITI ([Figure 1](#neurosci-06-04-250-g001){ref-type=""fig""})."
"While the stimuli were on the screen, the participant rated how well the word described the picture on a 6-point scale."
"The first and last 2 stimulus pairs were not tested, to mitigate the effects of primacy and recency."
"The participants then entered the MRI scanner to perform the Test Phase, with approximately 30 minutes elapsing between the end of the Study phase and the beginning of the Test phase."
"The Test phase consisted of 500 words that had been previously studied (half with a face, half with a place), and 100 new words that had not been studied at encoding."
During the memory test each word was centrally presented for 2500 ms and participants were instructed to imagine the image that had been previously paired with the word.
"They responded if the word was previously paired with a face or a place image and simultaneously rated their confidence on a scale from one to six (sure face, think face, guess face, guess place, think place, sure place)."
The hands that subjects used to make these six responses were counterbalanced across participants.
Participants were instructed to guess face or place if they saw a word they did not remember seeing before.
"An additional 167.5 seconds of null fixation was randomly interspersed between trials, in 2.5--12.5 second intervals, throughout each block of the test to allow for deconvolution of the hemodynamic response to individual trial types."
The test phase was broken into 6 blocks of 100 randomly selected trials.
"After each block participants were shown how many times they responded sure, think, or guess, regardless of stimulus type or accuracy, and encouraged to use the entire range of the rating scale."
"Following completion of the memory task, participants performed a Localizer task with pictures of faces and places designed to identify face and place specific processing regions of the brain [@b44]."
"To ensure attention to the pictures, participants performed a 1-back test and pressed a button whenever a stimulus was immediately repeated."
The pictures used in the localizer task were randomly chosen from the set of stimuli not used in the memory task.
Each picture was shown for 750 ms with a 250 ms ITI.
Stimuli were presented in 8 blocks.
"Each block consisted of either 12 faces or places, followed by 12 of the other stimulus type, followed by 15 seconds of fixation."
A randomly selected 9 stimuli in each block were shown once and 3 were shown twice.
The order of the blocks was counterbalanced within subjects so that each block had an equal chance of beginning with faces or places and an equal chance of being followed by a block of the same order.

2.3.. fMRI Data Acquisition {#s2c}
---------------------------

Scanning was done using a 3T Siemens Allegra MRI with a 16-channel whole-head coil."
"After a T2-weighted anatomical scan, functional images were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence (TR = 2.5 s, TE = 25 ms, 44 interleaved oblique-coronal slices, 3.4 × 3.4 × 3 mm voxels, no gap, flip angle = 90 degrees, FOV = 220 mm, 274 volumes per run for 6 runs, followed by 152 volumes for one run)."
Oblique-coronal slice acquisition perpendicular to the main axis of the hippocampus was used to minimize susceptibility artifacts in the MTL during fMRI data acquisition.
"Slices were positioned to ensure complete coverage of the occipital lobe, at the expense of excluding the frontal poles for participants for whom whole-brain coverage was not possible."
High-resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical images (1 mm isotropic voxels) were collected after the 6 experimental runs and 1 localizer run.
Head motion was restricted using foam inserts.
Visual stimuli were projected onto a screen behind the subject and viewed through a mirror mounted on the head coil.
Responses were made with handheld button boxes.
"2.4.. fMRI data analysis {#s2d}
------------------------

Data analyses were performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK, [www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk](www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk)) implemented in MATLAB 7.9 (The Mathworks Inc., USA)."
"For each participant, functional images were adjusted for interleaved slice acquisition time and then subjected to affine motion correction."
"T2-weighted anatomical images were co-registered to the mean EPI volume across experimental runs, and high-resolution T1 MPRAGE images were co-registered to the T2-weighted images."
The localizer scan EPI volumes were co-registered to the mean EPI image from the memory runs.
"All functional images were then normalized to the standard template based on the 152-subject MNI reference brain, resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm voxels, and smoothed with an 8mm FWHM Gaussian kernel."
The memory data were concatenated across runs and modeled using a general linear model.
"Event-related fMRI time-series data were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, which was time-locked to the onset of each word."
"These functions were then used as covariates in the general linear model, along with time-derivative basis functions for each condition, regressors for global changes both within and between blocks, and regressors of the motion-correction parameters."
A parametric modulator based upon behavioral source confidence was included to identify brain activity that increased with increasing confidence (low-medium-high).
"Only trials with a correct source memory decision were used for these analyses, such that we could look for variations in activity with variations in source confidence, for accurate source memory only."
Least-square parameter estimates of the peak of the hemodynamic response function for correct face and place responses were calculated and adjusted by their respective parametric modulators.
"The parametric modulators identify regions that increase in activation linearly across the three confidence levels, regardless of where baseline activation falls among the three conditions."
"The average number of trials contributing to the analyses for low, medium, and high confidence source hits was 32, 55, and 56 for faces and 35, 56, and 46 for places."
"The source strength effects were then submitted to one-sample *t* tests at the group level, treating subject as a random effect, and masked by the localizer contrast."
"These analyses are reported at a threshold of *[p]{.ul}* \< 0.05, false-discovery rate corrected, with a 5-contiguous-voxel extent threshold."
"The localizer data was pre-processed in an identical way, and analyzed using a blocked design, contrasting blocks of faces and places."
The data from each block was convolved with the canonical HRF.
At the group level faces and places were contrasted against one another.
"The masks for the memory analysis were generated at a statistical threshold of *[p]{.ul}* \< 0.05, false-discovery rate corrected, with a 5-contiguous-voxel extent threshold."
"In order to fully characterize the patterns of activations at each level of source memory confidence, percent signal change analyses were performed using MarsBar 0.41 for SPM5 [@b45]."
Regions defined by the parametric memory strength analyses were submitted to a finite impulse response time-series analysis for the first eight repetition times (20 sec).
The percent BOLD signal change was calculated for each strength level separately for each ROI.

------------------------

The behavioral data were analyzed using a 2 × 3 (Face/Place × Confidence) repeated-measures ANOVA and are shown in [Figure 2](#neurosci-06-04-250-g002){ref-type=""fig""}."
"Source memory accuracy in terms of percent correct was higher for places than faces overall \[*[F]{.ul}*(1,13) = 4.89, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.046\]."
"However, planned comparisons at each level of confidence individually revealed no difference in accuracy between faces and places \[all *[t]{.ul}*(13) \< 1.48, all *[p]{.ul}* \> 0.161\]."
"There was a main effect of response confidence on accuracy; as confidence increased so did behavioral accuracy \[*[F]{.ul}*(2,26) = 39.71, *[p]{.ul}* \< 0.001\]."
"There was no interaction of response confidence and stimulus type \[*[F]{.ul}*(2,26) = 0.67, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.521\]."
"While response times decreased with increasing confidence \[*[F]{.ul}*(2,26) = 16.41, *[p]{.ul}* \< 0.001\], there was no significant difference in response time between faces and places \[*[F]{.ul}*(1,13) = 1.24, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.286\], and no interaction of stimulus condition and response confidence \[*[F]{.ul}*(2,26) = 1.23, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.309\]."
"The accuracy for low confidence (guess) trials was not significantly above chance for either faces \[54% vs. 50%, *[t]{.ul}*(13) = 2.02, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.064\] or places \[53% vs. 50%, *[t]{.ul}*(13) = 1.38, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.192\]."
"However, accuracy for medium confidence (think) trials was above chance for both faces \[55% vs. 50%, *[t]{.ul}*(13) = 3.96, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.002\] and places \[57% vs. 50%, *[t]{.ul}*(13) = 5.518, *[p]{.ul}* \< 0.001\]."

3.2.. fMRI results {#s3b}
------------------

The analysis involved two stages."
"First, we located stimulus-specific brain activations, face or place, using a localizer task."
"The activations identified in the localizer scans are listed in [Table 2](#neurosci-06-04-250-t02){ref-type=""table""}."
"Second, we identified brain regions more active during the source memory task, when cued with words alone, depending on which stimulus type was associated with the word during encoding (places or faces), and increased in activity with increasing behavioral confidence."
Those regions were masked to only include regions from the localizer scan.
"We then extracted the percent signal change from the regions of overlap between the localizer activations and the memory confidence activations, to look at the activity level for each confidence level individually."
The initial comparison looked for brain regions more active for places than faces that increased as a function of source memory confidence.
"A contrast of places minus faces from the localizer task revealed brain regions more active when viewing places, which was used as a mask for the memory test data."
"We then analyzed correct place trials from the source memory experiment, and identified regions that were parametrically modulated by increasing mnemonic confidence."
The only region with statistically significant activation was the left parahippocampal cortex.
"The percent signal change from this region (peak at x = −30, y = −33, z = −18, *Z* = 4.14, 21 voxels) is plotted in [Figure 3](#neurosci-06-04-250-g003){ref-type=""fig""} for each level of confidence to show the amount of activation in each condition separately."
The same strategy was employed to look for confidence-sensitive face processing regions.
A contrast of faces minus places during the localizer task revealed brain regions more active when viewing faces than places.
These activations were used as a mask for activity from the memory test.
We assessed activation from correct face memory trials that parametrically increased activity with increasing mnemonic confidence.
"The only regions from this analysis were the bilateral amygdalae, shown in [Figure 4](#neurosci-06-04-250-g004){ref-type=""fig""}."
"The percent signal change from these regions (left peak: x = −21, y = −9, z = −15, *Z* = 3.42, 16 voxels; right peak: x = 18, y = −3, z = −15, *Z* = 3.58, 12 voxels) is plotted separately for each level of response confidence."

We also hypothesized that activation of stimulus-specific regions may account for incorrect responses and how the participant responds to novel words."
We examined trials in which the participant responded to the face/place question incorrectly as well as responses to novel words.
"We performed two contrasts, comparing incorrect trials for faces with the incorrect trials of places, and face or place responses to novel words, again masked by regions from the localizer scan."
"There were not enough trials to look at each level of response confidence separately, so low, medium, and high confidence were collapsed together for these analyses."
"We used a more liberal statistical threshold for this more exploratory analysis due to low numbers of trials (*[p]{.ul}* \< 0.001, uncorrected, with a 5-contiguous-voxel extent)."
We found no significant activation for words paired with a place during encoding and incorrectly endorsed as having been paired with a face during the source memory task or for novel words judged as having been paired with a face.
"However, words paired with a face at encoding but incorrectly endorsed as having been paired with a place during the source memory test produced activation in the left parahippocampus (x = −33 y = −27 z = −15, Z = 4.59, 15 voxels)."
"New words for which participants chose ""place"" as the source also elicited parahippocampal activation (x = −30 y = −48 z = −6, Z = 3.53, 7 voxels)."

"Discussion {#s4}
==============

This study examined cortical activation during associative memory retrieval to identify brain regions that support confidence judgments of source memory in stimulus-general and stimulus-specific ways."
We identified stimulus-specific processing regions using a separate localizer task.
We hypothesized that the magnitude of activation of stimulus-specific processing brain regions during a source memory task would scale with confidence for that specific kind of information.
Thus we expected that regions more active for faces or places during our localizer would be increasingly active with increasingly confident source memory of the respective stimulus type.
"We identified brain regions that were more active during correct source memory that increased their activity parametrically with source memory confidence, masked by regions that differed between activations from a face or place localizer task."
"We also examined brain regions whose activity increased with source memory strength, as measured by confidence, in a stimulus-general way, independent of associated stimulus type."
"Finally, we examined the brain response to novel and incorrect words."
"Localizer scans for scene stimuli identified several occipital and temporal regions, including several clusters in the parahippocampal cortex that contribute to scene (place) processing."
"During the source memory task, when participants were correct in remembering that a word had been previously paired with a scene, the parahippocampal cortex increased in activity with increasing behavioral confidence."
This parahippocampal region was within the regions activated in the scene localizer task.
The parahippocampal regions observed in the current study included regions characterized previously as the parahippocampal place area [@b41] as well as more anterior regions.
It should also be noted that a nearby area of parahippocampal cortex was activated in the contrast that identified stimulus-general reactivation effects.
"Parahippocampal cortex is thought to be involved in the representation of context (which naturally includes places), such that the reactivations found in the stimulus-general contrast may reflect reactivation of other aspects of context than what we presented, though this explanation is necessarily speculative."
The activation of this parahippocampal region may also be related to guessing behavior or false source memory on the memory test.
"The parahippocampal cortex was active for incorrect place source memory, words incorrectly judged to have been paired with a place during the memory test but were originally paired with a face during encoding."
The parahippocampal cortex was also active for novel words judged to have been paired with a place.
"The study design did not yield enough trials to look at the contribution of confidence to this effect, so it is unclear how the magnitude of this response relates to confidence."
"We found no evidence of brain regions that contribute in a similar way to incorrect face source memory, words incorrectly judged to have been paired with a face during the memory test but were actually unstudied or paired with a place during encoding."
"This is generally consistent with the idea that increases in activation of stimulus-specific regions is more strongly associated with accurate source memory retrieval, supporting the interpretation that these effects reflect the retrieval of face or place information that was encoded at study."
"However, the analyses of inaccurate source memory and novel word responses were noisier due to smaller numbers of trials, so care is required in interpreting these null effects."
A study specifically designed to examine brain regions that contribute to incorrect source judgments is needed to draw conclusions about the functional significance of these observations and to observe how this activity might interact with confidence.
"The face localizer task revealed activity in several brain regions previously associated with face processing: the right fusiform cortex, right superior temporal sulcus, and bilateral amygdalae [@b40]."
"During retrieval, when participants viewed a word that had been studied with a face, and correctly identified it as such, regions in bilateral amygdala increased in activation with increasing confidence in the ""face"" source memory decision ([Figure 4](#neurosci-06-04-250-g004){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Given the amygdala\'s role in processing emotion, we were concerned that this observed activation reflected the possibility that the words more likely correct in the face condition may have been more emotionally arousing than those in the place condition."
"Thus, we identified words that were more likely to be associated with accurate face source memory than place across subjects."
We obtained the mean arousal ratings for most of the words used in this experiment from a normed database [@b46].
"We found no difference in the emotional arousal ratings between words associated with accurate face source memory compared to accurate scene source memory \[*[t]{.ul}*(355) = 0.66, *[p]{.ul}* = 0.438\]."
"Although we did not collect arousal ratings from the participants in the current study, this provides some evidence against the idea that amygdala activity observed in the current study was due to the emotional content of the words themselves."
Our conclusion is that the amygdala activity observed is related to source memory specific to face processing.
"We expected that activation of regions typically associated with face processing, including fusiform face area (FFA) and superior temporal sulcus (STS), would be associated with face source memory confidence."
"However, those regions were not significantly more active during face source memory than during scene source memory in our parametric analysis."
We followed up our parametric analysis by conducting region of interest analyses of these face-processing regions.
There was no evidence of stimulus-specific activation that increased with source memory confidence in either the FFA or STS.
"It is unclear why these regions, well known to be involved in face processing, did not also show memory-related reactivation effects."
"It may be that top-down reactivation of face memory does not include these regions, or that these regions are reactivated, but not in a way that scales with confidence in source memory."
Another potential explanation is that the sample size used in this study may have been insufficient to detect these potentially weaker effects.
Further study is needed to address these potential explanations.
This study contributes data that supports the idea that activation of stimulus-specific processing regions of the brain support recollection of associated source information.
"The activation of different brain regions during recollection is related to the source memory decision, and increasing activation of these regions scales with increasing confidence."
"The activation of these regions during source memory may be related to false memory of specific stimulus types, although follow-up tests are needed."
"Regions of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and perirhinal cortex all increased their activation with increasing source memory confidence in a stimulus-general way, regardless of the associate stimulus type."
These regions have been previously associated with memory strength [@b47]--[@b49].
"A remaining question of interest is, what type of information is being represented by this cortical activation?"
"Based on the involvement of these regions in visual imagery, we conclude that this activity reflects the recollection of the stimulus that had been studied with the word."
"However, an equally plausible explanation is that the activation represents access of category-level information since that is the only information diagnostic for the source memory decision."
"Brain regions representing ""scene"" information that activate to associated cues may reflect the recollection of the exact scene stimulus that was initially studied."
"Or, it may reflect basic category-level information, such as the spatial information diagnostic of a scene compared to a face, or scene category level information, such as a forest compared to a mountain."
Future experiments will need to discriminate these potential interpretations.

"Forage quantity, quality and depletion as scale-dependent mechanisms driving habitat selection of a large browsing herbivore."
1.
Mechanisms that affect the spatial distribution of animals are typically scale-dependent and may involve forage distribution.
Forage quality and quantity are often inversely correlated and a much discussed trade-off is whether or not to select for high-quality forage at the expense of forage abundance.
This discussion has rarely involved scale-dependence or been applied to Northern browsing herbivores.
"At small spatial scales, browsers are assumed to select for the best quality forage."
"But, as high-quality forage resources are often scarce and may become depleted, coarse-scale habitat selection is assumed to be driven by forage availability."
2.
To evaluate if moose selection for forage quantity and quality is scale-dependent we modelled summer and winter habitat selection of 32 GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) at two spatial scales (landscape-scale vs. within-home range-scale).
We used mixed-effects resource selection functions (RSFs) and landscape-scale forage availability models of six tree species of varying quality for moose.
"We considered silver birch (Betula pendula), downy birch (Betula pubescens."
"), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) as low quality browse species and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), aspen (Populus tremula), willow (Salix spp.)"
as high-quality species.
3.
"As expected, the overall selection patterns for available browse biomass and quality varied across spatiotemporal scales."
"At the landscape-scale, moose selected for habitat with high available browse biomass of low quality species while at the within-home range-scale moose selected for sites with the highest quality browse species available."
"Furthermore, selection patterns during summer remained fairly stable, while during winter, selection at the within-home range-scale switched from sites with high quality to sites with lower quality browse species which suggests depletion of high-quality species."
"Consistent with expectations from seasonal resource depletion, site fidelity (bimonthly home range overlap) was much lower in winter than in summer."
4.
Coarse-scale habitat selection by moose as a function of forage variability revealed a scale-dependent trade-off between available browse quantity and browse quality.
"Moreover, resource depletion changed the winter selection criteria of free-ranging moose and we demonstrate how the behavioural response to such a dynamic process can be inferred from RSFs."

A pilot randomized controlled trial of a self-management group intervention for people with early-stage dementia (The SMART study).
"Self-management equips people to manage the symptoms and lifestyle changes that occur in long-term health conditions; however, there is limited evidence about its effectiveness for people with early-stage dementia."
This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the feasibility of a self-management intervention for people with early-stage dementia.
The participants were people with early-stage dementia (n = 24) and for each participant a caregiver also took part.
Participants were randomly allocated to either an eight-week self-management group intervention or treatment as usual (TAU).
"Assessments were conducted at baseline, three months and six months post-randomization by a researcher blind to group allocation."
The primary outcome measure was self-efficacy score at three months.
Thirteen people with dementia were randomized to the intervention and 11 to TAU.
"Two groups were run, the first consisting of six people with dementia and the second of seven people with dementia."
"There was a small positive effect on self-efficacy with the intervention group showing gains in self-efficacy compared to the TAU group at three months (d = 0.35), and this was maintained at six months (d = 0.23)."
"In terms of intervention acceptability, attrition was minimal, adherence was good, and satisfaction ratings were high."
Feedback from participants was analyzed with content analysis.
"The findings suggest the positive aspects of the intervention were that it fostered independence and reciprocity, promoted social support, offered information, and provided clinician support."
This study has provided preliminary evidence that self-management may be beneficial for people with early-stage dementia.

Turtleboy was in Palmer yesterday as part of our Tour de Turtle bone ride series.
We were driving down some country road when a truck came by and it was spreading sand everywhere.
What a brilliant idea huh?
A preemptive sanding for the inevitable snow that was coming.
"We all remember the disaster that happened after the first two inch snowfall we got a couple weeks ago in Worcester, so I’m sure this time around the City of Worcester, Paul Moosey, and Ed Augustus took extra care to make sure this didn’t happen again."
LOL.
"Apparently Worcester has never heard of the concept of sanding the roads before a storm, because between 5-10 PM there were over 60 car accidents, including hit and runs, property damages, and personal injuries."
"Here’s a couple fun ones that turtle riders sent us:

That’s a seven vehicle crash that occurred on Webster Square."
The person who sent us those pictures was actually in the accident.
"We asked her if it was the fault of bad driving, or the road conditions:

“Oh yeah, it was sheer ice."
It was either hit the light pole or the car.
I went for the car.
Somebody called for the sander.
Pretty sure the cop did.
"Then a random citizen comes down the hill, screaming at the cop that it’s nothing but ice starting a little before Cleveland Ave and the cop needs to go do something about it because people were sliding all over."
The cop said “Do I look like a fucking sander?!
What do you want me to do?
Call the fucking City!” The guy went in the other side of the ride and waved to cars to slow down for a good 10min.
Wish I had gotten that shit on tape!
"The cop was so overwhelmed with the hand full of registrations & licenses he had in his hand, he gave it back to me & said he write the shit up later, because it’s gonna take him half the day to write it all up!"
"A Honda Civic did a nice 180 too, but was lucky nobody was coming down the hill at the time."
He pulled over to the side & crept his way down the hill.
What a fucking mess!!!
"The best part is that 20 minutes later the sander came by:

Oops!!!"
"Yea, you might wanna have the roads sanded BEFORE the snow comes."
Especially since we all knew the snow was coming right at rush hour.
Just a thought.
"Another day, another screw up by the City Manager."

"Seriously, it’s not the city’s fault that people don’t take into consideration that it might be slick outside due to weather conditions."
I have never seen a big city prep the roads before a storm.
I am sure that people would have complained about that too.
I am sure there still would have been accidents because of the stupidity of drivers today.
The weather people warned everyone that it was going to be slippery driving conditions and told everyone to be careful.
I bet half of the cars that caused these accidents didn’t even have snow tires on their vehicles.
"Don’t get me wrong, I am not fond of The City of Worcester’s decisions, they are all a joke to me…but, the carelessness of drivers today, may make changes for tomorrow."
Maybe we should look into bumper padding for the curbside and use them to separate lanes.
Seems like that is less predictable.

"It was my first accident in 17 years of driving, there goes my spotless driving record and hello huge surcharge!"
Thank you Ed Augustus it’s nice to see my tax dollars are going to good use!
"I was going less than 10mph down a hill, it was as slow as i could go riding my breaks, when some knucklehead decided to pull out of his driveway right in front of me, with another idiot up my tailpipe."
As soon as I hit the breaks to avoid plowing into the guy in front of me I lost all control ended up down an embankment into the woods.
I got incredibly lucky that I didn’t roll or hit more than one big tree on my way down.
The thing that bothers me the most is that neither of the other cars that saw me go down into the woods even stopped to see if I was alright.
"I guess that’s the world that we live in now, where people are so afraid to get sued or their name on a document that they don’t care about the consequences of their actions or concern for others at all."
I would never have sued but if i hadn’t gotten so lucky I could still be in the woods at the bottom of that hill until god knows when.
If the accident occurred during the storm you can appeal when you receive the surcharge.
Send in the appeal along with the $50 fee.
Save news clippings from the day of the storm noting the weather/number of accidents.
And grab the police report indicating the road conditions.
Where roads are not treated the accident is considered no fault.
Your surcharge will be reversed on appeal.
Source- experience.
Lol of course the person involved in the accident is going to blame the road.
"Of course the road conditions were terrible… But also, yes, you are a SHITTY DRIVER!"
Just like 90% of this city!
It’s in bad conditions that your bad driving habits catch up to you!
Are there any human brains working at City Hall or is that a graveyard like the rest of the city?
"And after the last snow/ice episode, I would have thought things would have been better????"
Wow….am I really stupid to think some good came out of the last storm…UNBELIEVABLE !
!!!!!
That’s an insane number of accidents given how much notice we’ve had for this weather.
Surrounding towns didn’t have this problem – Grafton was perfectly fine.
It was only when I crossed into Worcester that I had any issues at all because they don’t believe in pretreating apparently.
The cop said “Do I look like a fucking sander?!
What do you want me to do?
"Call the fucking City!”

Every time I start feeling bad for cops and the bum rap they get most of the time …….. this makes me say “F” them."
"Seriously, too many cops have bad attitudes and treat law abiding citizens crappy."
"They are well paid, get gold plated pensions, are pretty much immune from minor to moderate prosecution, and retire early."
"And yes, when I need one I damn well expect they show up, as my tax dollars pay for them."
"Listen, no he didn’t handle it very well but you do his job during that."
"Its stressful, not to mention your radio is probably going off for the other 59 accidents that are occurring all over the city, not to mention burglaries, bums and whatnot."
He was stressed.
I would’ve reacted the same way had I been dealing with the same shit.
He’s right.
He ISNT a sander.
"And if it’s anyone calling for the highway department it’s the dispatcher so call the police so she can do her job by, oh i don’t know, dispatching the call?"
Jesus.
Cops aren’t the only ones with bad attitudes.
It’s self entitled assholes like yourself.
I really doubt the Cop actually said that.
People make shit up all the time about Cops either out of frustration from their current particular situation or just a general distain and contempt for Police more than likely from a previous run in with the law.
This shit happens every day and I would not want to be a Cop in this day and age.
Hey her accident sucks and it is the city’s fault for not making sure she is safe but Worcester Cops are smart enough not to melt down like that.
The Chief of Police would not stand for it (conduct unbecoming) and they would be gone that same day.

They are laced with profanity which tells you everything you need to know about this one.
"When we call the DPW so-called “Customer SERVICE” line, we get shit on."

Calls to 929-1300 are a waste of time -they do nothing.
And are exceptionally rude.
"At 6:30 pm, I had to take my son to work last night at Jillian’s on Grove Street from Plantation Street near Wholly Cannoli and CVS."
"It wasn’t too bad till I got over on Grove Street and slid right through a stoplight because I tried to stop but couldn’t, I laid on my horn and flashed my lights to let the vehicle sitting at the light know I couldn’t get stopped, thankfully they stayed where they were."
"Needless to say, on my way back home, I slowed down to a crawl to make sure I could get stopped when necessary."
"The nightmare really began when I got ready to turn on Grafton Street and climb the small hill heading toward Cumberland Farms and Dunkin Donuts, a semi was having a really hard time getting up the small hill to take the left at the light into the terminal area and traffic was really backed up."
It took him about 10 minutes to climb the small hill slipping and sliding all the way.
"Made it through that area then went around the rotary to Hamilton Street hill and saw several vehicles were about 3/4th’s of the way up and sliding off toward the sidewalk, so I put my Rav4 in low 1 to slowly climb the hill, between the cars sliding everywhere and the stoplight at the top, I barely made it to the top without incident and I was sliding all over the rode even all the way down in low…….our stupid city management needs to learn that just because there isn’t at least 2 inches of snow, doesn’t mean they don’t have to do something to make the roads safe for our citizens to drive on and that a bit of preventative work would go a long ways towards making our roads drivable especially when they know a storm is coming……..shame on you Petty and Agustus!!!"
What happened to your promise to do better this go around???
"The town and state roads were halfway decent, many just wet."
I hit the Worcester line by the old friendlys on rt 9 and it was like a sheet of ice before the light.

The molecular weights of peptides generated from a Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digest of this protein were determined by LSIMS analysis and the two peptides containing the blocked amino-terminus were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry to yield the sequence; N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Glu-Ser-Asp-Lys-Asp-Val-Lys-Tyr-Tyr-Thr-Leu-Glu-Glu.
"Comparison of this sequence with a recently reported cDNA sequence (Dariush et al., 1988) indicates that Gln at position 3 is selectively deamidated, although no other discrepancies were found."
Intact rabbit and bovine trypsin-solubilized cytochrome b5 were also analyzed by LSIMS on a high-field mass spectrometer equipped with a diode array detector.
"Mass measurement of the unresolved protonated molecular ion peak tops gave average molecular weights of 9462.2 +/- 2 and 9502.3 +/- 2 for bovine and rabbit trypsin-solubilized cytochrome b5, respectively."
"In both cases, these molecular weights correspond to a cytochrome b5 fragment consisting of amino acids Asp(7)-Arg(88)."
"The average molecular weight for the rabbit amino-terminal-blocked form of trypsin-solubilized cytochrome b5 was found to be 10,144.5 +/- 2, which was consistent with the molecular weight predicted for the extended N-acetylated form (residues 1-88) of Mr 10,146.1."

Capcom held its Marvel vs Capcom 3 launch party last night at the Mezzanine in San Francisco and I decided to stop by.
"I was expecting a few kiosks, but instead, I was greeted with a huge party that featured… Continue Reading →

Along with MvC3 playable at different stations, Capcom also had Super Street Fighter 4 playable on the Nintendo 3DS."
"I had a quick hands-on with the game, and it works well."
There were two perspectives: normal (the traditional side view) and dynamic which puts the camera over the shoulder of your fighter.
"It shows off the game’s 3D visuals, which are gorgeous."
What was interesting is that the touchscreen was used for instant special moves.
All you had to do was press the touchscreen to toss out a hadoken or hit the Ultra button to bust out an ultra.
My one gripe and worry is that the analog nub wasn’t holding up well on the system and could be an issue.
It got stuck in the up position and made my fighter jump repeatedly.
Not good.
I stuck with the D-pad below.
"Overall, the 3D doesn’t do too much for the gameplay except make it look really good."
"For the full effect, you have to be staring straight at it, but that wasn’t too much of a problem."
Seeing the Nintendo 3DS again makes me want the system more.
March 27 can’t come soon enough.
"Thunder blow out Golden State 123-95

Dennis Schröder scored 32 points, 16 in each half, as the Oklahoma City Thunder blew out the dumpster fire that has become the Golden State Warriors 123-95."
Oklahoma City improves to 11-6 on the season.
They’ve now won 11 of their last 13 games.
That’s the best record over that span in the NBA.
"The Thunder after losing their first four games of the post-KD era, are now 3-2 against the Warriors, including going 2-1 in Oakland."
Oklahoma City’s 28-point win is the largest vs. the Warriors in Thunder history.
Largest loss for Golden State20 points and 11 rebounds and two steals.
"at Oracle since Oct. 2016

Schröder’s first half was a large part in why the Thunder were able to hold such a big first half lead."
"The Thunder’s backup point guard had 16 points in the first half, including 10 straight in the second quarter, fueling Oklahoma City back into the lead."
The Warriors actually led 31-29 against the Thunder with 8:55 left in the second quarter.
That’s where Schröder and Co. found their rhythm and took the lead back for good in the half.
Oklahoma City would outscore the Warriors 31-15 for the remainder of the quarter and the Warriors didn’t know what hit them.
Oklahoma City led 60-46 at the break.
It’s the second worst home deficit at halftime by the Warriors in the Steve Kerr era.
The Warriors made their run in the third quarter but the Thunder were able to keep them at arm’s length.
Golden State was as close as four but that was it.
"A lot of that was Paul George, Russell Westbrook and Schröder."
"While Westbrook didn’t shoot well, he did everything else right and that led to open shots for everyone else."
"Westbrook, even when he’s shooting poorly, he commands a lot of attention."
"With 7:17 left in the fourth quarter, Hamidou Diallo pulled down a rebound but landed awkwardly and was carried off the court on a stretcher."
The rookie out of Kentucky has been such a bright spot for the Thunder.
The status of his injury is unknown but was seen in a wheelchair inside the Thunder’s locker room.
The Thunder led 96-85 when Diallo went down.
The Thunder responded to their fallen teammate by icing the game.
The Thunder would outscore the Warriors 27-10 over the final seven minutes of the game.
Paul George finished with 25 points on 10-of-23 shooting.
"He also finished with nine rebounds, five assists and two steals."
Westbrook had his first triple-double of the season.
He’s now only two rebounds away from passing Jason Kidd for third all-time in career triple-double totals.
"Steven Adams faced double teams all night long, finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds and two steals."
"Oklahoma City’s 61 rebounds is the most since Feb. 6, 2017, a 61-rebound performance against Indiana."
The Oklahoma City Thunder will take Thanksgiving off but then will host Kemba Walker and the Charlotte Hornets in the first night of a back-to-back on Friday night.
Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. That game can be followed on our social media posts.
You can view the game on Fox Sports Oklahoma.
"Keys to the Game

Defend: A

The Warriors made less than 25 percent of their threes."
They only made two-thirds of their free throws.
They shots less than 44 percent from the field.
"Outside of a big stretch in the third quarter, Oklahoma City’s defense was nothing but dominant tonight."
It was everything the Thunder needed and more.
"Free Throws: F

It’s not a good thing usually when you make more three-pointers than you do free throws."
Oklahoma City made almost as many threes as the Thunder attempted free throws.
It also didn’t help the Thunder only made 8-of-15 from the line.
That’s unacceptable.
"Efficiency: B+

I want to really give this a C but you know how well they Thunder played throughout the night?"
They shot 48 percent from the field and 37 from behind the arc.
"Oklahoma City, largely in part led by Schröder, did what they needed against the Warriors."
"Without Draymond Green anchoring the defense, the Warriors had no real answer for anything the Thunder threw at them."
"Q:

Week over week change of status using SQL

I am trying to write a SQL which will give me the count of users who's status changed over the period of week over week."
For e.g.
User_id 1 has a status of 1 on week_end_dt of '2020-01-04' and then the status changed to 0 for the next week_end_dt.
"So for the first week all the 4 user's had status 1, hence the count would be 4."
"For the next week, except for user 3 rest changed their status, hence the count would be 1."
So on and so forth.
"Output
week_end_dt  count_changed_0_1    count_change_1_0
2020-01-04        4                        0

A:

Assuming you have data for every week (no gaps) as in your sample data, you can use lag() and aggregation like this:
select week_end_dt,
       sum(case when prev_status = status then 0 else 1 end) as num_changes
from (select us."
"*, lag(status) over (partition by user_id order by week_end_dt) as prev_status
      from user_status us
     ) us
group by week_end_dt
order by week_end_dt;

"The Soccernet Quiniela - Week Five - Group Therapy

After 14 La Liga weeks, we already have a decent pool of hard data that allows us to group teams into clusters with similar behaviour."
"These clusters should provide us with insight to build our quinielas, and together with our Commandments should combine for a killer prediction tool."
"For instance, there's one group of teams that we could call the Pony and Trap Club (unfamiliar with cockney rhyming slang?"
Let's just say they're not very good).
"Proud members include Xerez, Málaga, Zaragoza, Almería and Espanyol."
"You can safely predict defeat as their default result unless they play against each other, in which case 'X' is a pretty safe bet."
"However, pay close attention to them, as at least one of these sides will undergo a resurrection in the second half of the season."
"A second cluster, the Adulterers, prefers to play away from home: Sevilla, Valencia, Athletic, Deportivo and even Real Madrid (more on this one later on) belong to this category."
"Whenever they are the visiting side, '2' is a more than good option, but you should be cautions when they play at home, even against theoretically inferior opposition."
"In stark contrast, Mallorca, Sporting and Tenerife (aka the Loyal Husbands), enforce their home-field advantage, but have difficulties getting points away from home and, in my humble opinion, have overachieved so far."
"Their squads are short and they should suffer a slump in the second half of the season (married life will do that to you eventually, or so they say)."
"Then we have the Late Bloomers, teams that have improved following a dubious start and should have a better second half of the season: Villarreal, Racing and Getafe all fit into this fellowship."
They'll probably attract new members after the winter transfer window closes.
"The following group, the Question Marks, sometimes give you the impression that they should be doing better, but then you also feel that they could collapse at any point in time."
"Mighty Atlético, Osasuna and Valladolid belong here."
"And finally, we have Juggernauts Barcelona, who while not at the same level as last year, have learned to win even when they don't play well."
That is probably why last week's quiniela wasn't really a surprising one.
One of my readers achieved a record eight correct results and demanded recognition.
"Dear quinielaers, I'm afraid you'll have to get a perfect ten to get mentioned in this column."
"I got a reasonable six, and none of the results I missed seemed shocking or far-fetched."
"Now that we know all this, are we ready to go after the perfect ten?"
"As usual, it's '1' for a home win, 'X' for a draw and '2' for an away win."
1.
Valladolid (13th) - Sporting (9th): 2.
"Kings of the draw Valladolid (seven stalemates in 14 matches, including their last three) entertain one of the Loyal Husbands (one win in seven away matches for Sporting)."
"It looks like a potential win for the pucelanos, but here is why we need to do our weekly homework religiously: Valladolid will sorely miss three core players (striker Diego Costa, midfielder Borja and legendary left full-back Marcos) due to suspensions and injury."
"Having that in mind, this is a unique testing ground for Sporting to learn how to win away from home."
"Making the most of easy chances is how Loyal Husbands become great Adulterers (again, this is just word of mouth)."
2.
Sevilla (3rd) - Getafe (8th): 1.
Quiniela-busters Sevilla have one more chance to redeem themselves.
Remember their draws against Málaga and Valladolid?
"This time they play a much better side, Getafe, who have won three of their last four."
"However, four Getafe starters (striker Soldado, midfielders Casquero and Celestini and defender Cortés) won't be able to play on Sunday."
Sevilla cannot fail to win this match.
"They just can't (yes, I am trying to talk myself into this)."
3.
Tenerife (12th) - Atlético (14th): 1.
"Atlético's gaffer Quique Sánchez Flores after last week's home defeat to Villarreal: ""The worst is yet to come""."
I didn't mistype that quote.
"Quique wasn't confusing ""best"" and ""worst"", nor was he trying to imitate Frank Sinatra."
He firmly believes that things will get even worse for Atlético.
Who am I to argue?
4.
Villarreal (10th) - Racing (15th): 1.
Two Late Bloomers face to face.
"In this case I'll go with Villarreal making the most of their home-field advantage (Commandment #4: when in doubt, '1')."
"The yellow machine is slowly getting some traction, and should be back in the European spots by the end of January."
Side note: can we get odds on Nicola Zigic leaving Valencia in the winter transfer window and going to Racing for the third time?
"This deal has worked so well for all parties involved in the past, why not do it again?"
5.
Xerez (20th) - Barcelona (1st): 2.
"Yes, I do follow La Liga and am well aware of the fact that this match was actually played two weeks ago, due to Barça's trip to Abu Dhabi for the Club World Cup."
The blaugranas won 2-0.
"However, I feel absolutely entitled to act as if I knew nothing about that, make my own prediction (a '2', of course) and even pretend I'm happily surprised by the result on Sunday."
"After all, last week I announced that this column would ride Barça until the end of the season, and I wouldn't have thought of any outcome other than a '2' for a match in which the President of the Pony and Trap Club hosts the Juggernaut."
"And if you didn't see this one coming... well, you don't know me well enough."
6.
Espanyol (17th) - Almería (16th): 1.
Here's when clusters and Commandments collide.
"According to the former, a match between two members of the Pony and Trap Club should end up in a draw."
"Applying the latter, 'You shall ride negative streaks unless an extreme event happens', no La Liga streak is worse than Espanyol's."
"The periquitos have lost their last five, and have not scored a single goal in that spell."
"However, one could argue that, judging by the uproar among Espanyol's players, fans and executives, last week's defeat at the Camp Nou could have a galvanising effect, becoming the extreme event that changes Espanyol's fortunes."
"The Almería camp is hardly quiet either: on Wednesday, President Alfonso García Gabarrón said that he ""can't say for sure that Hugo [Sanchez] will keep his job much longer""."
"Let's solve this the easy way: Commandment #4 states that ""When in doubt, you shall pick 1""."
End of story.
7.
Deportivo (6th) - Valencia (4th): 1.
"In an interesting contest for the fourth spot (Champions League territory), a Loyal Husband plays host to an Adulterer."
"Valencia have won their last five away matches, which makes them the Julian (Richard Gere's character in ""American Gigolo"") of La Liga."
"However, the valencianistas have a tough midweek Europa League match at Genoa, right after their draining home defeat against Real Madrid."
Depor will play against a worn out ché side dying to go on their Christmas break.
'1' looks good here.
8.
Real Madrid (2nd) - Zaragoza (18th): 1.
"While the overly optimistic Madrid media are already celebrating the best Real Madrid side of all time - on Monday, Marca's Santiago Segurola said that ""Pellegrini has built the most exciting Real Madrid team in the last decade"" - call me stubborn, but I still have my reservations."
"Despite their impeccable La Liga home record, Real Madrid have not played a single consistent match at the Bernabéu yet."
"Their brightest moments have all happened away (Camp Nou, Marseille and Valencia), thus the 'Adulterer' tag."
I need to see more to believe they will deliver in their home deeds.
"And talking about beliefs: if you don't consider yourself superstitious, I'll make you think twice about that."
"Last Saturday, Pepe gave an interview to El País in which he mentioned that he was extremely happy to have broken what he called ""the Real Madrid centre-back curse""."
"According to Pepe, no merengue player had been able to occupy the centre-back position consistently following the retirement of Fernando Hierro."
That was until Kleper Laverian 'Pepe' arrived in Madrid.
"He was the Chosen One, the new centre-back Messiah."
"The night after this interview, Pepe damaged the ligaments in his right knee against Valencia, and is out for six months."
"Note to Ezequiel Garay and Raúl Albiol: keep your mouths shut, please."
"After one point in five matches, visitors Zaragoza decided to fire boss Marcelino García Toral."
"His temporary replacement, José Aurelio Gay, is a former Real Madrid and Zaragoza player, so it should be an emotional debut... except for the highly likely thumping the maños will suffer."
"I'll be watching this one from the Bernabéu's Palco Presidencial (the Presidential Box, no less), don't ask me how."
"Plenty of gossip guaranteed next Thursday...

9."
Athletic (7th) - Osasuna (11th): 1.
"Osasuna are already showing signs of exhaustion, and we haven't even reached the halfway point of the season."
"The winter break should help them to recover some of their spark, but until then, I don't see them getting too many points and even less so against a hungry-for-European-spots Athletic at the San Mamés."
10.
"Málaga (19th) - Mallorca (5th): X.

I know I have mentioned Gregorio Manzano's annual salary before (1.8 million euros), but now I'll give you some additional data: not even one single Mallorca player makes anywhere close to that amount."
How many coaches make more money than all of their players?
"Not even The Special One, José Mourinho, has gone this far."
And I don't think a single Mallorca fan disagrees with this.
"Mallorca are on a roll (only one defeat in their last eight matches, and it was at Camp Nou), while Málaga have not won since the first match of the season."
Will they break the spell?
Don't think so.
Not against 'Professor Apple Tree' (Manzano).

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a press conference following a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York.
"During the press conference, Lavrov Commented on the situation in Syrian Afrin, denying that Russia had withdrawn troops from the city."
Turkish news agency Anadolu previously reported that Russian military had been leaving Afrin.
"Turkey has been threatening to launch an operation in Afrin since last week, after the US announced its decision to start training a border protection force composed of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which has been described by Ankara as a ""terrorist army."""
"On January 19, the operation de facto started."
"Later, Lavrov proceeded with the explanation of how the terrorists attacked the Russian military base in Hmeymim, Syria on December 31."
"""There has to be 23-24 observer posts in Turkey, and unfortunately a lack of such posts in Idlib has become the reason for the terrorist attack on the Hmeymim base."""
The non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was on the agenda of the UN Security Council meeting on January 19.
"Commenting on President Donald Trump's accusations against Russia, who blames Moscow for preventing the resolution of the North Korean issue and allegedly supplying Pyongyang with fuel in violation of international sanctions, Sergei Lavrov said:

""If the United States does not file complaints about non-implementation of the sanctions against North Korea, it means that Washington does not have evidence."""
"The Russian Foreign Minister added that Moscow was ready for dialogue with Washington, despite claims that the US faced growing threats from revisionist powers, including Russia and China, as outlined in the new National Security Strategy of the United States."
"""We regret that the US aspires to assert its leadership, issuing such strategies and concepts, naming Russia and China as threats in its defense strategy, instead of opting for a constructive dialogue based on international law,"" said Lavrov."
"The document describes Russia as a country that is ""now undermining the international order from within the system by exploiting its benefits while simultaneously undercutting its principles and ""rules of the road."""
"Russian Foreign Minister nonetheless expressed hopes that the United States would eventually realize the need to develop relations with Moscow, including in the security sphere."
"""Improving relations between Washington and Moscow depends on President Trump's ability to tackle the russophobe intrigues."""
"When asked about the US role in the Middle East, Lavrov said that the US decision to withhold UN funding for Palestinians ""undermined in a serious way"" efforts to meet the needs of refugees."
"""This decision… undermines in a serious way the efforts to satisfy the needs of Palestinian refugees in the region,"" Lavrov said through a translator."
"""We'll consult all stakeholders and we'll see what we can do."""
"Earlier this week Washington announced its decision to pay the UN Relief and Works Agency $60 milion, but put on hold the payment of another $65 million it had been expected to offer, with the US Department of State refusing to provide an additional $45 million in food aid it had promised for Palestinians."
"The minister noted that Russia was planning meetings with the heads of Israel and Palestine, offering Mahmoud Abbas and Benjamin Netanyahu to meet on Russian soil."
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the Iran nuclear deal could not survive if any side withdrew from the agreement.
"""This agreement cannot be implemented if one of the participants unilaterally steps out of it."
"It will fall apart, there will be no deal then,"" Lavrov told reporters."
"He elaborated that the deal was not dead yet, and Russia would put in much effort to preserve it."
"Furthermore, Lavrov said that Moscow had received information, according to which, the United States would try to convince the EU to change its stance on the deal."
"Meanwhile, he added that ""Washington's demands related to the nuclear deal with Iran would be inadmissible for Tehran,"" and noted that renegotiating the deal has no prospects."
"Last week US President Donald Trump said that if the ""disastrous flaws"" of the 2015 multilateral accord to curb Iran's nuclear program were not fixed within 120 days, then Washington would step out."
"Russia believes that there is no need to blame Iran for everything that happens in the Middle East, and considers it impossible to isolate Tehran from any issues related to the region."
"As for the Syrian talks, Lavrov said that during the last tour of negotiations, the opposition's delegation started demanding regime change even before the talks started."
The minister added that he hoped this will not happen during the next round of negotiations in Vienna.

"*382 Michael M. Rubbinaccio, Butler, for the State."
"Steven K. Greene, Joseph T. Maccarone and Sohail Mohammed, appeared as Amici Curiae."
"STANTON, A.J.S.C."
"BACKGROUND
This supplementary proceeding involves the reliability of a device known as the LTI Marksman 20-20 Laser Speed Detection System manufactured by Laser Technology, Inc. For ease of expression, I shall hereafter usually refer to this device as the ""laser speed detector"" or the ""detector."""
"The laser speed detector is a compact, hand-held device which the New Jersey State Police desire to use in enforcing the laws regulating motor vehicle speeds."
"In 1996, in connection with a number of motor vehicle speeding cases which were then pending in the municipal courts of Rockaway Township and Parsippany-Troy Hills Township, I conducted an extensive evidentiary hearing in the Superior Court for Morris County on the admissibility of speed readings obtained by the New Jersey State Police through use of the laser speed detector."
"In that earlier proceeding, Michael M. Rubbinaccio, Esq., who was then serving as the Municipal Prosecutor for both Rockaway Township and Parsippany-Troy Hills Township appeared for the State."
"Stephen K. Greene, Esq., Joseph T. Maccarone, Esq."
"and Sohail Mohammed, Esq."
appeared as attorneys for various defendants in the motor vehicle cases then pending in the municipal court.
"On June 13, 1996, I issued a written opinion in that matter which concluded that the general concept of using lasers to measure speed is widely accepted in the relevant scientific community and is valid."
"However, I was not satisfied that it had been proven that the laser speed detector device was accurate and reliable enough to be used for law enforcement purposes."
"My principal reason for not accepting the laser speed detector was that there had not been, in my view, adequate *383 operational testing of the laser speed detector under actual highway conditions."
My view was that good performance testing might conceivably put us in a position of being sure that the detector in fact worked reliably.
I suggested that it would be relatively easy to design performance tests which would let independent observers know how accurate the laser detector device was.
"I suggested that the tests should include vehicles of varying sizes and shapes, that they be conducted under various conditions of traffic flow along actual highways and roads, and that they be conducted at different times of day under varying climatic conditions."
I noted that such tests should involve target vehicles whose speed was reliably established either by controlling the driver of the vehicle or through simultaneous measurement of its speed by a reliable device other than the laser speed detector.
"I further noted that the test data would have to be accurately recorded and reproduced for examination, analysis and replication by other persons and agencies."
The State did not take an appeal from my decision excluding evidence generated by the laser speed detector.
The various cases then pending in the municipal courts were resolved without the use of laser speed detector evidence.
"However, the State did attempt to conduct performance testing of the detector in an effort to develop data which would permit a reexamination of the admissibility of speed readings produced by the detector."
"Accordingly, the New Jersey Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Data Development, in cooperation with the New Jersey State Police, Division of Highway Traffic Safety, conducted field testing of the laser speed detector during September, October and November of 1996 and June and July of 1997."
"Closed track testing of the detector was conducted on September 19, 1996."
"In 1997, the State moved to have me reopen the evidentiary proceedings involving the laser speed detector."
"By that time, the pending motor vehicle cases had been resolved and there were no defendants who had an interest in contesting the admissibility of readings from the detector."
"However, in view of the fact that the State Police were interested in using the detector and were prepared to attempt to justify the admissibility of readings produced by the detector on the basis of the field testing which had occurred, it seemed to me that it would be desirable for any proceeding to take place in this court in a way which would allow the parties to build upon evidence which had been presented during the 1996 hearings before me."
"Although I thought it useful and in the public interest to try to build on the earlier proceedings, I did not want to have a non-adversarial proceeding before me because such a proceeding would not be likely to produce an appropriately vigorous scrutiny of the data presented."
"Fortunately, Mr. Greene, Mr. Maccarone and Mr. Mohammed, attorneys who had represented defendants in the earlier proceedings, remained interested in the issues involved and they agreed to appear as amici curiae and to present evidence and argument designed to subject any data presented by the State to meaningful scrutiny."
"Although Mr. Greene, Mr. Maccarone and Mr. Mohammed consented to act as friends of the court on an uncompensated basis, I did enter an order on July 8, 1997, requiring the State to cover the reimbursement of defense expert fees and costs."
"In this way, we were able to make it possible to evaluate the test data generated by the State on an adversarial basis."
"I refer to the Opinion which I issued on June 13, 1996 for a detailed description of the laser speed detector and of the operational and conceptual objections which were raised in opposition to its acceptance."
I incorporate herein by reference everything which I said in that earlier opinion without repeating it in detail.
"However, I do think it useful to repeat at this point a general description of the way in which the laser speed detector is supposed to work:
A laser is an artificially generated and amplified light which is in the infrared light section of the electromagnetic wave spectrum."
It is not visible to the naked eye.
It is very concentrated.
The laser speed detector fires a series of laser pulses *384 at a selected remote target.
"When the laser light strikes the target, a portion of the light is reflected back to the detector."
"Since the speed of light is a known constant, by measuring the time it takes for the laser pulse to travel to the target and back, the detector is able to calculate the distance between the detector and the target."
Each laser pulse which is fired and reflected back establishes one distance reading.
The laser speed detector fires 43 laser pulses every time the trigger on the detector is squeezed.
These 43 pulses are fired in a total period of approximately one-third of a second.
"If the target at which the laser pulses are fired is a stationary target, each of the 43 pulses will give the same distance reading to the target, and distance will be the only thing that the detector can tell us about the target."
"However, if the target is moving, each of the 43 pulses will give a slightly different distance reading and the detector can then compute the velocity or speed of the target from the changes in distance divided by the known elapsed time between the firing of each of the laser pulses."
"In simplest terms, this is the basic theory underlying the use of lasers to calculate speed, and there can be no dispute about its fundamental validity."
"THE STANDARD
In February, 1995, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States Department of Transportation issued Model Minimum Performance Specifications for Lidar Speed Measurement Devices."
The laser speed detector is a lidar device.
The specifications require that the speed measurements produced by the device shall not exceed true speed by more than one mile per hour or underreport speed by more than two miles per hour.
"True speed is a somewhat philosophical concept, since any measuring device is susceptible to some amount of error."
"For practical purposes, the inquiry into whether a particular device meets the standard specified has to be determined by comparing the device in question to other devices whose reliability is generally accepted."
"Since we are dealing in speed law enforcement cases with efforts to convict motorists of speeding violations, the more significant aspect of the standard is that we do not want a device to over-report speed by more than one mile per hour."
"CLOSED TRACK TESTING
Closed track testing of the laser speed detector was conducted at Raceway Park in Englishtown on September 19, 1996."
Four standard passenger automobiles supplied by the State Police were driven on the track on controlled speed ranges varying from 90 miles to 20 miles per hour.
"The vehicles were clocked simultaneously by the track timer, by K-55 radar, by a device known as the PEEK 241 recorder and by the laser speed detector."
The track timer used was a Compulink System III which used infrared detectors designed to calculate miles per hour over a 66-foot speed trap.
It is certified by various international automobile racing organizations.
K-55 radar is widely used by police departments throughout New Jersey for law enforcement purposes and has been accepted as reliable by New Jersey courts for more than 18 years.
The PEEK 241 recorder is a portable traffic monitoring device which is used in New Jersey and in many other states by state highway departments to determine traffic volumes and speeds.
It is not used for law enforcement purposes against individual motorists.
It determines vehicle speed by calculating the time required for a vehicle to activate two road hoses placed a known distance apart.
"In the closed track testing at Raceway Park, the laser speed detector was activated approximately 50% of the time against approaching vehicles and approximately 50% of the time against vehicles which were pulling away from the operator of the detector."
The laser speed detector and the track timer measured vehicles simultaneously on 114 occasions.
The speed reading produced by the laser speed detector exceeded that produced by the track timer by more than one mile per hour in only one case.
The reading in question was two miles per hour higher than the track timer.
The laser speed detector and the PEEK 241 measured the same vehicles simultaneously on 234 occasions.
The measurements produced by the laser speed detector *385 never exceeded the measurements produced by the PEEK 241 recorder by more than one mile per hour.
The laser speed detector and the K-55 radar measured vehicles simultaneously on 210 occasions.
The measurements produced by the laser speed detector never exceeded the measurements produced by the radar by more than one mile per hour.
The laser speed detector showed a slight bias towards underreporting speed when compared with each of the other measuring devices.
"HIGHWAY TESTINGRADAR
On October 1, 1996, State Police officers deployed K-55 radar and the laser speed device on Interstate 80 in Mount Olive Township, Morris County."
The officers deploying the devices were appropriately trained and certified and took positions on either the shoulder or the median of the highway which would be used in standard law enforcement operations.
The radar and the laser speed detector were used simultaneously against 300 vehicles which happened to be traveling along the highway at varying speeds and at varying distances.
The measurements produced by the laser speed detector exceeded the measurements produced by the K-55 radar by more than one mile per hour on one occasion.
"On that occasion, the laser reading was two miles per hour higher than the radar reading."
"On November 6, 1996, K-55 radar and the laser speed device were again used simultaneously by appropriately trained State Police officers on Interstate 80 in Mount Olive Township."
The officers again took up standard law enforcement positions and deployed the devices against 599 vehicles traveling along the highway at varying speeds and ranges.
Most of the vehicles measured simply happened to be traveling along the highway.
"However, a marked State Police car with a calibrated fifth wheel speed measuring device was operated along the highway on 51 occasions during that test."
The measurements produced by the laser speed device exceeded the measurements produced by the radar by more than one mile per hour on one occasion.
"In that instance, the laser speed detector showed a reading five miles per hour higher than the measurement produced by the radar."
"On the 51 occasions on which the laser measured the speed of the State Police vehicle equipped with the fifth wheel, the laser speed detector never exceeded the measurement produced by the fifth wheel."
"In the highway testing against radar, the laser speed detector showed a slight bias towards underreporting speed."
The laser speed detector also showed a slight (but more pervasive) bias towards underreporting as compared to the fifth wheel.
"If we combine the closed track testing results and the highway testing results for a comparison of K-55 radar and the laser speed detector, we have 1,109 cases in which radar and the laser speed detector measured the speed of vehicles simultaneously."
In only two cases did the speed measurement produced by the laser speed detector exceed the measurement produced by radar by more than one mile per hour.
The closed track testing took place during daylight hours in fair weather.
The highway testing of the laser speed detector as compared to radar also took place in daylight hours during fair weather.
"As previously noted, during the closed track testing, the laser speed device was deployed against approaching vehicles approximately one-half of the time and against vehicles pulling away approximately one-half of the time."
"In the highway testing, the laser speed detector was deployed against approaching vehicles on 599 occasions and against vehicles pulling away on 300 occasions."
"Very few measurements were taken at ranges of more than 1,000 feet."
"HIGHWAY TESTINGWIM SYSTEM
On a number of days in September and October of 1996, the laser speed detector was tested against piezoelectric Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) systems which were owned and operated by the New Jersey Department of Transportation."
"These systems are manufactured by International Road Dynamics, Inc. and are used by the Department of Transportation in connection with federally mandated systems to monitor the weight of trucks."
"In addition to recording vehicle weight, the systems also record vehicle speeds."
The WIM systems employ various *386 sensors imbedded in the highway pavement and are not apparent to a motorist.
"In the WIM systems used in New Jersey, the sensor array usually consists of one upstream loop followed by two downstream piezoelectric cable sensors."
The upstream loop alerts the system to the entry of a vehicle.
The downstream sensors measure vehicle speed by determining the time it takes for a vehicle to pass between the two sensors.
"Since the distance between the sensors is a known quantity, vehicle speed can be readily calculated by the electronic package attached to the system."
The WIM systems used in the test were calibrated against K-55 radar.
The laser speed detector was positioned at a fixed distance from the WIM system for each testing session.
"The fixed distance was changed from session to session and varied from 500 feet at the closest range to 1,000 feet at the longest range."
The laser speed detector system was operated by a trained State Police officer who positioned himself either on the median or the shoulder of the highway in a position comparable to that which he would assume in normal law enforcement operations.
The laser speed detector was deployed against vehicles happening to pass along the highway at the same time at which they passed through the WIM system.
"The WIM system was deployed in only one lane at a time, and the lane was varied from testing session to testing session."
"The laser speed detector was compared against the WIM system on Interstate 80 in Knowlton Township, Warren County and on Interstate 95 in Ewing Township, Mercer County."
The speeds of a total of 799 vehicles were calculated simultaneously by the WIM system and the laser speed detector.
"Test results were not affected by whether the vehicles being measured were in the slow lane, the center lane or the fast lane of the highway."
Three hundred forty-five vehicles were measured in daylight during fair weather.
In five cases the speed measurement produced by the laser speed detector exceeded the measurement produced by the WIM system by more than one mile per hour.
"In each of those five cases, the laser speed detector reading was two miles per hour higher."
The speeds of 304 vehicles were measured simultaneously at night time in fair weather.
In no case where readings were taken after dark did the measurement produced by the laser speed detector exceed the measurement produced by the WIM system by more than one mile per hour.
The WIM system and the laser speed detector were simultaneously used against 150 vehicles during daytime when moderately heavy rain was falling.
"In nine cases, the speed measurement produced by the laser speed detector exceeded the measurement produced by the WIM system by more than one mile per hour."
"In six of those nine cases, the laser speed detector reading was two miles per hour higher."
"In three of those nine cases, the laser speed detector reading was three miles per hour higher."
"As stated above, a total of 799 vehicles were measured simultaneously by the WIM system and the laser speed detector."
"In 14 cases out of this total group, the measurement produced by the laser speed detector exceeded the measurement produced by the WIM system by more than one mile per hour."
The figure for readings in excess of one mile per hour is markedly higher for the WIM system comparison than for the comparison between the laser speed detector and radar.
"Despite that, even with respect to the WIM system, the laser speed detector showed a bias towards underreporting of speed."
"Indeed, even with respect to measurements taken in the rain (where there were nine readings which were more than one mile per hour higher on the laser speed detector), there was a very slight bias on average in the direction of underreporting of speed."
I note that the highway testing of the laser speed detector in comparison both to the WIM system and to K-55 radar involved a complicated mix of motor vehicles which happened to be driving along the highway sections where tests were being conducted.
"There were all sorts of passenger motor vehicles, vans, sports utility vehicles, and many types of trucks."
Speed readings were not affected by the type of vehicle whose speed was being measured.
"*387 GENERAL RESULTS OF SPEED MEASUREMENTS

Taking an overview of the data on speed measurements, as compared to radar, the laser speed detector produced an identical reading a little more than 65% of the time, a non-identical reading within the range of -2 miles per hour to +1 mile per hour a little more than 34% of the time, and a reading outside the range of -2 miles per hour to +1 mile per hour a little less than ½ of 1% of the time."
"Thus, the readings were within the range required by the Model Minimum Performance Specifications of the National Highway Safety Administration 99.5% of the time."
"As compared to the WIM system, the laser speed detector produced an identical reading a little more than 40% of the time, a non-identical reading in the range of -2 miles per hour to +1 mile per hour a little more than 56% of the time, and a reading outside the range of -2 miles per hour to +1 mile per hour a little more than 3% of the time."
"Thus, the readings were within the range required by the Model Minimum Performance Specifications approximately 96.5% of the time."
......
There were no tests conducted in cold winter weather.
"However, the way in which the laser speed detector functions and the characteristics of its component parts are such that I am satisfied that winter temperatures within the range expected in New Jersey would not affect the functioning of the detector."
"If temperature did affect the functioning of the detector, the result would be a failure to get a reading, not an erroneous reading."
There was no testing of the laser speed detector under conditions of heavy rainfall or under conditions when snow was falling.
My expectation is that heavy rain might interfere with the transmission of laser pulses and might make it impossible to obtain speed measurements.
I suspect it is even more likely that falling snow would block the obtaining of measurements by a laser speed detector.
"However, the absence of testing in conditions of heavy rain or of snow is not of practical significance."
"Heavy rain and snowfall do cause safety problems on our highways, but those problems do not arise because motorists operating under those conditions travel at speeds in excess of posted limits."
The reality is that heavy rain and snowfall would typically cause motorists to travel at speeds well below posted limits and law enforcement officers would not have any occasion to deploy a laser speed detector in conditions of heavy rain or of snow.
"ERROR TRAPPING
In the earlier Opinion with respect to the laser speed detector which I issued on June 13, 1996, I discussed some of the erroneous data which could theoretically be produced if laser pulses were allowed to sweep along a vehicle, or were panned from one vehicle to another or were to splash from one vehicle to another."
"The designer of the laser speed detector is aware of those possibilities for error, and has designed computer programs and hardware mechanisms calculated to trap a variety of errors."
"When the laser speed detector receives data which do not permit an accurate calculation of speed, it is designed to give an error message."
An error message is not an erroneous reading.
It is a positive statement by the detector that it cannot make a speed measurement because it is receiving insufficient data or inconsistent data.
"In preparation for the current hearings, the State conducted a number of field tests designed to determine whether the error trapping programs and mechanisms were functioning appropriately."
"On September 26, 1996, the State Police deployed the detector against 25 different vehicles which happened to be traveling along Interstate 80 in Knowlton Township."
The police officer operating the detector targeted a vehicle traveling abreast of another vehicle and then panned the detector from the target vehicle to the adjacent vehicle.
"Panning was accomplished in some instances by vertical movement of the target designator dot off the target vehicle, in some instances by horizontal movement of the dot off the target vehicle and in still other instances by circular movement of the target dot."
This kind of operation should have produced error messages.
"In each of *388 the 25 cases in which there was deliberate panning from one vehicle to another, the laser speed detector gave an error message indicating that it could not make a speed calculation because of insufficient or inconsistent data."
"On June 30 and July 1, 1997, additional tests of the laser speed detector's error trapping abilities were carried out by the State Police and the Department of Transportation on Interstate 80 in Mount Olive Township."
"In the first test, the operator targeted one of two vehicles moving abreast of another vehicle and moved the target dot horizontally from one vehicle onto the other while keeping the trigger depressed."
Fifty vehicle pairs were targeted in this manner.
This kind of use should have produced error messages.
"In each instance, an error message was produced."
The 50 vehicle pairs used for this test were a variety of motor vehicles which happened to be traveling along the highway while the procedures were being performed.
"In a further test, two State Police cars were driven at controlled speeds in adjacent lanes."
"The target vehicle in the left lane was instructed to maintain a speed of 55 miles per hour, while the target vehicle in the center lane was instructed to maintain a speed of 53 miles per hour."
The target dot was then panned horizontally from the faster vehicle in the left lane to the slower vehicle in the center lane.
"Eight total passes were made at ranges varying from 1,000 feet to 400 feet with several readings being taken on each pass."
This kind of use should have produced error messages.
A total of 57 readings were obtained.
Each of the 57 readings was an error message.
"In a further test, two State Police vehicles were driven in adjacent lanes, with the left lane vehicle being instructed to maintain a speed of 55 miles per hour, while the central lane vehicle was instructed to maintain a speed of 53 miles per hour."
"In this test, the operator of the detector was instructed not to target either vehicle, but instead to target a spot between the two vehicles."
"Eight total passes were made, and 53 readings were obtained."
This kind of use should have produced error messages.
Each of the 53 readings was an error message.
The next procedure was designed to determine the ability to detect a different kind of error possibility.
"Theoretically, an accurate speed reading might be determined from a variety of points on a vehicle."
"However, the best point on a vehicle for obtaining a speed reading is the license plate, and police officers are instructed to target the license plate when attempting to get a reading for law enforcement purposes."
"An accurate speed measurement might be obtained on occasion by targeting the windshield of a vehicle, but the configuration and texture of windshields are such that poor and misleading reflections would normally be returned from the windshield area."
"In this test, the detector operator was instructed first to fire a distinct laser shot at the license plate and then to fire a second distinct shot at the windshield of the vehicle."
Fifty target vehicles were randomly selected from vehicles traveling along the highway.
"A speed reading was received for each of the 50 vehicles with respect to the laser shot fired at the license plate, but the results were markedly different for the shots fired at the windshields."
"In 44 cases, the shot fired at the windshield produced an error reading, which would be the usual expectation."
"In six cases, the shot fired at the windshield produced a speed measurement."
"In five of those six cases, the windshield speed reading was exactly the same as the license plate speed reading for the same vehicle."
"In one of the six cases, the windshield target speed was one mile per hour higher than the license plate target speed."
This test was repeated with a slight variation on 50 additional randomly selected vehicles.
"The variation for the second set of 50 vehicles was that the grill area of the vehicle would be targeted first, with a second shot being taken at the windshield of the vehicle."
The grill area of the vehicle is thought to be almost as good a spot for getting an accurate reading as is the license plate.
"In this variation of the test, a speed reading was obtained from each of the 50 vehicles when the grill area was targeted."
"With respect to the shots fired at the windshield area, 48 error messages were received."
"Two speed measurements *389 were obtained from the windshield area, and each of them was identical with the speed measurement obtained from the license plate area of the same vehicle."
"A further test of error trapping involved 50 vehicles, most of which were trucks, with several being vehicles such as a bus or a motor home."
"In each case, the laser speed detector operator was instructed to pan the detector's red target dot along the side of the vehicle while keeping the trigger depressed."
This kind of operation should have produced error messages.
"For all 50 vehicles, the laser speed detector produced an error message."
"In the next error trapping test, 49 trucks and one motor home were randomly selected from the traffic flow, and the laser speed detector operator was instructed to pan on the side of the vehicle in both a horizontal and a vertical direction."
"For each of the 50 vehicles, an error message was obtained."
A further test involved two State Police vehicles traveling in tandem in the left lane.
"The lead car was instructed to maintain a steady speed of 55 miles per hour, while the trail car was instructed to maintain a following distance of three car lengths behind the lead car."
The laser speed detector operator was instructed to target the lead car and then move the red target dot between the lead and the trail cars while keeping the trigger depressed.
"The vehicles were targeted starting at 1,000 feet and as many readings as possible continued until the lead car reached the 400 foot range."
This kind of operation should have produced error messages.
A total of six passes were made and 50 distinct readings were produced by the detector.
Each reading was an error message.
"VEHICLE DISCRIMINATION
In another test, trucks were randomly selected from the traffic flow."
A State Police vehicle was then instructed to drive alongside the truck and to achieve a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour as it passed the truck.
The laser speed detector operator was instructed to target the police vehicle first while it was alongside the truck and then to take as many distinct measurements as possible of the police vehicle until the police vehicle was within 400 feet of the operator.
"At that point, a final speed measurement was to be taken by a separate shot fired at the truck."
"The purpose of this test was to determine whether reliable speed measurements could be obtained on vehicles in a passing situation and to determine whether any ""splashover"" of the laser beam occurs in this sort of passing situation."
A claimed advantage of the laser speed detector over radar is that it can discriminate between vehicles under these conditions and get an accurate speed measurement of each vehicle.
A total of 11 passes and 61 measurements were made.
"In each case, an accurate speed measurement was obtained for each vehicle targeted and no ""splashover"" occurred."
The final test involved two State Police vehicles traveling in tandem.
"The lead car was instructed to maintain a steady speed of 55 miles per hour, while the following car was instructed to maintain a steady speed of 53 miles per hour."
The laser speed detector operator was instructed to target the lead car and to lock the target dot on the lead car.
He was then to take as many readings as possible of the lead car while the tandem pair approached the operator.
"The lead vehicle was targeted at 1,000 feet and as many readings as possible were continued until the lead car reached the 400 foot range."
"At that point, the operator was instructed to fire a separate distinct shot at the trail vehicle."
A claimed advantage of the laser speed detector over radar is that it can discriminate between vehicles under these conditions and get an accurate speed measurement of each vehicle.
Eight passes were made in this fashion and a total of 52 readings were made.
"In every instance, the detector obtained a valid speed measurement on both the lead and the trail vehicles."
......
The various tests conducted by the State Police which were designed to explore the error trapping capability of the laser speed detector indicated that the error trapping programs and mechanisms functioned precisely as the detector manufacturer claimed they would.
"Other tests indicated that when *390 operated carefully, the laser speed detector had the ability to discriminate between vehicles which the manufacturer claimed."
"However, the friends of the court presented a videotape of a procedure which produced a result which seemed to indicate that the error trapping mechanisms did not always work as they were supposed to."
"In the procedure presented on the videotape, the laser speed detector was targeted at a stationary vehicle and at the side of a house and was then moved with the trigger depressed in a variety of directions."
"In a number of instances, this procedure produced on the laser speed detector a speed measurement indicating that the stationary object or the stationary vehicle was moving at a slow rate of speed, such as five miles per hour or eleven miles per hour."
"The designer of the laser speed detector, Jeremy Dunne, countered this testimony by saying that the error trapping programs built into the detector were designed to cope with insufficient or inconsistent data which would be produced by an operator using the detector for its intended purpose."
"That is to say, they were designed in contemplation of being used against moving vehicles and of coping with error risks which might be produced when the laser beam was targeted on such vehicles or close to them."
"As I understood this testimony, presumably an error trapping program could be designed to prevent a speed reading of a stationary vehicle, but the manufacturer had not gone to the trouble and expense of designing such a program, because, in real life, an operator using the detector for law enforcement purposes would have no reason to target a stationary vehicle and then to move the detector around while keeping the trigger depressed."
"In short, the detector was not designed to be deployed against a stationary vehicle or object (except for distant measurement purposes), and there simply was no need to design error trapping programs with respect to speed measurements from a stationary vehicle or object."
I accept this explanation.
"COMMENTS ON THE TESTING PROGRAM
Evidence with respect to performance testing of the laser speed detector was presented to me in a hearing which extended over a period of four days."
The evidence established that the basic testing observations were made and recorded by State Police officers and by employees of the Department of Transportation.
I am satisfied that the observers honestly and accurately made and recorded their observations.
"The basic data was then compiled and organized by Stephen R. Decker, a principal engineer employed by the New Jersey Department of Transportation."
"Except for some insignificant clerical errors, the compilation and reporting of the a sic data are fundamentally accurate."
The testing program designed and carried out by the Department of Transportation and the State Police was far from perfect.
"As the friends of the court pointed out, the testing could have been much more comprehensive with respect to the number of vehicles and with respect to variations in climate conditions."
Better procedures for cross-checking and verification of data collection could have been employed.
There were anomalies which were not explored as fully as they might have been.
"For example, although the vast bulk of speed measurements fell within the acceptable range of -2 miles per hour to +1 mile per hour, there were a number of readings which were markedly outside that range and there was no explanation proffered with respect to that."
"There was one laser speed detector reading which was as much as seven miles per hour below the reading produced by the device against which it was being compared, and there was another laser speed detector reading which was as much as five miles per hour higher than the reading produced on the device against which the detector was being compared."
"Even though those anomalous readings were very limited in number, I would have preferred to have received some plausible explanation for them other than being asked to conclude that they are harmless anomalies."
"I note that 150 measurements taken in conditions of moderate rainfall produced nine laser speed detector readings which were more than one mile per hour higher than the readings produced by the comparison device, *391 while 1,758 measurements taken in fair weather produced only seven readings which were more than one mile per hour in excess of the reading produced by the comparison device."
"It is possible that the rainfall may have been affecting the comparison device more than the laser speed detector, but that was not explored."
"It is also true that the highest reading produced by the laser speed detector in rainfall conditions was only three miles per hour in excess of the reading produced by the comparison device, and three miles per hour is not, in my judgment, a disqualifying number in terms of the practical law enforcement situation in which the detector will be used."
But there is a somewhat troubling divergence from the viewpoint of scientific inquiry.
"CONCLUSION
I end up being impressed by the fact that when we combine the results for the comparisons with both the WIM system and radar, we have only 16 cases out of 1,908 in which the speed measurement produced by the laser speed detector exceeded the measurement produced by the comparison device by more than one mile per hour."
That amounts to 0.8%.
I also note that the speed measurement produced by the laser speed detector only once exceeded by more than one mile per hour the measurement produced by the track timer and never exceeded by more than one mile per hour the measurement produced by the PEEK 241 or the fifth wheel.
"I am satisfied from the evidence presented in the proceedings which led to the issuance of my Opinion of June 13, 1996 and from the evidence presented during the recent hearings before me that the general concept of using lasers to calculate the speed of motor vehicles is generally accepted within the relevant scientific community and is valid."
"Despite the fact that the testing conducted was far from perfect, it was adequate, and I am satisfied from the totality of the evidence presented to me that the laser speed detector produces reasonably uniform and reasonably reliable measurements of the speed of motor vehicles under conditions likely to be present on New Jersey highways when the detector is used for law enforcement purposes."
The error trapping programs and mechanisms built into the detector are fully adequate to prevent unreliable speed measurements when used for law enforcement purposes.

"Students Help Southerners Keep Land in the Family

Jared Strumwasser, Becky Jaffe, Jonathan Korin

August 14, 2009

Last spring, Becky Jaffe ’09 and Jared Strumwasser ’10, students in the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program (HNMCP) spent a week in North Carolina working on a unique project to help extended families resolve conflicts in order to keep valuable land in their own hands."
"In the Deep South, there are hundreds of large tracts of land that have passed down through generations of African American families without benefit of a formal will."
"Jointly owned by many family members, the land can be the source of serious family conflict, making it nearly impossible to achieve consensus on such things as making improvements or divvying up the tax bill."
"While the value of the land can be significant, the unwieldy ownership structure can render it essentially worthless for the families."
"Over the past century, many families have ended up losing the land to forced sales by a court or been unable to do anything constructive with it."
"“There’s reduced incentive to improve the land,” explains Jaffe."
"“If you're one of 15 owners, why put in 100 hours improving it if you only own a small percent?” Title to the land is often unclear, so there are other problems, including difficulty in qualifying for loans to make improvements."
"And if one person insists on selling his or her interest, a court may order the entire property sold since it can be impossible to divide it into parcels of equal worth."
"There are legal mechanisms that can help families have more control over their land, but getting everyone to participate can be very difficult."
The Clinic’s role is to work with individual families to help them figure out what they want to do with their land and how to resolve disputes over it.
"HNMCP became involved in the “heirs project” at the invitation of the Heirs' Property Retention Coalition in North Carolina, comprised of various groups assisting these families."
"In March, under the direction of Matt Smith ’05, a Lecturer on Law and Clinical Fellow at HNMCP, Jaffe and Strumwasser traveled to North Carolina to work with a multi-generational family trying to decide the best use of 150 acres of farmland and woodland in eastern North Carolina."
"Jonathan Korin ’10, also an integral part of the team, couldn't join them on site but worked with Jared and Becky upon their return to create a manual to help lawyers create a consensus-building process for other families in conflict."
"In the weeks before they flew to North Carolina, the students did phone interviews with all the members of the family to figure out what disputes existed and how open the family was to help resolving them."
"When the students finally met the family, which gathered at a local motel conference room, they were happy to find how receptive they were to the project."
"“One of them said, ‘This is an historic moment for our family,’ and had brought a camera to the meeting,” recalls Jaffe."
"She and Strumwasser set a positive tone for negotiations by asking everyone to discuss their favorite foods, moving from there to more difficult topics."
"The family was exceptionally gracious to the students, taking them on a tour of the property and offering to have them return as guests."
"“Helping a family maintain their ancestral land was very rewarding,” says Strumwasser, who this summer worked at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in San Francisco."
“At times it got very emotional.
"We uncovered some family issues that are bound to exist in any family, and there were definitely moments when I feared we might have actually made this situation worse."
"But ultimately, we resolved all the tensions and there was nothing but smiles and backslaps, and promises that if I come back to North Carolina, they'd cook me barbecue.”

The “heirs project” is one of a number of cutting-edge negotiation projects at the Clinic, including a project assisting environmental lawyers in China and one helping residents of Nigeria negotiate the best use of corporate donations from major companies."
"HNMCP was founded in 2006 by Robert Bordone, Director of the Clinic and the Thaddeus R. Beal Clinical Professor of Law."
It is the first legal clinic in the U.S. focusing on dispute systems design and conflict management.
"Approximately thirty students each year, while enrolled in a related academic course on dispute resolution, work on a wide variety of projects for real-world clients, including in international settings."
"“The student team did a terrific job translating some of the conflict-mapping and mediation tools we teach in the classroom to an entirely different and challenging context, one that provides a novel set of process options to address very important challenges facing African-American families in the South,” says Bordone."
Two addresses in east London are being searched by police in connection with Saturday's deadly terror attack in the capital.
The Metropolitan Police said officers entered properties in Newham and Barking at 4.15am on Monday and “a number” of people have been detained.
"Searches were continuing at both addresses, police added."
Residents reported hearing “loud flash bangs and gunshots” in the early hours of Monday morning.
Twitter user BatemanLDN said: “It woke me up along with the whole street.
Extremely loud bangs followed by gunshot bangs.
“All ok - very shaken residents nearby though.
"All quietened down now.”

Simon Tucker wrote: “Heard this in the Dagenham area at around 4:15 am."
Started with loud explosion sound.
"Followed by about 20 shots, Some sounded distant.”

Terrorists brought carnage to the streets of Britain for the second time in as many weeks, killing seven and leaving 21 fighting for their lives."
Pedestrians were mowed down by a van on London Bridge before attackers stabbed a police officer and revellers around Borough Market with 12-inch knives.
One of the attackers shouted “this is for Allah” as he knifed a man near a pub - while Isis claimed its fighters carried out the attack.
"The three men, wearing fake suicide bomb vests, were shot dead by eight officers outside a pub after police opened fire with an “unprecedented” hail of 50 bullets, while a bystander was also shot."
Officers say they know the identities of the men who carried out the attack and will release the names “as soon as operationally possible”.
Scotland Yard said seven women and five men aged between 19 and 60 were arrested under the Terrorism Act in Barking on Sunday.
A 55-year-old man was later released without charge.
"A vigil will be held on Monday evening near London Bridge in honour of the victims of the attack, which took place at around 10pm, while a minute's silence will take place at 11am on Tuesday."
"The first victim of the attack has been named as Canadian national Christine Archibald, who worked in a homeless shelter until she moved to Europe to be with her fiance."
"Her family said in a statement: “We grieve the loss of our beautiful, loving daughter and sister."
She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected.
"“She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death.”

Network Rail said London Bridge rail and London Underground stations reopened at 5am but the rail station will be exit only."
"People from around the world were caught up as hundreds cowered in pubs and restaurants, barricading themselves inside as the attackers stalked the streets."
"Tales of heroism emerged in the aftermath, with one British Transport Police officer taking on the trio armed only with his baton before being stabbed in the head, face and leg."
An off-duty Metropolitan Police officer was also injured after he tackled the men.
"Forty-eight people were left in hospital, 21 critically injured."
"As counter-terrorism police units and security services launched a huge investigation for the third time in a matter of weeks, officers arrested a dozen people in raids on flats in Barking, east London, where residents said they believed one of the terrorists may have lived."
One neighbour said one of the attackers had recently asked him how he could hire a van.
"A friend of one of the attackers also told the BBC Asian Network he had reported him to the anti-terror hotline after he began expressing increasingly radical views and justifying terror attacks, but the man said he was never arrested."
Two suspects were also detained in East Ham.
Witnesses to Saturday's attack said the terrorists deliberately drove into pedestrians on London Bridge shortly after 10pm - in the same way as Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood.
"Attacking people after abandoning the van, they headed to Borough Market where the pubs and restaurants were packed with Saturday night crowds, many watching the Champions League final between Juventus and Real Madrid in Cardiff."
"One woman, Elizabeth O'Neill, said her son Daniel was approached by one of the men who said, 'this is for my family, this is for Islam', before sticking a knife in him."
The 23-year-old was left with a seven-inch wound from his stomach to his back and was saved by a friend who applied a tourniquet and took him downstairs in a pub.
"With her son being treated in King's College Hospital, Mrs O'Neill condemned the terrorists as “callous and barbaric”, saying: “These people say they are doing it in the name of God, which is an absolute joke.”

Giving an update on the investigation outside New Scotland Yard, the Met's assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said “significant progress” had been made in identifying the attackers."
"He said that as well as more armed police across the capital in coming days, “the public will also see increased physical measures in order to keep public safe on London's bridges”."
"The Government's emergency Cobra committee gathered on Sunday afternoon, for the second time that day, to discuss the attack."
"Prime Minister Theresa May delivered a stark assessment of the threat facing the UK, saying that although there was no direct link between the three incidents, “terrorism breeds terrorism”."
"She warned Britain is in the grip of a spate of copycat terror plots and stated her determination to stamp out “safe spaces” that exist in the real world, saying: “There is - to be frank - far too much tolerance of extremism in our country.”

Mrs May set out a four-pronged strategy to tackle terror by countering radical ideology; clamping down on online extremism; preventing the growth of segregated communities; and giving extra powers to police, security agencies and courts."
"But Labour complained she was getting involved in political debate on a day when the parties had agreed to halt election campaigning until the evening - before leader Jeremy Corbyn denounced her record on dealing with the terror threat, accusing her of denying resources to the police and security services."
"After Mrs May delivered her bleak appraisal of the risk facing the UK, US president Donald Trump, in a series of early morning tweets, lashed out at London mayor Sadiq Khan for his response to the attack, saying it is time to “stop being politically correct” about terrorism."
"However, the President's criticism of Mr Khan for suggesting Londoners should not be “alarmed” was based on a clear misinterpretation of some of the mayor's comments."
"In a withering riposte, a spokesman for the mayor said: “He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet.”

"Congress votes on major issues in the week ending June 21

Published: Friday, June 21, 2013 at 2:03 p.m.

Last Modified: Friday, June 21, 2013 at 2:03 p.m.

By Voterama in Congress

WASHINGTON — Here’s how North Carolina members of Congress voted on major issues in the week ending June 21."
"House

STRICTER ABORTION LIMITS: Voting 228 for and 196 against, the House on June 18 sent the Senate a bill (HR 1797) to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of fertilization on grounds that the fetus can feel pain by then."
"This conflicts with the medical standard in the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which held that abortion is legal up to when the fetus reaches viability -- usually after 24-to-28 weeks of pregnancy -- and after viability if it is necessary to protect the health or life of the mother."
"Under Roe, viability occurs when the fetus can potentially survive outside the womb with or without artificial aid."
This bill allows exceptions only for victims of rape or incest who report the crime to authorities within 48 hours of its occurrence.
The bill subjects doctors found guilty to up to five years in prison but imposes no criminal penalty on their patients.
"DEFEAT OF FARM BILL: Voting 195 for and 234 against, the House on June 20 defeated a bill (HR 1947) to renew federal agriculture and nutrition programs for five years at a projected cost of nearly $1 trillion over ten years, down $40 billion from current spending levels."
"About $744 billion of the outlay is for food stamps and other food and nutrition programs, with the remainder allocated to protecting farm income, subsidizing crop insurance, boosting exports, expanding domestic markets, promoting land conservation and funding rural development."
The bill would cut food stamps — officially named the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — by $20.5 billion over ten years and impose work requirements and drug testing on recipients.
The bill was opposed by 88 percent of Democrats who voted and 27 percent of Republicans who voted.
The bill ends the system of direct payments that has been sending $5 billion annually to farmers regardless of whether they grow crops.
The bill offers most commodity producers a choice between two programs for stabilizing incomes — one a cushion against price drops and the other a floor under revenue losses.
The two risk-management programs are projected to cost $23 billion over ten years.
The bill replaces dairy price supports with a Dairy Market Stabilization Program aimed at managing supplies; renews without change a federal sugar program that costs taxpayers nothing but adds to food and beverage costs; subsidizes growers’ export programs; renews overseas food-donation programs such as Food for Peace and renews the protectionist program for peanut growers essentially as is.
"DISPUTE OVER FOOD STAMPS: Voting 188 for and 234 against, the House on June 19 refused to restore food-stamps cuts of $20.5 billion over ten years contained in HR 1947 (above)."
The cuts in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would result in an estimated 2 million persons each year losing stamps.
"Backers said the cuts would wring waste, fraud and abuse out of food stamps, while opponents said they would result in qualified recipients, including families with children, going hungry."
The cost of the amendment was to have been offset by cutting supports for commodity growers.
"COMMODITY-PAYMENT CAPS: Voting 230 for and 194 against, the House on June 20 placed a cap of $250,000 on total payments to any single farm under commodity programs in HR 1947 (above)."
"Consisting largely of income and price supports, these payments go primarily to growers of wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, rice and peanuts."
The amendment was supported family farms and seen as costly to agribusiness operations.
"U.S.-MEXICO BORDER FENCING: Voting 39 for and 54 against, the Senate on June 18 refused to require 350 miles of reinforced, double-layered fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border to be built before any undocumented person could apply for “Registered Provisional Immigrant” status under a pending immigration bill (S 744)."
The amendment required another 350 miles of double-layered fencing to be completed in the ten years it will take for applicants to progress from RPI status to eligibility to apply for green cards.
"The border stretches nearly 2,000 miles from Texas to California."
"Under a 1996 law, the Department of Homeland Security has built about 350 miles of pedestrian fencing along the border, only 40 miles of which is double-layered."
"The department has put in place another 350 miles of vehicle barriers plus impediments such as sensors, land-based cameras and aerial surveillance."
A yes vote backed the amendment.
"Voting yes: Republican Richard Burr

Voting no: Democrat Kay Hagan

IMMIGRATION SECURITY PLAN: Voting 61 for and 37 against, the Senate on June 19 tabled (killed) the strictest security plan yet considered during debate on S 744 (above)."
"Before any undocumented immigrant could start on the 13-year path to legal status, the government would have to establish surveillance of the entire Southwest border, build hundreds of miles of double-layered fencing there, end its policy of releasing those caught in illegal crossings and establish total exit tracking of foreign visitors on temporary visas, among other security steps."
Congressional votes would be required every five years to allow the legalization of immigrants to continue.
A yes vote opposed the amendment.
"Voting yes: Hagan

Voting no: Burr

A look ahead

In the week of June 24, the House will take up a bill to expand offshore drilling, while the Senate will debate immigration policy."
Both chambers may vote to avert a doubling of student-loan interest rates July 1.
Congress begins its Independence Day recess at week’s end.

"Prep football: First-year head coach aims to turn Ross around

First-year head coach Kenyon Commins has two main goals for his Ross High School football team: Raise the intensity and become a better reflection of the community it represents."
"After spending four years as an assistant for the Rams, Commins was promoted to replace Brian Butts, who resigned this offseason."
"Commins has the task of trying to turn around a team that finished 2-8 last year, ending on a seven-game losing streak, and a program that hasn’t had a winning season since 2013."
He has some good ideas how to do that.
"“Obviously being there the last four years has allowed me to get an inside track of what I think should be fixed and the changes I wanted to make from the staff all the way down to lifting and practice and those things,” Commins said."
“My focus is the overall intensity and enthusiasm about what’s going on.
“In the past it was almost treated like intramurals.
"We were unemotional, and that snowballs into a lot of other things."
Effort is a huge thing.
"I preach being a reflection of the community, and everyone out here is a blue-collar person."
"If you watch the football team that represents it, it doesn’t seem like hard-working kids."
"That’s the biggest thing I wanted to attack.”

Hiring high-energy assistants was the first step in that plan, Commins said, because the staff needs to reflect the qualities it is trying to bring out in the players."
"Only a handful of assistants from seventh grade on up to varsity remained on board after Butts left, so the program truly is rebuilding with a fresh start, and that began in the weight room this offseason."
Commins stressed the need for players to get bigger and stronger in order to become the workhorse type of team Ross would like to see.
"“I’m really anxious to get going, but I was probably just as anxious to get into the weight room, which is still probably the biggest area we need to improve in,” Commins said."
"“That is the first place we wanted to see that intensity and energy level raised.”

Personnel-wise on the field, Ross returns about six starters on defense and five on offense, but several others got playing time or were out of position and have been moved to new roles."
Commins believes the defense will be the Rams’ strong suit as the area with the most experience coming back.
"Among the top players returning on that side of the ball are senior linebackers Joe Valentine, Austin Hamblin and Andrew Records, senior defensive lineman Logan Lange, and defensive backs Jordan Hodge, Eathan Minges and Sean Lange."
Valentine was a second-team All-Southwest Ohio Conference player last year and Hodge tied the school record for most interceptions in a season with five as a sophomore in 2016.
"“I always want to be a defensive-oriented program,” Commins said."
"“We will lean on them early in the season, especially schematically, because the offense is usually slower to come around."
"It will take a little while before we hit our stride offensively, so they might have to carry the load for a few weeks.”

Ross lost three of its top four statistical leaders on offense with quarterback Zach Arno, running back Brennan Morton and wide receiver Blake Niefield graduating."
"Junior Dylan Zimmerman, who led the team with 336 receiving yards last year, is expected to slide in at quarterback with Minges backing him up, but the Rams are being cautious with Zimmerman this preseason after he tweaked a groin."
"Commins said both quarterbacks can “zing it around the yard a little,” but Ross will remain a run-oriented team looking to control the clock."
"The backfield will take on a running back by committee look with guys like senior Jacob Brewer, sophomore Mehki Bouldin and junior Shay Mather sharing carries."
"They will work behind a fairly experienced offensive line that returns junior Taylor Polly and seniors TJ Vicars and Tommy Woodruff, who blew out his ACL in the first game last year and missed the entire season."
Sophomore Keith Collier and junior Garrett Boyle also are in the mix to start up front.
"“The biggest thing is we’ve got new sets of eyes on these guys, so a lot of players are getting looks that weren’t before, and they are fitting in,” Commins said."
“The players have responded well.
"We still have a long way to go, but we’ve made huge strides.”

Ross opens the season Aug. 25 at Badin and is on the road for its first SWOC game Sept. 15 at Harrison."
The Rams went 0-6 in conference play a year ago.
[Dimensional modeling analysis for outpatient payments].
"This paper introduces a data warehouse model for outpatient payments, which is designed according to the requirements of the hospital financial management while dimensional modeling technique is combined with the analysis on the requirements."
"This data warehouse model can not only improve the accuracy of financial management requirements, but also greatly increase the efficiency and quality of the hospital management."
There is a river running through the town and it's close to the sea.
We rented kayaks and spent a day exploring the coastline and small islands.
"The Swedish Allemansrätten, or right to access nature, makes it possible to go ashore pretty much everywhere.Anders"
"Browse by date

The scat collection study is continuing after the first batch of scats (172) have been independently analysed."
"The Conservation Volunteers, Nature Wise program commenced their second program on Fraser Island on May 15."
"The program had four participants, with Jono Bateman as the program leader."
"NRM QPWS rangers John, Gordon and Linda assisted the group in the collection of the scats and provided vital information on Fraser Island dingoes and the scat study."
"Preliminary results of the first batch of scats analysed

Over 30 scats were collected over the three mornings of collecting."
"Including the scats collected by the CVA, another 60 scats have recently been sent away for analysis."
It didn’t matter what Almirola said after the fact (he doesn’t blame Dillon at all for the wreck.)
The fact it was for the sport’s biggest race proved irrelevant.
"Instead, what I’ve heard this week has ranged from “cheap shot” to “the kid should be ashamed of himself.”

Let’s take a look at the move one last time before we continue."
Shall we?
"The way I see it, Almirola was blocking like crazy down the backstretch."
"Dillon then simply ran into the back of him rather than let Almirola back in line, killing his speed."
"(And with that, a chance to win the Daytona 500)."
But let’s take a look at a similar move made by a former driver of the No.
3 car.
Remember this one?
"Bristol, 1999, Earnhardt winning while “just trying to rattle his cage?” Terry Labonte was furious that night and the fans greeted the win with a chorus of boos."
"Labonte had the faster car, was about to pull away with fresh tires but Earnhardt wouldn’t let him have it."
But you know how that story ended?
Both men showed up to race the next week and the crowd was sold out.
The sport still signed a mega-TV deal for 2001 and kept growing.
People may have been angry… but they got over it.
"The move was a water-cooler topic for weeks and chalked up to the Intimidator just “doing his thing.”

Why doesn’t Dillon, whose move wasn’t nearly as blatant get the benefit of the doubt?"
Why are people crying foul over hard racing for the sport’s biggest prize?
"As our Danny Peters pointed out, personality has a lot to do with it."
"While Childress claimed after the race “we had 97 percent, I would say, or 98 percent support from the Earnhardt fans that said, we’re glad to see [the No."
3] back” I’d dispute that number.
There’s definitely a faction of fans who felt his grandson hadn’t earned the right to be in the No.
3 car.
"You’re hearing those fans scream out loud in the days after his Daytona 500 win, and Dillon hasn’t been the type of driver who dominates a race the way Earnhardt did."
"He’s led a total of just 79 laps in his career, half his number of NASCAR Cup starts (158)."
"Only three of those laps led came in his two wins, Sunday at Daytona and in last May’s Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte."
I think that’s why Dillon is struggling to earn more respect.
"You may only need to lead the last lap but he’s replacing a guy in Earnhardt who led 25,684 of them."
"If you don’t run up front consistently, even if you know how to close (and Dillon does) fans may perceive you differently."
"And in this race, Lady Luck played a role for Dillon."
He lost the draft on a bad pit stop and was half-a-lap behind until William Byron spun with 10 laps left.
"Without that, we’re talking Ryan Blaney, 2018 Daytona 500 winner or potentially Denny Hamlin or Darrell Wallace Jr."
But you know what?
Fans need to get over it.
Lady Luck has played a hand in racing since the second two cars strapped in against each other.
Dillon still had to put himself in position to win and then made an aggressive move Earnhardt would have approved of.
"“I had such a run, and I had to use it, and if I lift right there, I get run over out the back, too,” Dillon said."
“It’s part of this place.
"I’ve been run over‑‑ I’ve been in the catchfence and not mad after a race because it’s just part of it, man."
"Your eyes roll back in your head and you say don’t lift, and you just go.”

Isn’t that the type of aggressive mentality fans saw in Earnhardt?"
"But Dillon doesn’t get the benefit of the doubt cause his daddy was rich, his granddad is the car owner and he’s a 27-year-old new-age millennial with a video podcast?"
Not a gruff old southern boy with a hunting rifle in his hand?
I don’t get it.
"If even Almirola is letting Dillon off the hook, fans need to get over this one, too."
The national rating of 5.3 makes this Daytona 500 the lowest-rated ever.
But a closer look reveals it’s not as bad as it seems.
Viewership of 9.3 million is flat with the last time the race competed against the Winter Olympics (2014).
The difference in the final Nielsen rating is only five percent.
And are we really surprised to see a decline the first race after Dale Earnhardt Jr. retired?
"The year after Michael Jordan left the Bulls for the last time, in 1998, NBA Finals ratings decreased from 18.7 to 11.3."
"In golf, no Tiger Woods last season meant the lowest Masters rating in 13 years."
The bottom line is this year is the one where NASCAR declines should be expected.
With a whole new crop of young stars it’s going to take time for allegiances to grow.
"I, along with several garage and media members, was struck by how few fans were wearing favorite driver merchandise at Daytona."
Keep in mind everyone was still excited to be there; the vibe was great.
They were all just seemingly in the market to find their new wheelman.
A strong contingent of young talent up front gave them plenty of options to choose from Sunday.
"If Blaney can dominate races like that, best friend Wallace trailing right behind they’ll be crossover national stars."
Chase Elliott could win Atlanta this weekend and hit a new gear in popularity.
Bottom line?
Holding flat in viewership from the last Winter Olympics isn’t that bad when you consider Earnhardt was the one who won that Daytona 500.
There’s plenty of other metrics to measure the sport and all of them are trending positive.
Which reminds me….
Did You Notice?
… The impact Hamlin’s Barstool Sports Pardon My Take podcast interview had on NASCAR?
I was in New York City after the race and I’ve never heard more people mention the sport.
People thought Hamlin was hilarious as he connected with a whole new cross-section of 18-to-34 males.
Wallace even used the 70 percent Adderall line against him once the two tangled after the race.
“He might need to take Adderall for that one” has turned into a Wallace-Hamlin rivalry still red hot three days after Daytona.
"When our Joseph Wolkin asked Hamlin about his last-lap wreck with Wallace, the driver claimed he blew a tire."
There was nothing he could have done to avoid the contact.
"But now, it seems like Hamlin has blown his top over Wallace’s comments and there’s a second driver (add Elliott) blocked from his friends list entering the 2018 season."
Rivalries.
Raw emotion.
Drivers not just handing each other spots.
"If this attitude foreshadows what 2018 is like, we’re going to see a whole lot of new fans sign up."
Did You Notice?
"… Quick hits before taking off…

You can’t say enough about Wallace’s second-place finish."
The rookie had so much media attention leading up to the race.
There’s an inordinate amount of pressure as the first full-time African-American in Cup since 1971.
He’s driving in a sport that once openly supported segregationist candidate George Wallace.
And did I mention he had a total of four Cup Series starts before Sunday’s race?
"The outpouring of raw emotion, from mom’s hug to the tears on the podium was all too real."
"You couldn’t help but feel a changing of the guard, in that moment with Danica Patrick walking out the NASCAR door for the final time."
"It’s a different type of targeted audience (first woman vs. African-American) but for Wallace, the sky is the limit."
He can actually win.
There were so many people who did well at Daytona it’s important to recognize who didn’t.
Jimmie Johnson tore up three race cars.
"Chip Ganassi, who usually does well on plate tracks with Jamie McMurray never got the No."
1 car going.
"McMurray’s more famous teammate, Kyle Larson, started a last-lap wreck in the Clash and crashed in Sunday’s 500 miler."
These are names we could easily see inside the top 10 at Atlanta.
But they left the new Chevy Camaro ZL1 body with a more awkward start than expected.
66-year-old Mark Thompson missed the wrecks and ran 22nd in his first Daytona 500.
How about that?
Just goes to show you never give up on your dreams.
The man can always say he outran a seven-time champ and 18 drivers in the Great American Race.
"About Tom Bowles

The author of Bowles-Eye View (Mondays) and Did You Notice?"
(Wednesdays) Tom spends his time overseeing Frontstretch’s 30 staff members as its majority owner.
"Based in Philadelphia, Bowles is a two-time Emmy winner in NASCAR television and has worked in racing production with FOX, TNT, and ESPN while appearing on-air for SIRIUS XM Radio and FOX Sports 1's former show, the Crowd Goes Wild."
"Hey, writing about a sport isn’t a dangerous job and won’t put anyone reading it in danger either."
I say if Bowles wants to smoke pot then what’s the harm?
Now that we know he’s whacked out of head we might be able to enjoy the things he writes like we would a Cheech and Chong movie.
It’s better than my original diagnosis of being delusional.
The end of the 500 was no different than Petty-Pearson in 1976 and Donnie Allison-Cale Yarbourgh in 1979.
Two drivers going all out for the Harley J. Earl trophy.
On a superspeedway when the checkered flag is out it’s “no holds barred”.
"Sometimes the leader is punted, sometimes 2nd place gets blocked into the grass or wall, and sometimes they both crash."
That’s racing.
This year’s Speedweeks did have a different vibe.
I think the youth movement is beginning to shine.
This generation of drivers has a lot more personality and doesn’t seem restrained by Corporate America as much.
Maybe Dale Jr. and others hanging it up and letting a new generation shine is what NASCAR needs.
"New fans today don’t remember Dale Sr., Jeff Gordon, Bill Elliott or Tony Stewart, etc."
in their primes.
"However, maybe they can connect with these new, young, social media savvy drivers?"
Sometimes our fan base is too obsessed with past and sees it through rose colored glasses.
"I wish talent was all you needed to get a ride, Imagine how quick other sports would fail if you could pay to play without any real talent or if you could be the quarterback for an NFL team if your grandfather owned the team."
"NASCAR is declining because you need money or the ability to bring a sponsor to the table to get a ride and real fans know this, we are not seeing the best drivers in the field that came up through the ranks any more."
Eventually we will only see drivers who have bought their ride or been given a ride based on family connections.
Many years ago it didn’t used to be like that.
F1 has always been like that.
"Nascar did draw top talent in the early days, even well up into the 90’s and early 00’s."
But you’re right Nascar has gone the way of F1 and for me as a former racer and fan.
That’s why I haven’t watched Nascar nearly as much and don’t get excited to watch.
"Plus on top of that the rules are pretty ridiculous, the rules take away innovation, or ways for a small team to be competitive."
"You could in the past be competitive with just your wits, but now its not like that at all."
Its like their racing spec cars and that’s not fun to watch.
Btw on the article this guy who wrote this is nuts.
We’re talking about two totally different race tracks.
(like yin and yang).
Not even remotely close.
When looking at ratings you have to consider the snow storm effect.
Remember 1979?
Big snow storm got a much bigger audience & the fight started NASCAR growing.
"This year big snow overnight just before the 500 set up the same possibility, need to check audience & ratings in areas affected by the storm, might be more important than the Olympics in really understanding the health of the sport."
"Agree with poster saying Daytona is way different than Bristol, can’t compare a bump & run at a short track vs a dump on a super speedway."
"But even more important is blocking, allowing blocking is the end of real racing and the full WWFing of stock car racing."
There’s a big difference between a bump and run at Bristol than running over someone and putting someone nose first into the wall.
Drivers get killed on these Super-speedways.
How many have been killed at Bristol?
"I find I have a hard time warming up to Austin Dillon, and that didn’t change after Daytona."
"I’ve always thought his wearing the cowboy hat was silly, trying to be like The King, I assume, but his story about getting a ‘lucky penny’ before the race really got to me."
"I don’t know if he thinks he’s the next Big E or what, but things like that don’t endear him to me…and I know he doesn’t care."
"Neither do I.

Austin Dillon is not as good a driver as he thinks he is nor is he as bad as most fans think he is."
His average performance is around mid pack and he has led three laps to win two races.
"not a bad feat

The ratings have been declining long before this year, long before Dale Jr, Smoke, or Jeff Gordon retired."
"Frankly, the Dale Jr. effect may be overrated."
"Last year we should have seen dramatic ratings increases after the retirement announcement yet the ratings continued to decline, occasionally interrupted by a tepid increase."
Any regular poster here can give 15 or 20 or more reasons in their sleep.
"Yet the best we hear is the Olympics, mind you events being aired on tape delay."
"Last year the March races were allegedly impacted by March Madness, as if 2017 was the first year NASCAR races were run at the same time as the NCAA Basketball tournament."
"ARIC is too nice, that is just a fact."
Bless him.
"I don’t have to “get over” anything, my life has not changed for the better or worse since this annoying chicken hawk midget ahem…”won”."
There are just so many unlikeable things.
Himself and his Grandfather have exploited the #3 for all it is worth.
"Sad thing is this clown is just not worthy, and he has no identity of his own."
He comes off as and is an EARNHARDT SR. wannabe.
It is just embarrassing to watch.
"I dunno, something about him makes me wanna smack the shit out of him."

121 N.M. 166
William Z. HOGGARD d/b/a Phoenix Amusements, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
The CITY OF CARLSBAD through its Mayor, Robert FORREST, et al., Defendants-Appellants."
No.
15952.
Court of Appeals of New Mexico.
"October 20, 1995."
"Certiorari Denied January 10, 1996."
"*727 James W. Klipstine, Jr., Payne & Klipstine, P.A., Lovington, for Plaintiff-Appellee."
B.G.
"Davis, Rosenberg & Davis, Carlsbad and Steven L. Tucker, Tucker Law Firm, P.C., Santa Fe, for Defendants-Appellants."
"OPINION
BOSSON, Judge."
1.
"The City of Carlsbad appeals from an adverse jury verdict for breach of contract in the sum of $456,000."
Plaintiff sued the City for allegedly repudiating its contractual obligations to Plaintiff and thereby committing an anticipatory breach of that contract.
The primary question on appeal is whether the evidence introduced by Plaintiff to establish repudiation was sufficient to create an issue of fact for the jury.
We hold as a matter of law that a directed verdict should have been entered for the City on this issue.
"Therefore, we reverse on that claim and remand for a retrial and further consideration of other issues raised by both parties."
"FACTS
2."
"Plaintiff, an experienced carnival operator doing business under the name Phoenix Amusements, submitted a bid to the City to lease and operate a public amusement park along with certain concession rights."
"Plaintiff was the successful bidder, and on March 13, 1991, he entered into a formal Lease with the City for a fixed term of three years, requiring Plaintiff to pay annual rent in increasing amounts of $1000, $5000, and $10,000."
"The Lease provided that at the end of *728 the three-year term (March 1994), ""[Plaintiff] shall have the first right to continue leasing, subject to renegotiation and any changes in State or Federal laws governing the Lessor."""
"Plaintiff made his initial rent payment in 1991, but on July 27, 1992, Plaintiff requested the City to renegotiate the Lease."
"At the time, Plaintiff disclosed a deficit of nearly $20,000 and requested a reduction in the second annual payment."
"Instead of a reduction, the City agreed to a two-month extension for the second rental payment, from September 1, 1992 until October 31, 1992."
3.
"On October 27, 1992, the City entered into a contract entitled ""Agreement to Withhold Real Property for a Term of Years"" (the ""Pecos Agreement"") with a local non-profit corporation, the Pecos River Arts and Science Council, Inc. (the ""Pecos River Council""), for the purpose of attempting to develop a cultural center."
The land for the proposed center overlapped approximately 30-40% of the area under lease to Plaintiff.
"The Pecos Agreement provided the Pecos River Council with three years, until October 1995, to raise $500,000 toward the cultural center."
"During that time, the City promised to ""hold"" the land and not to ""dispose of nor alienate"" it."
"The City agreed to negotiate ""a suitable conveyance"" of the land to the Pecos River Council if sufficient funds were raised."
"If not, the Pecos Agreement would be void and have no further effect."
4.
Plaintiff interpreted the Pecos Agreement as a repudiation of his rights under the Lease.
"The day after the City entered into the Pecos Agreement, Plaintiff notified the City by letter that it had ""knowingly and willfully violated and breached the terms and conditions of the lease agreement,"" and that he intended to sue."
Plaintiff did not ask the City to clarify the effect of the Pecos Agreement on Plaintiff's rights under the Lease.
"Plaintiff failed to make the rental payment due October 31, 1992."
"A month later, the City gave Plaintiff written notice that he was in default and that he had thirty days to cure."
"When Plaintiff did not cure, the Lease was terminated, and Plaintiff left the park in February 1993."
5.
Plaintiff then filed this complaint alleging that the City had committed an anticipatory breach of the Lease by entering into the Pecos Agreement.
Plaintiff also alleged a loss of certain concession rights under the Lease and a failure by the City to bring certain park equipment into satisfactory condition according to the terms of the Lease.
"The City counterclaimed for unpaid rent, utility payments, and insurance premiums."
"After Plaintiff rested his case, the City moved for a directed verdict based on a lack of evidence that the City had repudiated its obligations under the Lease."
"The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the rights and obligations of the parties under both the Lease and the Pecos Agreement were ambiguous and that it was for the jury to decide whether the Lease had been breached."
"The jury returned a general verdict in favor of Plaintiff for $456,000 and against the City on its counterclaim."
The City appeals from the verdict.
"DISCUSSION

Repudiation of the Lease
6."
Plaintiff claims the City repudiated its obligations under the Lease when it entered into the Pecos Agreement.
"To carry his burden under New Mexico law, Plaintiff must meet the following standard: ""A repudiation which may be treated as a breach justifying nonperformance by the other party must be a distinct, unequivocal, and absolute refusal to perform according to the terms of the agreement."""
"Viramontes v. Fox, 65 N.M. 275, 282, 335 P.2d 1071, 1075 (1959); see 4 Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts § 973, at 905 (1951) [hereinafter Corbin] (requiring ""a definite and unequivocal manifestation of intention"" not to perform)."
Repudiation can be by act as well as by word.
"Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 250(b) (1981) [hereinafter Restatement] (defining repudiation by act as ""a voluntary affirmative act"" by a party that would make him ""unable or apparently unable to perform"" his commitments); Corbin, supra, § 973, at 913 (showing intent to repudiate may ""be made and communicated by conduct"")."
"Words or acts which are only ""doubtful and indefinite statements"" regarding performance, do not repudiate a contract."
"Corbin, supra, § 973, at 905."
*729 7.
Plaintiff does not claim a repudiation by word.
There is no evidence the City ever indicated that it would not perform under the Lease.
"Instead, Plaintiff maintains that the act of entering into the Pecos Agreement repudiated the Lease because it created conflicting and inconsistent obligations on the City's part with respect to the same land."
"Under the applicable standard, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the Pecos Agreement itself was so at odds with the Lease that the mere act of contracting rose to the level of a ""distinct, unequivocal, and absolute refusal [or inability] to perform."""
"Viramontes, 65 N.M. at 282, 335 P.2d at 1075."
We look first at the documents themselves for evidence of such a conflict.
8.
The Lease is clear in its essential terms.
Plaintiff had a lease for a fixed period: three years and no more.
"At the end of three years, Plaintiff had a right of first refusal: a ""first right to continue leasing, subject to renegotiation."""
"This gave Plaintiff a preferential position to renew the lease at the end of three years, but only if the City intended to continue leasing."
"See Spencer v. J.P. White Bldg., 92 N.M. 211, 214, 585 P.2d 1092, 1095 (1978) (holding that first right of refusal for re-lease is not an option to re-lease)."
Plaintiff's right of first refusal was conditional; it was dependent upon a future decision by the City to continue leasing.
Plaintiff did not have an option to extend the Lease at his discretion.
See id.
"; see also Gartley v. Ricketts, 107 N.M. 451, 453, 760 P.2d 143, 145 (1988) (same)."
"See generally Restatement, supra, § 261 (holding first right of refusal is only a conditional right to receive an option based on the occurrence of certain events); A.W."
"Gans, Annotation, Granting to Lessee of ""First"" Privilege or Right to Re-Lease or to Renewal or Extension of Tenancy Period as Conditioned upon Lessor's Willingness to Re-Lease, 6 A.L.R.2d 820 (1949); 8A George W. Thompson, Commentaries on the Modern Law of Real Property § 4441, at 246 (1963)."
The Lease is not ambiguous on this point.
9.
The Pecos Agreement is equally clear.
"It provided the Pecos River Council with a three-year opportunity to raise money for a cultural center which, if built, would include a portion of the land then leased to Plaintiff."
"During those three years, the City promised ""to hold and ."
.
.
not dispose of nor alienate the .
.
.
"land."""
"If at the end of three years, the Pecos River Council satisfied its fund-raising goal, then the City agreed to negotiate ""a suitable conveyance"" of the land."
"If not, there were no rights of renewal, and the Pecos Agreement would be null and void."
10.
We make two observations from the face of these documents.
"First, during the three-year term of the Lease, the City's obligations under both contracts are consistent and not in conflict."
"Under the Pecos Agreement, the City was obliged to ""hold"" the land and not to ""dispose of nor alienate"" it."
Nothing restricted the City from continuing to lease that land to Plaintiff; the Pecos Agreement did not interfere with the existing term of the Lease.
"Second, whatever expectations the Pecos River Council may have had with regard to the land at the end of the three-year ""hold"" period, they could only occur after Plaintiff's three-year Lease had run its course."
The Pecos Agreement could not be in conflict with the Lease unless Plaintiff had a unilateral right to renew the Lease.
"As we have said, the Lease does not give Plaintiff that right."
"Therefore, on its face, the Pecos Agreement did not violate Plaintiff's rights under the Lease."
"Entry into the Pecos Agreement was not a ""distinct, unequivocal, and absolute refusal to perform"" the City's obligations under the Lease."
"Viramontes, 65 N.M. at 282, 335 P.2d at 1075."
There was no repudiation as a matter of law.
11.
"Plaintiff contends that when these contracts are viewed through the lens of extrinsic evidence, they become ambiguous as a matter of law."
"With the benefit of such evidence, Plaintiff argues, reasonable minds can differ about Plaintiff's rights and the City's obligations under one or both contracts."
We acknowledge that the trial court had the discretion to hear evidence in an attempt to prove an ambiguity.
"Mark, Inc. v. Mellekas, 114 N.M. 778, 781, 845 P.2d 1232, 1235 (1993); C.R."
"Anthony Co. v. Loretto Mall Partners, 112 N.M. 504, 508-09, 817 P.2d 238, 242-43 (1991)."
"A party may show the circumstances surrounding the contract and attempt to clarify, but not contradict, *730 contractual language."
C.R.
"Anthony Co., 112 N.M. at 509, 817 P.2d at 243."
The trial court correctly heard evidence on whether there was an ambiguity.
"Thereafter, the trial court agreed with Plaintiff that the agreements were ambiguous and allowed the jury to decide whether the City had breached the Lease anticipatorily by executing the Pecos Agreement."
"[1]
12."
We do not agree with either Plaintiff or the trial court that extrinsic evidence made either of these contracts ambiguous.
We do not agree that the issue of repudiation or anticipatory breach should have gone to the jury.
We apply a de novo standard in reviewing the trial court's decision on this point.
"See Mark v, Inc., 114 N.M. at 782, 845 P.2d at 1236."
13.
"During his case in chief, Plaintiff presented evidence of his own understanding of the Lease."
"He testified that, in his opinion, the Lease actually afforded him more than three years to operate the amusement park."
"Plaintiff noted that the park had been a losing proposition for years, and both parties were aware that it would take some time to turn around."
Plaintiff presented expert testimony that a carnival of this type took more than three years to become a going concern.
Plaintiff had been successful elsewhere in the carnival business.
"Plaintiff allegedly would not have left the security of that business to take over a speculative venture without obtaining enough time, longer than three years, to make a success of it."
"There was evidence that Plaintiff was making a substantial investment of time, money, and energy."
There was also evidence that the City engaged the Carlsbad Development Council to conduct a long-term economic study of the park.
Plaintiff even used the incremental increase in rent over the term of the Lease as evidence that success would not be an overnight phenomenon.
"In short, Plaintiff did his best to demonstrate his understanding that he would have enough time in the Lease to turn the amusement park around and achieve success and that he would not be limited to an artificial term of years."
14.
"According to Plaintiff, his own expectations made the first right of refusal ambiguous."
"Plaintiff understood it to be more than just a conditional right, subject to the City's decision to continue leasing."
He thought he had an option.
"Plaintiff characterized the Lease as ""an option to continue leasing for an open-ended term."""
"Plaintiff argues that the City repudiated his supposed ""option"" the instant the City committed itself possibly to selling some of that same land to the Pecos River Council."
15.
We disagree with Plaintiff's basic premise.
"As a matter of law, one party's subjective impressions, innermost thoughts, or private intentions, do not create an ambiguity."
"Crawford Chevrolet, Inc. v. National Hole-in-One Ass'n, 113 N.M. 519, 522 n. 3, 828 P.2d 952, 955 n. 3 (1992); Perea v. Snyder, 117 N.M. 774, 780, 877 P.2d 580, 586 (Ct.App.)"
"(""[I]t is the intention which finds expression in the language used and not the party's secret or undisclosed intent that controls."
"""), cert."
"denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91 (1994)."
"Plaintiff cannot establish an ambiguity merely by attempting ""to raise a factual issue as to what was the intent in his own mind, which ."
.
.
"is not the issue."""
"Perea, 117 N.M. at 780, 877 P.2d at 586; see also Hansen v. Ford Motor Co., 120 N.M. 203, 206, 900 P.2d 952, 955 (1995) (stating that statements of unilateral, subjective intent are insufficient to establish ambiguity in light of clear contract language)."
Just because Plaintiff thought he had an option does not make it so.
Nor does it create an ambiguity for the jury to resolve.
16.
Plaintiff offered no evidence that the City had misrepresented the term of the contract or led him to believe he had longer than three years.
There is no evidence that the City ever agreed to Plaintiff's theory that he could renew the Lease unilaterally.
There was no evidence the City even knew of *731 Plaintiff's intent until long after the Lease was ended.
"[2]
17."
We also note the lack of evidence that the terms of the Lease were at all ambiguous when the parties actually contracted.
"The City's invitation for proposals stated that the term of the Lease could be ""approximately two years."""
There was no mention of any right of renewal or an option.
"Plaintiff's own bid was for ""three years,"" without any option or right of renewal."
Plaintiff drafted the Lease and presumably had every opportunity to make his intentions clear in the document.
Cf.
"Manuel Lujan Ins., Inc. v. Jordan, 100 N.M. 573, 576, 673 P.2d 1306, 1309 (1983) (holding to general rule that ambiguities in a contract are construed against the drafter); Restatement, supra, § 206 (same)."
"Finally, both the City and the Pecos River Council agreed that the Pecos Agreement was subject to whatever rights Plaintiff had in his Lease."
They did not intend the Pecos Agreement to repudiate the Lease.
"See Corbin, supra, § 984, at 951 n. 46 (no repudiation where second contract expressly subject to first contract)."
18.
Plaintiff may have thought he had additional rights under the Lease.
He could have demanded reasonable assurances from the City.
Cf.
"Restatement, supra, § 251 (reasonable doubt about intent to perform authorizes obligee to demand reasonable assurances from obligor of intent to perform)."
"But he did not do so, electing instead to declare a repudiation."
"Before making that leap, Plaintiff needed more than subjective impressions and personal expectations."
He needed an objectively reasonable basis to act.
As a matter of law Plaintiff did not establish an ambiguity that would make the issue of repudiation a jury question.
See Jaramillo v. Providence Washington Ins.
"Co., 117 N.M. 337, 342, 871 P.2d 1343, 1348 (1994) (""[U]nilateral, subjective intent ."
.
.
is not determinative.
The parties must adduce evidence of the objective intentions of the parties .
.
.
.
""")."
19.
"Therefore, even assuming all Plaintiff's allegations are true, we conclude that Plaintiff did not make a threshold showing that reasonable minds could differ in their understanding of the nature and term of Plaintiff's leasehold rights."
"Under well-established New Mexico law, Plaintiff did not have an option, and nothing he has presented could create a reasonable inference to the contrary."
The Pecos Agreement could not repudiate contractual rights which Plaintiff simply never had.
"Remaining Issues/Attorney Fees/Counterclaim
20."
"The jury instructions allowed Plaintiff to establish that the City breached the Lease by establishing at least one of the following contentions: (1) by depriving Hoggard of the use of all or part of the premises it had promised he could develop, (2) by depriving Hoggard of the concession rights it had promised him and (3) by failing to make the repairs and to keep the building in good repair as it had promised it would."
21.
The jury returned a general verdict based on all of Plaintiff's claims.
We do not know which of the three claims were successful.
We could speculate based on the sheer size of the award that the jury decided for Plaintiff solely on the claim for anticipatory breach and not on the much smaller claims for loss of concession rights and reimbursement for repairs.
"However, given the uncertainty of a general verdict, the proper course is to remand for a new trial on those issues."
"See Richardson v. Rutherford, 109 N.M. 495, 503 n. 5, 787 P.2d 414, 422 n. 5 (1990) (holding that ambiguity of general verdict based on more than one claim requires remand); Romero v. Mervyn's, 109 N.M. 249, 255, 784 P.2d 992, 998 (1989) (requiring reversal if a party submits jury instructions providing alternative bases for relief and if there is no substantial evidence to support any one alternative)."
"Of course, if Plaintiff's alleged loss of concession rights is based solely on his claim of repudiation and loss of *732 use after he moved out, the court must direct a verdict in the City's favor."
22.
"The City argues it was entitled to a directed verdict on its counterclaim for unpaid rent, insurance premiums, attorney fees, and similar obligations."
"The Lease entitled the City to attorney fees arising from Plaintiff's ""[f]ailure to perform any of the terms and conditions of this Lease."""
"The City claims that Plaintiff committed a ""failure to perform"" when he fell behind in rent and utility payments which, in turn, gave rise to the City's counterclaim and demand for attorney fees."
Plaintiff points out that the jury decided against the City on its counterclaim.
"Again, however, the ambiguity of the general verdict, which is interrelated with the counterclaim, may have affected the jury's consideration of the remaining issues, including the counterclaim."
"In fairness, given our reversal of Plaintiff's largest claim, the counterclaim should be remanded for retrial and with it the City's request for attorney fees."
"CONCLUSION
23."
The judgment is hereby reversed with instructions for the trial court to enter judgment for Defendant on Plaintiff's claim of anticipatory breach and repudiation.
"Plaintiff's remaining claims, as well as the City's counterclaim and request for attorney fees, are remanded for further consideration."
24.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
"WECHSLER and BUSTAMANTE, JJ., concur."
"NOTES
[1]  Plaintiff did not argue that he also had an implied contract or an oral contract, perhaps in light of NMSA 1978, Section 37-1-23 (Repl."
"Pamp.1990), under which any enforceable contract with a governmental entity must be in writing."
"We express no opinion as to whether the extrinsic evidence presented could create an implied contract if this were strictly a matter between private, non-governmental parties."
[2]  At oral argument counsel conceded Plaintiff never actually discussed with the City his thoughts about a term longer than three years and unilateral renewal rights.
"Counsel did allude to additional facts that would arguably amount to misrepresentation by the City, but they are not set forth in the briefs."
"SCRA 1986, 12-213(A)(3) (Repl.1992) (factual assertions must be supported in briefs by reference to the record)."
"Q:

How to change a given attribute a product is sold?"
"(When the order is completed)

I need to change one attribute when a product is sold, when the order is completed, I guess I can hook something/somewhere but I've no idea where/what."
thank you.
"A:

If your question is asked ""the magento way"", when you say ""order is completed"", this means that its status is ""complete""."
"An order with ""complete"" status has been ordered on the frontend site, then invoiced and shipped from the admin."
"My answer is based on this terminology, thus giving you clues to change a product attribute once an order has been completed (again, in the magento way)."
"Coding the whole thing for you is not good help and is very long, so here is the path (in my opinion) :)

Create a module
(Google is your friend for that)
Attach an observer to this module and make it observe the event ""sales_order_save_after""
(Google is your friend for that)
In the observer file / method, retrieve the order and its status
        $order = $observer->getEvent()->getOrder();
        $orderStatus = $order->getStatus();

If order status is ""completed"", create a foreach that updates the attribute you want for all items

This will give the same attribute value to all products."
"In this example, all products for a completed order will be renamed to 'Sold Product'."
"if ($orderStatus == 'complete') {
                $items = $order->getAllItems();
                foreach ($items as $item) {
                    $productsToUpdate[] = $item->getProductId();
                }
                $theAttributeToUpdate = 'name';
                $theAttributeValue = 'Sold Product';
                Mage::getSingleton('catalog/product_action')->updateAttributes($productsToUpdate, array($theAttributeToUpdate => $theAttributeValue), 0);
            }

This should be enough to put you on the right track."
"Getty Poll: Clinton's lead over Trump triples in Wisconsin

Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump has tripled in Wisconsin since July, with the Democratic nominee now holding a double-digit advantage, according to a Marquette University Law School poll of likely voters released Wednesday."
"Clinton leads Trump by 15 percentage points, with 52 percent support to Trump’s 37 percent support."
"Seven percent said they would vote for neither candidate, while 3 percent said they were undecided."
Clinton led Trump by just 4 percentage points in July before both parties convened their nominating conventions last month.
"In a four-way contest including Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, Clinton leads with 47 percent, followed by Trump at 34 percent, Johnson at 9 percent and Stein at 3 percent with 4 percent undecided and 2 percent choosing neither candidate."
"Clinton’s unfavorability rating nearly equals her favorability, a relative plus for a candidate who, like Trump, has historically high negatives nationally."
"Her net favorability is -1 percent, (48 percent favorable, 49 percent unfavorable), while Trump’s is -37 percent (28 percent favorable, 65 percent unfavorable)."
"Clinton is also the candidate respondents said cares about people like them (50 percent, yes; 48 percent, no) — much more so than Trump (31 percent, yes; 66 percent, no) — and has the qualifications to be president (61 percent, yes; 38 percent, no)."
"While voters largely share the same views on whether Clinton and Trump are honest, nearly 7-in-10 said Trump is unqualified for the White House."
"In the Senate race, former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold has expanded his f5-point lead over Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson from July."
Feingold now leads with 53 percent support to Johnson’s 42 percent support.
The Marquette University Law School survey of 683 likely voters was conducted via landline and cellphone and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
"Q:

If a function of matrices into the reals distributes over products then it sends any matrix with a row of zeros to zero."
Suppose $D:\mathbb{R}_{2\times 2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function from the space of 2x2 matrices into the reals.
"Suppose also that it satisfies $D(AB)=D(A)D(B)$ for all matrices $A,B\in \mathbb{R}_{2\times 2}$."
"Call  
$$J = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$$ 
and suppose $D(I)\ne D(J)$."
"I have already shown that such a function must map $D(I)=1$ and $D(J)=-1$, and $D(0)=0$."
"I've also shown that if $A^2=0$ then $D(A)=0$, and that if $A,B$ differ by a row-swap then $D(A)=-D(B)$."
"However, I can't see my way through showing that if any matrix $A$ has a zero-row, then $D(A)=0$."
"I have considered squaring $A$, writing it as a product of two other matrices, multiplying it by other matrices, and using the fact that matrices don't commute but real products do."
Nothing has worked and I'm out of ideas.
"A:

If $A$ has the first row $0$ iff $A = P \cdot A$, where $P=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$."
Now it enough to show that $P$ maps to $0$.
Consider also $Q= \begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}$.
"We have $Q=JPJ^{-1}$, so $P$, $Q$ map to the same value."
"Moreover, we have $PQ=0$, the zero matrix, and so $PQ$ maps to $0$."
We conclude $P$ maps to $0$.

Saturday, June 5, 2010

For the last year, I and others in the blogosphere have been encouraging people to NOT line up and take the so called Swine Flu ""vaccines"", due to the fact that the vaccines themselves contained a wide variety of toxins and poisons that would only weaken the body's own immune system."
We have been saying that the whole purpose of the Swine Flu scare was for the Pharmaceutical Industry to get rich off of the sales of their deadly potions.
"Also, people would be so weakened by the so called vaccines that when a more deadly form of virus was unleashed, many would die, and the Pharmaceutical criminals would get even richer from the need to develop and administer their newer vaccines to fight the newer pandemic."
Sweet deal for the Pharmaceuticals indeed!
Now it seems that we have been right all along.
There is a new report that just surfaced that claims that the drug firms actually encouraged the WHO to exaggerate the Swine Flu threat so as to get the people to line up and take their deadly poisons through the resultant fear generated!
"Here is an article from the Daily Mail online news service out of the UK at www.dailymail.co.uk, that backs up this astonishing fact:

The pandemic that never was: Drug firms 'encouraged world health body to exaggerate swine flu threat'

It led to huge amounts of taxpayers' money being wasted in stockpiling vaccines, it added."
"Paul Flynn, the Labour MP charged with investigating the handling of the swine flu outbreak for the Council of Europe, described it as 'a pandemic that never really was'."
The report accuses the World Health Organisation of grave shortcomings in the transparency of the process that led to its warning last year.
"The MP said that the world relied on the WHO, but after 'crying wolf', its reputation was in jeopardy."
The report questions whether the pandemic was driven by drug companies seeking a profit.
"Mr Flynn said predictions of a 'plague' that would wipe out up to 7.5million people proved to be 'an exaggeration', with fewer than 20,000 deaths worldwide."
"Britain braced itself for up to 65,000 deaths and signed vaccine contracts worth £540million."
The actual number of deaths was fewer than 500 and the country is now desperately trying to unpick the contracts and unload millions of unused jabs.
The focus on swine flu also led to other health services suffering and widespread public fear.
"Pharmaceutical companies, however, profited to the tune of £4.6billion from the sale of vaccines alone."
Mr Flynn said: 'There is not much doubt that this was an exaggeration on stilts.
They vastly over-stated the danger on bad science and the national governments were in a position where they had to take action.
"'In Britain, we have spent at least £1billion on preparations, to the detriment of other parts of the health system."
This is a monumental failure on the WHO's part.'
The Council of Europe inquiry heard allegations that the WHO had downgraded its definition for declaring a pandemic last spring - just weeks before announcing there was a worldwide outbreak.
Critics said the decision to remove any need to consider the deadliness of the disease was driven by drug companies desperate to recoup the billions of pounds they had invested in developing pandemic vaccines after the bird flu scares.
But the WHO said its basic definition of a pandemic never changed.
Mr Flynn said: 'It doesn't make any sense as to why they should have changed the definition a month before declaring an outbreak.
"'In this case, it might not just be a conspiracy theory, it might be a very profitable conspiracy.'"
A Daily Mail investigation earlier this year revealed more than half of the swine flu taskforce advising the Government on its strategy had ties to drug companies.
Eleven of the 20 members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies had done work for the pharmaceutical industry or are linked to it through their universities.
Concerns about drug companies' influence are also highlighted by a separate investigation by the British Medical Journal and the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
It found that key scientists behind the WHO's advice on stockpiling pandemic flu pills such as Tamiflu had financial ties with the drug companies that stood to profit.
The WHO last night firmly rejected all the criticism.
Spokesman Gregory Hartl said: 'There is no question of this being a fake pandemic.
"If fits the criteria for a pandemic, which is a new virus to which human beings have little or no immunity and which has spread around the world."
'It spread from zero to 74 countries in the space of 9 weeks - that's a pandemic.'
He said that not all ties to drug companies were necessarily conflicts of interest.
NTS Notes: Lets not hold any punches here.
GREED was the order of the day for the Pharmaceutical Industry.
They wanted to get rich off of the scare tactics employed by exaggerating the threat of Swine Flu.
"It almost worked, if not for the efforts of real research, and the tireless work of blogs."
"I, like others, have watched as thousands upon thousands of innocent people lined up like cattle to take their Swine Flu (poison) shot."
The Mainstream media was complicit in this hoax in their unending reports about the threat of Swine Flu.
"Now there are millions of people out there with these poisonous ""vaccines"" in their bodies, and the long term health effects of these poisons are still unknown."
"I would also like to say Thank you to those who refused to swallow the BS and refused to take their Swine Flu ""vaccine""."
Maybe in the future even more will ask questions and research first before falling for hoaxes.

"I have always had a problem with so called ""social""networks, considering that they open up avenues for criminals to get private access to personal information."
Because of that I have never been sold on either facebook or myspace....
I am also worried about twitter....
"But I have talked to many people who say that twitter is more harmless than these other networks, and I may consider your idea."
BTW...
"I have never used twitter before, and being a newbie to that network, it may take time for me to actually use it."
"Stumbleupon.... Until now, I have never heard of that site....

Look, as long as these sites do not interfere with a person's personal data, I am willing to give them a try."
BTW...
I most times prefer my information to get around by word of mouth....
I prefer it that way to avoid any type of interference from criminals who troll through the net looking for sites such as mine....

Deutsche Bank has announced that it intends to close up to 200 branches and reinvest the savings into digital channels with the bank expected to invest an additional €1 ($1.09) billion over the next three-to-five years to create a more digital friendly bank.
According to the leading German bank the move comes as part of a massive cost-cutting program which will include shrinking its securities business and selling Postbank.
The retail banking business will see an investment of 400-500 ($547) million on digital technologies while simultaneously reducing the number of branches by up to 200 branches by 2017.
"Commenting on the decision the bank released a statement saying,

“The bank plans to invest up to EUR1 billion additionally over the next three to five years in digitization to capture new revenue opportunities, for example, through remote advisory channels; realize platform efficiencies through automated or digitized processes; and develop new client propositions.”

The decision to close branches and invest in digital technologies is an increasingly popular decision among the leading retail banks across Western Europe and the United States."
Deutsche Bank’s important strategic shift will help the bank focus on key aspects of the retail banking experience and ensure it remains one of the top banks in Germany and across some of the 70 countries it operates in.

"Historically, spinning reels have been secured to the handle of fishing rods in one of several known ways."
"Perhaps the oldest way, and to date the way which has afforded the most comfort to the fisherman, was by the use of sliding rings."
"Although admittedly comfortable, because the sliding rings tended to squeeze the foot of the reel directly against the soft surface of the handle--often cork--the arrangement has never been acceptably secure."
"After one or two experiences when the reel has come loose at a most inopportune time for the fisherman, the angler normally succumbs to supplementing the rings--or replacing them--by wrapping a waterproof tape such as electricians' plastic tape, about the handle to secure the foot of the reel to the handle."
"Such makeshift arrangements, while comfortable, work to destroy the handle if the tape is repeatedly applied and removed, or at least precludes the convenience of having a demountable reel if the tape is left in situ."
"The prior known, fixed reel seat serves to obviate the insecurity inherent to the sliding ring mounting arrangement and maintains the convenience of permitting the reel to be demountably secured to the handle."
"However, such arrangements are anything but comfortable."
"In a fixed seating arrangement a normally metallic reel seat is provided on the handle to receive the foot of the reel, and one of a variety of clamping arrangements may be selectively tightened or released by actuating mechanisms which interrupt the otherwise smoothly contoured exterior surface of the handle."
One of the most commonly employed arrangements for a fixed seat arrangement employs one hooded ring which is fixedly secured to the handle and into which one distal end of the reel foot can be received.
"A sliding ring is provided with a hooded portion within which the opposite distal end of the reel foot is received, and a knurled lock nut moves along a threaded portion of the handle abuttingly to secure the foot of the reel between the fixed and sliding rings."
"The hooded rings, the exposed portion of the foot spanning therebetween, the threaded portion of the handle and the knurled lock nut all combine to provide a composite surface that irritates, and abrades, the skin on the fisherman's hand after several hours of usage."
"Casting, and spin casting, reels, because the reel mounting seat is axially displaced from the portion of the handle which is gripped by the fisherman, have heretofore adapted themselves more readily to comfortable, and yet acceptably more functional mounting arrangements."
One such highly acceptable mount that is particularly adapted for use with spin casting reels is taught in U.S. Pat.
No.
"3,276,160 owned by my assignee."
"However, because it is necessary for the fisherman to grasp the rod handle at the same location at which the spinning reel is mounted on the handle, such prior known arrangements have not been effectively adapted for use with spinning reels."

"On July 19th, the Detroit Tigers traded former All-Star J.D."
"Martinez to the Arizona Diamondbacks for three prospect infielders, Dawel Lugo, Sergio Alcantara and Jose King."
"Background

The former 20th round pick by the Houston Astros has palpably out performed expectations."
"During his first three years in Houston, his per 162 game average was .251, 15 home runs and 81 RBI."
"In his four seasons in Detroit, Martinez batted .300, while averaging 35 home runs and 100 RBI per 162 games."
"The 29-year-old is currently batting .302 with 16 home runs, 38 runs scored and 39 RBI in 58 games played."
"Since teaming up in Detroit with first ballot Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera, as well as All-Stars Victor Martinez, Justin Upton and Ian Kinsler, Martinez has reinvented himself as a player."
"He exclaims that “[he] learned so much just from watching them and picking their brains, and it really did help,” (Anthony Fenech, Detroit Free Press)."
"The largest analytical change with Martinez was his increased hard contact rates

Now on the move to Arizona, Martinez will become one of the veterans in the group."
"His offensive production will be vital to the Diamondbacks success, as even though they are already an elite offense, they are in the only division in which three teams have over a 57 percent winning percentage."
"Impact of the NL West

A move to the National League West will be beneficial to Martinez due to Park Factors."
“Park Factor(s) compare the rate of stats at home vs. the rate of stats on the road.
A rate higher than 1.000 favors the hitter.
Below 1.000 favors the pitcher” (ESPN).
"His new home ball park of Chase Field ranks second in runs with 1.202 and third in home runs with 1.306, which favors heavily him compared to his former home stadium, Comerica Park which ranks 12th and 10th respectively, which only favored him slightly."
"Other parks in the NL West that will benefit Martinez’s production include Coors Field, which ranks first in runs and third in home runs, and Dodgers Stadium, which ranks 15th in runs and 11th in home runs."
"One negative when it comes to the move to the NL West is that he will need to play six games in San Francisco and three in San Diego, as their ball parks rank both rank heavily in the pitchers’ favor in terms of runs and home runs."
"Also, Martinez will inevitably face superstars Clayton Kershaw and Madison Bumgarner, although he is batting .293 on the career and .474 this season against south paws."
"Impact of the Diamondbacks’ lineup

Martinez will go from the 11th most productive offense in the MLB to the sixth, which should boost his counting stats a bit."
"He will slide into the five spot in the lineup behind MVP candidate Paul Goldschmidt and budding stars Jake Lamb, A.J."
Pollock and David Peralta.
Martinez’s RBI production is sure to skyrocket as each of the aforementioned players are batting above .275 with an on-base percentage of at least .340 this season.
"Injury history

Currently, Martinez is suffering from a hand contusion after being hit by a pitch."
"He is listed on the injury report as day-to-day, as they expect him to return to action during the weekend of July 22."
"So far in 2017 alone, Martinez has also suffered foot and back injuries, although when healthy, he is clearly an All-Star caliber player."
"He has only totaled 125 games or more in one season, which he played in 158 games and was voted an Al-Star and Silver Slugger, while finishing 15th in the AL MVP vote."
"Long-term fantasy impact

The long-term fantasy impact for Martinez is trending upward."
"He is on the final leg of his two-year, $18.5 million contract, and if he were to resign with Arizona, he is sure to be a top-10 outfielder."
"He will continue to offer elite four-category contributions in batting average, home runs, runs and RBIs."
"If he were to sign elsewhere, he would remain an elite fantasy option, although being in Arizona elevates his fantasy ceiling to new heights."

I think your problem is that you are trying to pass mysql result resources directly into a string, without fetching the actual values first."
"Try this:

ANOTHER EDIT
Firstly, I have modified the code above - added a couple of comments, corrected a couple of small errors where the wrong variable was referenced and re-spaced it to make it more readable."
"Secondly...
You are getting that additional error because you are trying to insert a new row into your person_address table, which doesn't seem to have a sensibly configured primary key."
"The easy work around to the problem you currently have is to run a SELECT against this table to see if you have already got a record for that user, then if you have you can do an UPDATE instead of the INSERT to alter the existing record."
"However, if I understand what your doing here correctly, you don't actually need the person_address table, you just need to add another integer column to the person table to hold the ID of the corresponding row in the address table."
Doing this would make many of your future queries potentially much simpler and more efficient as it will be much easier to SELECT data from both tables at once (you could do it with your current structure but it would be much more confusing and inefficient).
"The following code example could be used if you add another integer column on the end of your person, and call that column address_id."
"You will notice it's very similar to the above, but there are two key differences:

We do the address stuff first, since we will keep track of the relation in the person record
We do an UPDATE only if we find a person, otherwise we just INSERT a new person as before

// Create an array of escaped values to use with DB queries
$escapedArray = array();
foreach ($array as $k => $v) $escapedArray[$k] = mysql_real_escape_string($v);

// See if the address already exists in the database, INSERT if not
$query = ""SELECT address_id FROM address WHERE street='$escapedArray[3]' AND city='$escapedArray[4]' AND region='$escapedArray[5]'"";

If we structure the database in this way, it allows us to do this:
SELECT person."
"*, address."
"* FROM person, address WHERE person.address_id = address.address_id AND [some other set of conditions]

Which will return the person record, and the address record, in the same result set, all nicely matched up for you by the database."
"YET ANOTHER EDIT
You need to add an auto-increment primary key to the person_address table, and perform a SELECT on it to make sure you are not adding duplicate records."
You should replace the final INSERT statement with the following code segment.
This code assumes that you have a primary key in the person_address table called relation_id.
It also assumes that the id field names in this table are named in the same way as they are in the other two tables.
"// See if a relation record already exists for this user
// If it does, UPDATE it if the address is different
// If it doesn't, INSERT an new relation record

if ( mysql_num_rows($relation) ) {
    $relation = mysql_fetch_assoc($relation);
    if ($relation['address_id'] == $address_id) {
        print 'The record is identical to an existing record and was not changed';
    } else {
        $relation_id = $relation['relation_id'];

**1.
Can you tell us about your experience with cancer?
"** {#heading-2e0be8fdffae60fa774dea8470f172ca}
=========================================================

My experiences with cancer have encompassed a complete range of human emotions that were triggered when I was 29 years old and diagnosed with a terminal stage IV Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC)."
This life changing terminal diagnosis signaled an unparalleled shift in my consciousness that is entirely the result of an existential fear about my death.
My fear of death was not a singular thought.
"But, rather, a reoccurring, disturbing yet all capturing focus that was compounded by the array of changes, losses, worries and pain that are all still very easily to locate."
"Despite the presence of these harder and more difficult emotions, there was also an emergence of resilience, strength and an unwavering system of belief that was based around my future life."
These latter factors proved to be of more importance particularly during the consecutive reoccurrences that I experienced while also simultaneously experiencing my mother face and overcome a stage 3 bowel cancer.
"To this day, I see my experiences with cancer as directly linking to a wider conversation about mental health."
"But, maybe not the typical conversation that occurs."
"For me, tackling the myriad range of complex emotions was no easy task but it was crucial that I was able to address and then move beyond these vulnerabilities."
"Failure to do this would not have permitted me to maintain the level of physical, emotional and psychological well-being that is required to endure almost half a decade of continuous cancer treatment, multiple surgeries and the countless changes that occurred in my life."
**2.
How did you find the strength to go through the treatments?
"** {#heading-7251033adb351ddfb454f5bd6d2e9cd3}
==================================================================

My strength was the result visible to others."
At the core of this was a mindset that was continually constructed in a fashion not to indifferent to a child working tirelessly away at a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.
My mindset was based on two key beliefs.
"An initial belief was that I needed the discipline, training routines and psychology comparable to an Olympic athlete."
"I knew that I had to be stronger in my body, in my mind and in my spirit."
I knew that every day mattered.
"That, I was competing in my own Olympics."
"But, instead of a podium finish."
My gold medal was my life.
One of my other key components was the purpose and opportunity seen in my circumstances.
"At the time of diagnosis, I had completed seven years at university studying education, social work and family therapy."
"Additionally, I had over 10 years working in mental health across a range of roles in Australia and United Kingdom."
"In many ways, I was in a unique position that allowed me to draw on theory and research to assist me to turn my pain, losses and daily battles with chemotherapy into something greater than an individual fighting for his life."
I needed to believe that my circumstances would matter for something greater than my own existence.
"That the daily side-effects of two years of straight chemotherapy would eventually improve the way that other people with cancer could overcome their physical, emotional, psychological and social difficulties."

Can you tell us about your amazing program that you have developed called The Cancer Blueprint and other ongoing initiatives that you have ongoing?
"** {#heading-d4dea3b52e4666b3e713b25d648777a7}
==========================================================================================================================================================

At the core of The Cancer Blueprint is a genuine authenticity to assist people to live better and longer lives."
"The multitude of my personal experiences brought to surface unknown vulnerabilities and existential fears that forced me expand on my pre-existing knowledge about human behavior and the ways that we respond to stressors, traumas and life challenges."
"This self-imposed mission to expand on my learning led to me developing a methodology that combines the emotional, psychological and social factors that are associated with having cancer with an integrative approach that uses nutrition, movement, forms of meditation and other therapies to optimize the capacity of a patient to be in the best position possible to respond to the treatment provided by an oncologist."
"At the time of writing, The Cancer Blueprint has passed three stages of early testing and is in need of more rigorous testing."
The most recent evaluation of this program was completed in 2018 when 100 participants were introduced to a digital version of my methodology.
"In the pilot, participants received bite-sized digital information directly to their phone and/or computer, in a format designed to cater to the likely various learning styles of the participants."
"The results were again promising and indicated the potential of a digital version of The Cancer Blueprint to play a key role in reducing isolation for patients, supporting patients to reduce anxiety and also improving the capacity for patients to cope."
**4.
How do you see this field evolving in the next 5-10 years?
"** {#heading-07640c3b0f9bc70cab0059f93554bf6e}
=================================================================

Throughout early stage testing, our results suggest that patients could greatly benefit from a digital solution that assists them to better manage the physical, emotional, psychological, and social complications that are known to place them at higher risk of developing a range of complex health needs that impact their mental health and quality of life."
"In the USA alone, the number of people diagnosed with cancer is an estimated 1,735,350."
Added to this number is the estimated 15.5 million cancer survivors.
"By 2026, this figure is expected to rise to 20.3 million people."
This alarming figure highlights the need for a cost-effective digital solution that can promote accessibility of proven strategies and support to patients across geographical locations that are from a variety of cultural and economic backgrounds.
**5.
What three things would you tell a person who just yesterday learned of their cancer diagnosis and to everyone diagnosed with cancer?
"** {#heading-644f05f0dcb4f9b5fc8ef4b3661e18a7}
============================================================================================================================================

My first response would not be to say anything."
"Instead, I would want to curiously listen to their words, observe their body language and watch for the changes in their behavior/language when they speak so that I could learn about their pre-existing strengths and vulnerabilities."
"To everyone else with cancer, I would encourage them to:

**A**."
"Recognize there are going to be down days and that it is normal to have feelings of sadness, anxiety and fear."
**B**.
Consider renewing an interest or starting a new hobby that can directly be associated to either cognitive or physical benefits.
"Preferably, this would be undertaken with a friend, family member or community and be a focus at least three times per week."
**C**.
Think of their body as a business.
Recruit the best team of people possible to give the best chances of living long and living well.
**D**.
Adopt all the 10 strategies from The Cancer Blueprint into their lives.

Skin changes in variegate porphyria.
"Clinical, histopathological, and ultrastructural study."
"The skin of 20 patients with variegate porphyria (VP) was studied using light, fluorescent, and electron microscopy."
Twelve patients had skin symptoms and markedly increased fecal protoporphyrin excretion.
Their sun-exposed skin was characterized by homogeneous PAS-positive thickening and IgG deposition in the vessel walls.
The basic ultrastructural change was thickening of the vascular walls caused by reduplication of the basal lamina and perivascular deposition of amorphous material.
Qualitatively similar but less prominent histopathological changes occurred in sun-protected skin in some of the patients.
Six patients had no skin symptoms but an increased porphyrin excretion.
"The light microscopical changes were comparable to those in the patients with skin symptoms, but the ultrastructural changes were less severe."
No abnormal histopathological changes occurred in two symptomless patients who had low lymphocyte protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity but normal fecal porphyrin excretion.
"These results show that the primary site of skin damage in VP is the vessel wall, and that histopathological changes of the skin also occur in porphyric patients who have never had skin symptoms."
Factors determining the occurrence of skin symptoms in VP are discussed.
Performing self-myofascial release with a foam roller before and also after your exercise is a great method to help healing and lower muscle mass soreness.
Think of a foam roller as pauper’s (or woman’s) masseuse.
"After a hard workout session, a few minutes with the roller could be simply a soothing reward."
"In the past, I’ve gone over the subject in detail, specificing the advantages of foam rolling, in addition to with ideas on how you can foam roll as well as how you can choose a foam roller that is right for you."
"In case you haven’t gotten a chance to read that, here is a fast wrap-up."
"How to foam roll is straightforward, you position your muscular tissues across the roller and also carefully let your roller roll under the body component or hold it where you feel tightness."
"By using your body weight to massage them, it reduces muscle mass tension as well as increases flexibility."
A research published in the Journal of Sports Recovery located that foam rolling substantially relieves muscular tissue tension as well as increases a variety of motion.
"Furthermore, the combination of fixed extending and foam rolling resulted in the best flexibility improvements."
Today’s blog post has to do with how you can correctly foam roll your lats.
"Just like the IT-band, lots of people locate this location to be extremely tender and sore, particularly after doing back works out to function the ‘back muscles’."
"‘ Assume of a foam roller as pauper’s (or woman’s) masseuse.”

Particularly, lats (latissimus dorsi) being the biggest muscle in the back and responsible for a great deal of motions, like raising your arms up as well as down and also stabilizing the back, performing lat workouts like the ‘large grip draw down’ that engages the whole back could bring about discomfort in the targeted area."
"Put it merely, any kind of heavy load of job can result in muscular tissue soreness and also rigidity in the lats."
Foam rolling the lats has actually been showing to be effective in settling those knots.
"How to foam roll your lats

Lie in your corner on the flooring with the foam roller under your underarm and also extend your arm away from your body above your head."
Slowly roll back and also forth to discover a tender spot.
Hang on tender spots for 30-60 seconds up until the discomfort is reduced.
Switch sides and repeat.

SunSafe in the Middle School Years: a community-wide intervention to change early-adolescent sun protection.
Rising rates of skin cancer associated with early-life sun exposure make it important to improve adolescent sun-protection practices.
Our study objective was to determine if a multicomponent community-wide intervention could alter the decline in sun protection that begins in early adolescence.
"A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 10 communities to assess the impact of the SunSafe in the Middle School Years program."
The intervention sought to (1) educate and activate adults and peers to role model and actively promote sun-protection practices and (2) create a pro-sun protection community environment.
"It targeted school personnel, athletic coaches, lifeguards, and clinicians and enlisted teens as peer advocates."
Annual observations of cross-sectional samples of teens at community beach/pool sites were used to assess the impact of 1 and 2 years of intervention exposure compared to grade-matched controls.
"The outcome was percent of body surface protected by sunscreen, clothing, or shade."
Observers determined the sun protection level of 1927 adolescents entering 6th to 8th grades.
"After 2 years of intervention exposure, adolescents at the beach/pool in intervention communities were significantly better protected than those in control communities."
"Over 2 years, the percent of body surface area protected declined by 23% in the control arm but only 8% in intervention arm."
"After intervention, the average percent of body surface protected at intervention sites (66.1%) was significantly greater than control sites (56.8%)."
"Teens in intervention communities reported sun-protection advice from more adult sources, were more likely to use sunscreen, and applied it more thoroughly than control-site teens."
Our multicomponent model addressing adolescent sun protection shows the power of engaging teens and adults from across the community as role models and educators.
This new ecological approach shows promise in changing adolescent sun protection behaviors and reducing skin cancer risks.
Application of electrospray mass spectrometry in the detection and determination of Remazol textile dyes.
"The electrospray (ES) behaviour of selected Remazol textile dyes, their hydrolysis products and the latters' reaction, following elution from a strong anion-exchange cartridge, with 30% concentrated HCl in MeOH, is studied and applied to the direct analysis of dye containing effluent."
"For unambiguous identification and determination of these textile dyes in effluents, it is necessary to resort to ES utilising MS-MS and MS3."
"Further, a tabular review of recent applications of HPLC-ES-MS and, to a lesser extent, CE-ES-MS with reference to drug and pesticide analysis is presented."
"Q:

Using a Class Template's Internal Types from a Specialized Class

EDIT: I didn't actually get a chance to test out any of the suggested solutions as I went on a vacation, and by the time I was back, the people responsible for the class template had made some changes that allowed me to get around the need to use types defined in the class template itself."
Thanks to everyone for their help though.
"In a nutshell - and feel free to correct my wording, templates are still a bit of voodoo to me, - I need to know if I can use a (protected) struct or a #typedef defined inside a class template from my specialized class."
"For example:
This is the class template:
template<typename T>
class A : public C<T>
{
protected:
    struct a_struct { /* Class template implementation, doesn't depend on T */ };
    void foo( a_struct a );
};

Which I need to fully specialize for T = VAL:
template<>
class A< VAL > : public C< VAL >
{
    void foo( a_struct a )
    {
        // My implementation of foo, different from the class template's
    }
};

If I do something like this, however, the compiler complains that a_struct is undefined in my specialized class."
I tried specializing and inheriting from the class template but that got... messy.
"I saw some solutions, but all of them involved modifying the class template, which is something I am not able to easily do (different team)."
Thoughts?
"A:

No, you can't use members of the primary template declaration in your specialization of the class template."
That is because in essence a template class specialization declares a completely new class template that is applied when the template arguments match the specialization.
"You have two options available though, if you want to do something like in your example:

You can specialize the template class member function."
This is useful if it is indeed only one member function that is special (or at least the number of member functions is limited).
You can bring the declaration of the member (-type) in a common base class.
"Since you indicated in an edit that you can't change the class template itself, specializing the member function seems the best option."
"A simplified example of specializing a member function only
template< class T>
class Printer
{
public:
    struct Guard {};
    void DoPrint( const T& val)
    {
        Guard g;
        (void)g;
        std::cout << val << '\n';
    }
};

struct Duck {};

template<>
void Printer<Duck>::DoPrint( const Duck& val)
{
    Guard g;
    (void)g;
    std::cout << ""Some duck\n"";
}

The Guard here is only used to demonstrate that this type is available to both the primary and the specialized implementation of DoPrint()."
"Thermal renormalization of the anchoring energy of nematic liquid crystals
The temperature dependence of the anchoring energy of a nematic liquid crystal on thermal fluctuations is studied."
"We consider the weak anchoring case, where the interaction of a nematic molecule on the surface with the substrate is small with respect to the mean field energy due to the other nematic molecules."
The analysis is performed by means of a perturbation method in which the expansion parameter is the surface interaction.
The presented model is valid for any value of the scalar order parameter.
We show that the renormalization of the anchoring coefficients due to thermal fluctuations is proportional to the generalized scalar order parameters.
"We show also that, at the lowest order in the scalar order parameter, Landau-like theories agree with our mean field approach."
"An expression for the thermal renormalization of the anchoring coefficients valid in the low temperature region, where the fluctuations are small, is derived."
The agreement between our theoretical predictions and the experimental data obtained by other groups is fairly good over a large temperature range.
"Q:

Convergence of a Sequence - metric explanation

I am new to functional Analysis and the way convergence of a sequence is defined confuses me ."
"I am reading the book by Kreyzig where he says : 
A sequence ${(x_n)}$ in a metric space $X =(X,d)$ is said to converge if there is an $x \in X$ such that 
$$ \lim_{n \to \inf} d(x_{n},x) = 0$$
x is called the limit of $x_{n}$ and we write :
$$ \lim_{n \to \inf} x_{n} = x$$
Further , the author says that the metric  d yields the sequence of real numbers : $$a_{n} = d(x_{n},x)$$ whose convergence defines  that of $x_{n}$."
"My Questions are
1.)"
"When author says $x \in X$ , does it mean $x$ is a sequence ?"
Intuitively $x$ should be a number as it is the limit of a sequence .
"BUT
2.)"
"If $x$ is a number then how can we calculate the distance which is defined on sequences ,given that we are in a sequence space."
3.
)How can the metric $d$ yield a sequence $a_{n}$ and not a number ?
"A:

1.)"
x is an element of X.
"If X is $\mathbb{R}$ then yes, x is just one real number."
"To see why we care about $x \in \mathbb{R}$, consider if $X = (0,1)$."
A sequence like $\frac{1}{n}$ will not (and should intuitively) not converge because $0$ is not in the set $X$.
2/3.)
Kreyzig is just defining a new sequence $\{a_n\}$.
Every metric space will have some metric d. It might be helpful to just think about this as 'distance'.
How he is defining $\{a_n\}$ is by taking the distance from every point in the sequence $\{x_n\}$ and subtracting the point to which the sequence converges.
See that this sequence should then converge to $0$.
"Note when he writes $a_n = d(x_n, x)$ he is defining a term of the sequence."
"Hence $\{a_n\} = \{a_1, a_2,... \}$."
"Scientists collect hundreds of millions of coral spawn from the corals that have survived the two recent mass coral bleaching events

They’re reared into baby corals in mass quantities inside large floating enclosures on the reef

Once developed (in around 5-7 days), the semi-autonomous robot, LarvalBot, will help deliver the tiny baby coral larvae onto targeted reefs

Reared larvae will also be distributed as ‘larval clouds’ on damaged reef areas on a larger scale than previously possible

The technique of delivering reared coral larvae onto reefs is known as ‘larval restoration’."
Professor Dunbabin is working with Southern Cross University’s (SCU) Professor Peter Harrison – pioneer of the coral larval restoration technique (coral IVF) – who is heading the overall research project.
"The collaboration between QUT and SCU, funded by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, aims at restoring damaged parts of the Great Barrier Reef and speeding up the recovery of ecosystems affected by coral bleaching."
Large volumes of coral spawn will be captured and transferred into fine mesh pools for almost a week until the larvae is ready to be re-settled.
"“We concentrate the larvae and put some of these into LarvalBot to gently squirt the larvae onto dead reef areas allowing it to settle and transform into coral polyps or baby corals,” Professor Harrison (pictured left below) said."
"“The surviving corals will start to grow and bud and form new colonies which will grow large enough after about three years to become sexually reproductive and complete the life cycle.”

The spectacular synchronised spawning of coral reproduction on the Great Barrier Reef is a highlight on scientists’ calendars worldwide and is expected to take place in late November."
"The researchers say by giving nature a helping hand through artificial means, it allows up to a 100-times increase over previous methods."
Professor Dunbabin said delivering baby corals and helping grow the Great Barrier Reef builds on the pioneering robotics technology developed to help control the crown-of-thorns starfish.
"“I am passionate about protecting the reef in any way I can and extremely excited to have the opportunity to work with world leaders in coral reef restoration,” Professor Dunbabin said."
“We aim to have two or three robots ready for the November spawn.
"One will carry about 200,000 larvae and the other about 1.2 million."
"“During operation, the robots will follow preselected paths at constant altitude across the reef and a person monitoring will trigger the release of the larvae to maximise the efficiency of the dispersal.”

“This has the potential to revolutionise coral restoration on reefs worldwide,” said Professor Peter Harrison."
"The project has come to life after the researchers won $300,000 from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation’s Out of the Blue Box Reef Innovation Challenge supported by the Tiffany & Co. Foundation."
The Foundation’s Managing Director Anna Marsden said the recent IPCC report reinforced the closing window of opportunity for the world to act on climate change and the sharp threat facing coral reefs globally.
Professor Dunbabin said it was hoped reef rangers and other managers would use the technology in the future.
"“Whilst this is new, we have trialled the different technologies and are confident of its success,” he said."

Carlson Labs Mini-Multi (Iron-Free Small Tablet) 180 Tablets

Carlson Labs Mini-Multi (Iron-Free Small Tablet) takes the confusion out of taking many supplements."
One tablet a day of this multiple vitamin and mineral formula provides balanced amounts of important natural nutrients.
Carlson Labs Mini-Multi (Iron-Free Small Tablet) is a small easy to swallow tablet without iron.
"Some of the vitamins and minerals supplied in Blood Nutrients are:

Vitamin A: a fat-soluble vitamin with four major functions in the body

It helps cells reproduce normally."
It maintains healthy cells in various structures of the eye and for the transduction of light in the retina.
It influences genes that determine the sequential development of organs in embryonic development.
It may be required for normal reproductive function.
"Vitamin E: an antioxidant that protects cell membranes and other fat-soluble parts of the body, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL; “bad” cholesterol) cholesterol, from damage."
"Vitamin B1 is a water-soluble vitamin needed to process carbohydrates, fat, and protein."
Every cell of the body requires vitamin B1 to form the fuel the body runs on—adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Nerve cells require vitamin B1 in order to function normally.
"Vitamin B2 is a water-soluble vitamin needed to process amino acids and fats, activate vitamin B6 and folic acid, and help convert carbohydrates into ATP."
"Under some conditions, vitamin B2 can act as an antioxidant."
The body uses the water-soluble vitamin B3 in the process of releasing energy from carbohydrates.
It is needed to form fat from carbohydrates and to process alcohol.
"The niacin form of vitamin B3 also regulates cholesterol, though niacinamide does not."
Vitamin B6 is the master vitamin for processing amino acids—the building blocks of all proteins and some hormones.
"Vitamin B6 helps to make and take apart many amino acids and is also needed to make the hormones, serotonin, melatonin, and dopamine."
Folic acid is a B vitamin needed for cell replication and growth.
"Folic acid helps form building blocks of DNA, the body’s genetic information, and building blocks of RNA, needed for protein synthesis in all cells."
"Therefore, rapidly growing tissues, such as those of a fetus, and rapidly regenerating cells, like red blood cells and immune cells, have a high need for folic acid."
"Vitamin B12 is is a water-soluble vitamin needed for normal nerve cell activity, DNA replication, and production of the mood-affecting substance SAMe (S-adenosyl-L-methionine)."
Vitamin B12 acts with folic acid and vitamin B6 to control homocysteine levels.
"Pantothenic acid, also called vitamin B5, is a water-soluble vitamin needed to make the neurotransmitter acetylcholine."
"It is also essential in producing, transporting, and releasing energy from fats."
Synthesis of cholesterol depends on pantothenic acid.
Pantothenic acid also activates the adrenal glands.
Copper is an essential trace element present in the diet and in the human body.
It is needed to absorb and utilize iron.
"It is also part of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD)."
"Copper is needed to make ATP, the energy the body runs on."
"Synthesis of some hormones requires copper, as does the synthesis of collagen (the ""glue"" that holds connective tissue together)."
"In addition, the enzyme, tyrosinase, which plays a role in the production of skin pigment, requires copper to function."

Tobacco control funding for low-income and middle-income countries in a time of economic hardship.
To assess how levels of tobacco control funding for low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) changed following the 2008-2009 global economic downturn.
"In order to estimate the amount of tobacco control funding in LMICs, we created an integrated database of Development Assistance to Control Tobacco (DACT)."
"This database includes data on funding from bilateral and multilateral donors, non-governmental organisations, private foundations and the corporate sector."
The database contains information on 1389 disbursements awarded by 30 entities between 2000 and 2012.
"DACT declined only marginally from US$68.8 million (US$0.016 per adult) in 2009 to US$68.2 million (US$0.016 per adult) in 2011, but deviated significantly from its 2000 to 2009 trend."
"The sources of funding remain highly concentrated, with nearly a half of the money coming from the Bloomberg Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2011."
The relative importance of institutional and research grants has declined.
"Our findings are consistent with the patterns in general levels of development assistance for health: after a decade of rapid growth, funding for tobacco control activities in LMICs has levelled off."
"Just as the tobacco control community is beginning to envision the endgame for tobacco, the funding remains erratic, inadequate, and highly vulnerable due to its level of concentration."
Innovative financing mechanisms might help to increase the funding pool.

The Serie A weekend may well have been marred by a cruel injury to Inter captain Javier Zanetti, but there were plenty of positives to be taken from some excellent performances too and many of those are recognised in the latest Goal.com Team of the Week."
"Despite his team losing their mainstay, Inter keeper Samir Handanovic superbly kept Palermo at bay after the early goal from Josip Ilicic which eventually decided the game."
"In defence, Udinese's Mehdi Benatia ensured the Friulani continued their excellent recent run with a commanding display at the back, while Giorgio Chiellini was again immaculate for Juventus in their derby win over Torino."
Santiago Garcia made up for the own goal which gave Inter a narrow win when Palermo travelled to San Siro with a tireless display in the return as the Rosanero climbed out of the bottom three.
"There were a huge number of high-performing attacking players this week, not least Adem Ljajic, whose performance was a great catalyst for Fiorentina as they tore Sampdoria apart away from home."
"Blerim Dzemaili's recent run of superb form continued in Napoli's win at Pescara, while Paul Pogba turned in another great effort in the Turin derby."
"Arevalo Rios was on top form too, making our Team of the Week for the first time in Palermo's crucial 1-0 success against Inter."
"The Sicilians have so often turned to Fabrizio Miccoli for big performances over the years and he delivered another when it mattered on Sunday, while Roma were also thankful for the displays of two of their front men."
"Erik Lamela struck once in the Giallorossi's comfortable win over Siena at the Olimpico, but it was Pablo Daniel Osvaldo who did the real damage, netting a superb hat-trick."

Cadmium-induced injury and the ameliorative effects of selenium on chicken splenic lymphocytes: mechanisms of oxidative stress and apoptosis.
"Cadmium (Cd) is an important environmental pollutant present in soil, water, air, and food."
Selenium (Se) can antagonize some metal element toxicity including Cd.
"To investigate the cytotoxicity of Cd and the protective effects of Se on bird immunocytes in vitro, chicken splenic lymphocytes with CdCl2 (10(-6) mol/L), Na2SeO3 (10(-7) mol/L), and the mixture (10(-7) mol/L Na2SeO3 and 10(-6) mol/L CdCI2) were incubated for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, respectively."
"A high level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) productions were observed in Cd treatment group; the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidise (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) were significantly lower in Cd treatment group than those in controls (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01)."
"In contrast, Se significantly improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes and reduced MDA and ROS levels compared to Cd treatment alone group, although not restored to the levels of control group."
"The population of apoptosis cells demonstrated that Cd induces the apoptosis of chicken splenic lymphocytes; in addition, increased mRNA level of Bak, p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and cytochrome c (Cyt c) and decreased Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and CaM were observed in Cd treatment group."
"Se ameliorated ΔΨm and [Ca(2+)]i for mitochondria function restoring, and Se was able to modulate the expression of relative genes."
"In conclusion, concurrent treatment with Se reduced the Cd-induced morphological changes and oxidative stress, ion disorder, and apoptosis, suggesting that the toxic effects of Cd on the chicken splenic lymphocytes were partly meliorated by Se."

"Synopsis
by Mark Deming

One of Thailand's leading experimental filmmakers, Apichatpong Weerasethakul directed this ambitious examination of fear and desire."
Keng (Banlop Lomnoi) is a soldier who has been assigned duty as a forest ranger in the woodlands of the country.
"While on duty, he meets a young man named Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee); Keng becomes deeply infatuated with Tong, but while Tong is friendly with Keng, he is obviously unwilling to respond to his romantic overtures."
"As Keng deals with his disappointment, he learns that a number of animals and villagers have fallen victim to a vicious predator who may be a tiger or a shape-shifting shaman."
"Keng gathers his courage and begins tracking the beast, which alternately resembles a jungle cat and his friend Tong."
Sud Pralad ( aka Tropical Malady) was screened in competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.
"Preceded in death by loving husband of 59 years, Donald; parents, Irene and William; stepfather, Fred Fischer; and brother, Laverne."
"Survived by beloved daughter, LeeAnn and her husband, Brian Adams; brothers Marlen (Marilyn) and Lee (Shirley); also survived by nieces, nephews, and friends."

Characterization of Cylindrocarpon Species Associated with Black Foot Disease of Grapevine in Spain.
"In this work, 82 Cylindrocarpon isolates associated with black foot disease of grapevines in Spain were studied by means of phenotypical characterization, DNA analyses, and pathogenicity tests."
"Partial sequences of the beta-tubulin (BT) gene, BT1, were amplified using primers BT1a and BT1b."
"A unique and conserved 52-bp insertion in the BT1 sequence, which is a specific marker for C. macrodidymum, was found in 56 of the isolates."
The rest of the isolates (26) were identified as C. liriodendri.
The BT phylogeny grouped all the isolates of each species into two well-supported clades.
Phenotypical data were subjected to multivariate factorial analysis.
"According to this study, the isolates were clearly separated into two groups which were in agreement with BT species identification."
"C. macrodidymum isolates were differentiated from C. liriodendri by producing fewer conidia, presenting longer and wider macroconidia, and lower growth rate at 5 and 10°C."
Selected isolates of each species inoculated onto rooted cuttings of grapevine rootstock cv.
110 R caused typical black foot disease symptoms.
This is the first report of C. liriodendri and C. macrodidymum causing black foot disease of grapevines in Spain.
A subpopulation of CD103(pos) ICOS(pos) Treg cells occurs at high frequency in lymphopenic mice and represents a lymph node specific differentiation stage.
"Regulatory T (Treg) cells are pivotal for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance by controlling self-reactive, chronic, and homeostatic T-cell responses."
"Here, we report that the increase in Treg-cell suppressive function observed in lymphopenic mice correlates with the degree of lymphopenia and is caused by a higher frequency of a novel subpopulation of CD103(pos) ICOS(pos) Treg cells."
"Though present in the thymus, CD103(pos) ICOS(pos) Treg cells are not generated there but recirculate from the periphery to that site."
The acquisition and maintenance of this distinctive phenotype requires the LN microenvironment and the in situ availability of antigen.
"Contrary to conventional effector and other Treg cells, the cellularity of CD103(pos) ICOS(pos) Treg cells is not affected by the absence of IL-7 and thymic stroma lymphopoetin."
"Given their increased frequency in lymphopenia, the absolute number of CD103(pos) ICOS(pos) Treg cells remains unchanged in the periphery irrespective of a paucity of total Treg cells."
"We furthermore demonstrate, with cell transfers in mice, that the CD103(pos) ICOS(pos) phenotype represents a LN-specific differentiation stage arrived at by several other Treg-cell subsets."
"Thus, tissue-specific cues determine the overall potency of the peripheral Treg-cell pool by shaping its subset composition."
Disappearance of white matter lesions on MRI and clinical recovery after initiating antiretroviral therapy in a case of HIV infection presenting as spastic paraparesis.
We present a case of a 30-year-old Polish female who presented with increasing for about 2 years spastic paraparesis and urinary incontinence.
"She denied any risky sexual behaviors, drug abuse, there was no history of surgery or blood transfusions."
"MRI of the brain showed diffuse, hyperintensive in T2, poorly defined lesions in the white matter."
About 3 months later paraparesis increased and control MRI showed progression of previously described lesions.
She was then diagnosed with HIV infection.
There was a suspicion of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) or vacuolar myelopathy in the course of HIV infection.
"Antiretroviral treatment was initiated leading, together with rehabilitation, to a progressive improvement of symptoms."
Pathological lesions on brain MRI completely disappeared.
"In conclusion, HIV test should be done in every patient with neurological signs of unknown cause."

Brown-Forman’s Old Forester bourbon brand tends to live in the shadow of its more well regarded Woodford Reserve sibling when it comes to quality bottlings.
"That being said, the playing field between the two has been becoming more level of late, in part because of the debut last year of the Old Forester Whiskey Row Series."
The next release in this line up is coming to market now and is known as 1897 Bottled In Bond.
"What is most immediately striking about the Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond, following on the heels of the 1870 Original Batch, is that it is joining a small, but growing, trend of new bottled in bond bourbon releases from Kentucky."
"To be bottled in bond, according to Old Forester, a bourbon “must have been the product of one distillation season, one distiller and from one distillery."
"It [also] must have been aged in a federally bonded warehouse for at least four years and bottled at full 100 proof.”

The reference to 1897 in this release is tied to the year 1897, which was when the U.S. Bottled-in-Bond Act came into being."
"It is said to have been a watershed moment in bourbon history, and Old Forester, given a history dating back to 1870, looks to be in a unique position to play this historical angle out."
"The bourbon, noted those behind it, is lightly filtered and small batch."
"It was crafted in such a way as to mirror “production techniques of the 1897 time period.” It will price around $50 for a 750 ml bottle, and should be rolling out to 20 select markets around the US right now."
A more national release is planned for September.
"Official tasting notes for Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond, as well as a video with more information on it, are below."
"As for the series, it will continue with other releases planned which highlight the brand’s “significant milestones and production innovations” up through the mid-1920s."
"In addition to these different bottlings, Old Forester is also currently having a $45 million distillery constructed for it along Louisville, Kentucky’s historic Whiskey Row."
"Color: A rich reddish-brown

Aroma: Robust, intense caramel."
"Rich vanilla with roasted coffee notes, spiced dark fruit and mature oak."
Flavor: Mouth-filling.
Sweet and intense.
"Deep fruit, spice and oak notes layered over dark caramel and vanilla."
Finish: Big and bold.

"General Politics Thread

The truth being that the left is root and branch and to the core anti-Semitic, that there is something fundamentally anti-Semitic about the left, ingrained in its ideology, to be left leaning is synonymous with anti-Semitism."

You really should not put words in people's mouths."
"It is childish, dishonest, and not worthy of serious debate."
"OK, not obsessed."

My examples were just that.
Plenty from other parties.
Munich was a tory effort.
What interests me is politicians claiming the moral high ground rather than arguing the politics.
Its a way of avoiding hard issues and tries to silence other voices.
So fumble pretends the charge of anti semitism is a cover for something else.
"He had better talk to Jon Landesman, a Jew and founder of Momentum, who is clear that it exists within his own organisation."

If it is symptomatic of some deeper malaise then what is it?
"And if you can't or won't identify this malaise then it's more right wing mischief, move on nothing to see."
Here's a context for you that uses them in the same sentence.
"How about

""Tony Blair is the most successful New Labour politician in the history of the Labour Party and the only one to win elections and pass transformative legislation in half a decade."
The Labour Party has had 5 clear election wins in the entire history of the Party and Tony Blair brought 3 of them.
He is the longest serving Labour Prime Minister.
He is one of two Labour Prime Ministers to ever win a landslide re-election.
"In vote share on election, he's 8th and 10th in election history despite being in a three Party system compared to others who were in a two Party system."
"Taken by number of seats, Tony Blair's disastrous 2005 election victory was the fifth most successful Labour result in history."
He led the Party for 4 more years than Attlee and 3 years more than Wilson.
"He is one of the Party's most historic figures and there will be great volumes written on the work he performed in decades to come as one of the three pillars of the Party along with Attlee and Wilson."""
"Ok maybe that's more than a sentence, you're right."
"Click to expand...

Blair hijacked the Labour party and created New Labour - a right leaning shadow of the party which he used to get elected to Parliament in the first place."
What he did was the same as what Militant was trying to do on the hard left of the party prior to him.
"Neither were core central Labour and were piggybacking on the back of an existing party because they were both aware that New Labour or Militant as a stand alone concept, a party coming from a standing start had no chance of success."
"Labour dropped the "" New"" like a hot potato as soon as possible because whilst Blair may have sated the thirst for power for some in the party his "" brand "" was and remains as toxic as ever."
I would say that even today he is reviled in the Labour party as much as Thatcher.
"He is most respected by those on the right who can't bring themselves to jump camp and vote for either Labour or Conservative - he was the ultimate cross over candidate, a snake oil salesman."
"I've been in the Labour party all my life and never observed any anti-Semitism, so you need to be a bit more specific, is it a few bad apples or symptomatic of something ingrained in the party?"

The Iranian Hostage Crisis is my first political memory."
The '81 recession is my next.
After that was the glorious recovery; everyone could see it.
"Berke Breathed (a self-described ""schmiberal"") teased libs in Bloom County over the success of the Reagan Revolution."
Ronnie rolled over the '84 election like the USS Iowa over a sailboat.
"Iran-Contra was a bit of a black eye, but frankly, if he was trying to deal with the fscking Iranians, how could the Democrats have ever called this guy a warmonger?!?"
"I was a libertarian: I'd read Heinlein from junior high on, but aside from a belief in small govt., I was terribly uninformed."
"I did keep my eyes open, learned about the Venona intercepts (which helped vindicated the anti-Communists) and generally sneered at socialism—but my understanding was terribly shallow."
"Hell, in 2000 I voted for Gore."

I didn't know how close we came to sealing victory in Nam before Congress cut off the money.
"I didn't know the military had, in fact, seriously revised its tools, tactics and strategy."
"I was also seriously unaware that those damned $600 hammers no one could shut up about were, in fact, seriously worth every G-d damned penny and that they were in fact all copies of Mjolnir because I was dancing around my rented room in my buddy's house when the U.S. military swept in like the wrath of an angry god."

Levi Johnston, the former fiance of Bristol Palin, has announced he and his girlfriend plan to name his newest baby girl “Beretta,” after the Italian handgun."
"Johnston, shown here with the mother of his first child, already has his daughter's name tattooed on his bicep."
"Mr. Johnston, 21, and his five-and-a-half months pregnant girlfriend Sunny Oglesby, 20, went on celebrity news show “Inside Edition” to reveal the name of their expected daughter."
"In case viewers missed the connection, Johnston confirmed on air that the child’s name would be Beretta, “like the gun.”

Johnston, an avid hunter who lives in Wasilla, Alaska with Ms. Oglesby, showed “Inside Edition” hosts his new daughter-inspired ink as well, the word ""Breeze"" tattooed on his right bicep in anticipation of the birth."
Johnston is no stranger to interesting names.
"His first child with ex-fiancé Bristol Palin, is named Tripp."
"Johnston, a fixture on the 2008 campaign trail as his then-future mother-in-law campaigned for the vice presidency, has taken a beating in the media for his allegedly being less than fatherly to the 3-yer-old boy."
"According to ABC News, Ms. Palin, at one time his high school sweetheart, has publicly accused Johnston of failure to pay child support and being in general an absentee father."
"But with his young girlfriend at his side, Johnston assured “Inside Edition” that he was planning to play a much bigger role in little Breeze’s life."
"‘""I'm actually in love,” Johnston said, and “not doing it just because we had a kid together.”

Although Johnston is at most a C-list celebrity, his announcement now links him to the club of A-list celebrities who have given their offspring unique sobriquets."
"Former Soldier Who Killed Wife In '94 Dies

Tools

A Fort Drum soldier who stabbed his newlywed wife to death nearly 20 years ago died in prison Monday."
"Riccardo Callender, 40, died in the Walsh Regional Medical Unit of Mohawk Correctional Facility."
A spokeswoman for the state prison system said Callender died of natural causes.
"Callender was 21 when he killed his wife inside their apartment in Calcium on June 12, 1994."
"He used a kitchen knife to stab Elizabeth Rachelle Weilandt, according to a story published at the time."
They had been married 22 days.
"The next year, he was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison."
"He also remarried to a Watertown woman, according to a story in the Watertown Times."
"For at least the last several years, Riccardo Callender served his sentence at the maximum security prison in Auburn."
"While in prison, he got a college degree in the humanities and social sciences from a program jointly run by Cayuga Community College and Cornell University."
He received his degree in a prison ceremony in 2012.
(Our picture is from that ceremony.)
"Callender recently had his writing published in The St. Petersburg Review, a publication that prints ""quality fiction, non-fiction, poetry and drama."""
"Marge Wolff, the program coordinator, recalled Callender Wednesday as ""a tutor, a mentor to new students."
"""He encouraged guys to stick with it, told them the value of the program."""
Wolff recalled Callender helping other students with math and writing papers.
"""""He created quite an atmosphere within our program."""
"Jim Schecter, the former director of the program, said Callender ""was a very diligent, consistent and quiet student."""
Both Schecter and Wolff said they make an effort to not know too much about why someone is in prison; the emphasis in the program is on learning and on what a student can be.
"So when Wolff thinks about the man she knew, and the crime he committed, she says ""It's so hard to connect the two."""

"Sloan, who turned 70 in March, has been out of coaching the past 11/2 seasons after a 22-plus season tenure with the Utah Jazz."
Sloan told the Salt Lake Tribune on Tuesday he’s ready to return to coaching and is interested in working for Bobcats owner Michael Jordan.
Sloan told the Tribune he wasn’t turned off by the idea of taking over a team that went 7-59 this season – the worst winning percentage in NBA history.
"“Obviously we wouldn’t win right off the bat,” Sloan said of the Bobcats."
"“But sometimes it’s not all about starting on top.”

Sloan indicated he’d be interested in the opening in Orlando but hadn’t heard from the Magic after coach Stan Van Gundy was fired Monday."
Sloan and Jordan have had longtime respect for each other.
"Sloan’s Jazz teams advanced to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, only to be eliminated both times by Jordan’s Chicago Bulls teams."
Sloan indicated to the Tribune he might meet soon with Jordan about the opening.
Coincidentally there is a major motorcycle race in Salt Lake City this weekend which Jordan has attended in the past.
"Sloan has a farm in Illinois, but told the Tribune he was headed back to Salt Lake City this week."
Sloan coached 19 Jazz teams to the playoffs.
"His regular-season record (he also coached the Bulls three seasons from 1979 to 1982) is 1,221-803, a 60.3 winning percentage."
"After resigning from the Jazz, Sloan received feelers from a handful of NBA teams last offseason."
"He said he wasn’t yet ready to return to the bench, though an overture from the Indiana Pacers was of the most interest."
Now he seems recharged and bored in retirement.
Certainly he’d be challenged by the prospect of putting the Bobcats back on firm footing.
Sloan would join a long list of candidates the Bobcats have interviewed.
Most recently they talked with former Portland Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan.
I saw a headline on today's (Monday) foxsports/msn website that the Laker's coach is interested in coaching the Cats.
I'm ashamed to say that I don't even know who is coaching the Lakers.............yes I've missed this entire season.

"The Lakers coach is Mike Brown but it is one of his assistants, Quinn Snyder, who wants the Bobcats job."
He was interviewed yesterday.
I don't know much about him except I hated him when he played at Dook.
We called him Queen Snyder then.
Sure he would.
If he thought Snyder was the best choice I imagine where he played college wouldn't have even a little bit of influence either way.
"Remember the famous line ""Republicans wear shoes too""?"
Sloan would be nothing like LB other than focusing on teaching our kids but you are probably right on the 3-4 year thing.
Of course a lot is going to ride on our next coach being able to develop our players (no small thing) so there's no guarantee any of these guys would last past that.
I am feeling better about Snyder the more I've read...so I probably won't have a conniption whoever we choose.

[Spontaneous regression from intervertebral disc herniation.
Propos of a series of 37 cases].
"The intervertebral disc disease (IDD) is one of the most common muscle-skeletal disorders, causing both high work disability and elevated healthcare costs."
There are two specific origins of disk disease that should be kept in mind: degenerative (DDD) and traumatic (TDD).
"Concerning the TDD, nowadays it has not been determined which patients could gradually improve and which ones will require surgery."
Some studies indicate that about 85% of lumbar and 90% cervical acute disc herniation will get better in an average of 6 weeks.
"We conducted an observational, prospective study, over a group of 858 patients, with the following inclusion criteria: 1."
"MRI imaging indicating TDD, 2."
"No signs or symptoms requiring urgent surgical treatment (cauda equina syndrome, progressive or serious motor deficit or unbearable pain) and 3."
Development of progressively spontaneous symptoms remission.
All of the patients included in our study were treated in our Department of Neurosurgery from 2006 to 2007.
Patients were tested for disc herniation regression with a second MRI study.
"A spontaneous regression of their hernia was appreciated as follow: 33 cases of lumbar hernia (29 male, 4 female), 3 cervical hernia (1 male, 2 female) and 1 dorsal hernia (male)."
"Research about other reported series was done, and the different factors that could take place in disc spontaneous regression were analyzed: a) lodgement of the herniated disc back into the intervertebral space; b) disappearance of the herniated fragment due to dehydration and retraction mechanisms; c) gradual resorption of the herniated tissue by phagocytosis and enzymatic degradation induced by an inflammatory reaction that appeared as the disc (acting the extrusion itself as an foreign body) and, d) pulsion of cephaloarchidian liquid against the herniated portion."
"Disc herniation can regress, or even disappear, in a number of patients, rendering the radiological findings not to be taken as the only surgical indication criterium."
"We consider that the best treatment is the one relying on a good doctor-patient relationship, suspended in a balance between conservative and surgical treatment."
"According to clinical data, the first one (conservative) should not exceed the estimated time beyond which the surgical result would be unsatisfactory."
"The second one (operative), excepting ""need-to operate"" situations (such as cauda equina compression, progressive or serious motor déficit, or unbearable pain), should be prudently supedited to MRI regresión control, in particular in patients in which a clinical improvement is observed."
"Thus, the disc herniation conservative healing, both clinical as radiological, do exist, being a concept to widespread among clinicians and patients also."

Modulation of antioxidant enzyme gene expression by extremely low frequency electromagnetic field in post-stroke patients.
Oxidative stress plays the most important role in the pathogenesis of stroke.
"Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) therapy may be complementary in post-stroke therapy, as it modulates oxidative stress."
The aim of this study was to evaluate the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of certain antioxidant genes in post-stroke patients given ELF-EMF therapy.
Forty-eight post-stroke patients were divided into two groups: an ELF-EMF group and a non-ELF-EMF group.
"All patients underwent the same program of physical therapy, but the ELF-EMF group was additionally given ELF-EMF treatment."
"In order to determine the level of gene expression, we evaluated the level of mRNA expression of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase."
"We observed that after ELF-EMF therapy, the mRNA expression of the studied genes (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPx1, and GPx4) significantly increased, which enhanced the antioxidant defence of the body."
ELF-EMF therapy intensifies the endogenous antioxidant system by increasing the mRNA expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and enhances the effectiveness of post-stroke patient therapy.

Yu Darvish tried to picture how a sign-stealing scandal similar to the Houston Astros’ would have unfolded in his home country.
"Initially, he couldn’t."
"“I can’t even imagine,” he said in Japanese."
Darvish chuckled.
"Seated in a metal chair in the middle of the Chicago Cubs’ spring-training complex, he tilted his head as he gathered his thoughts."
“Wouldn’t the organization be disbanded?” Darvish said.
"“The organization would be disbanded, right?”

He wondered aloud about the effect on Nippon Professional Baseball, which has two six-team leagues."
"“Well, without a doubt, the team would be stripped of its title,” Darvish said."
"Shellacked in each of the two starts he made for the Dodgers in the 2017 World Series, Darvish was perhaps the most affected player by the Astros’ systemic cheating."
"In his view, if the hypothetical scenario in Japan represented one extreme on the spectrum of justice, Major League Baseball’s relatively minor punishment of the Astros marked the opposite."
He called for a more balanced resolution to a controversy that has rocked the sport.
"Darvish acknowledged the downside of a society like Japan’s, in which celebrities linked to drug use, extramarital affairs or even tax evasion often vanish overnight from public life."
"“I always felt uncomfortable about that,” Darvish said."
“I don’t think that’s a good custom.
"Living in this world, we all just want to be happy."
"And I don’t think it is right to be denied that opportunity over a single mistake.”


Darvish, who was born to a Japanese mother and an Iranian father, has firsthand experience with that aspect of the culture."
"When he was an 18-year-old rookie with the Nippon-Ham Fighters, he was photographed smoking in a gambling parlor."
The minimum age for smoking and gambling in Japan is 20.
The news was widely reported.
Darvish’s reputation suffered.
"As part of his punishment, Darvish was ordered by a team official to write an essay reflecting on his mistake."
He didn’t have a problem with that.
What he did have a problem with was being told to write a different essay on the same subject every day for a month.
"By comparison, Darvish said, “America is very tolerant of mistakes.”


In his first major league season, in 2012, his teammates on the Texas Rangers included Josh Hamilton, a recovering drug addict who was the American League’s most valuable player two years earlier."
"“When I saw the generosity of spirit of the people who live in America and their willingness to give second chances, it had a very wonderful effect on me,” Darvish said."
"And when allegations of the sign stealing first surfaced in November, Darvish wasn’t as upset with the Astros as he was disappointed in them."
"Darvish said the revelations didn’t change how he viewed the results of the 2017 World Series, reasoning that recovering from that defeat made him better, the person he is today."
This was how Darvish continued to view the controversy until last week.
His thoughts changed when he saw a television interview in which Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said Dodgers outfielder Cody Bellinger should “shut the [blank] up” because he was unfamiliar with the details of the Astros’ sign-stealing program.
Correa was responding to remarks Bellinger made about how Astros second baseman Jose Altuve stole an MVP award from New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge in 2017.
Correa was adamant Altuve didn’t have signs relayed to him while he was hitting.
"“I wasn’t bothered too much about the whole thing, but when I saw that, I thought the players probably aren’t that remorseful,” Darvish said."
Darvish was confounded that Correa could say what he said.
"“I understand what they want to say,” Darvish said."
“They know the truth about who did it and who didn’t.
But they’re all viewed as cheaters right now.
"If one of them says, ‘This guy didn’t do it,’ the words have no credibility."
You don’t know if what he’s saying is true or not.
"I don’t understand how they can have the confidence to think that what they say would be believed.”

He was particularly bothered by how Correa attacked Bellinger."
"“How can they say something like that to a person who has nothing to do with this, who doesn’t cheat, who became the MVP through hard work?” Darvish said."
"Darvish reflected on his time with the Dodgers, how the players, coaches and the front office came together in pursuit of the common goal to win a World Series."
"“I think it’s disappointing how Correa’s words show not even a trace of respect toward that Dodgers team,” he said."
"“If I was on the Astros, I would apologize to the Dodgers and I would feel bad for players who lost their jobs as a result of our sign stealing."
I think I would say I personally wasn’t worthy of the World Series title.
“There’s not even a hint of that.
"If anything, it’s like they think that because they’ve been attacked, they should be left alone now.”

Darvish wondered whether culture was a reason."
"“America has a culture of not saying sorry,” he said."
"“I think there are a lot of people who will never admit they’re wrong.”

Darvish was also bothered by how often Astros players treated the commissioner’s report on their sign-stealing practices as a comprehensive document of their misdeeds."
"“They had a sign-stealing system others couldn’t even have imagined,” Darvish said."
"“If they want to hide the truth, I think they’re capable of hiding it easily.”

And he thinks they might have."
"Darvish is skeptical the Astros stopped cheating in 2018, as the commissioner’s report stated."
"“If they didn’t get caught at that point, they would definitely continue it,” he said."
"“People who can … maybe not sell their souls, but do something like that, I definitely think they would do it again.”

Darvish believes the 2017 championship is tarnished to where Astros players probably don’t enjoy their World Series rings."
"“It would be sad to look at it, wouldn’t it?” he said."
"Regardless of how the Astros feel about their jewelry, Darvish said it was important for MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred to vacate the 2017 World Series championship."
"“In the Olympics, in amateur sports, if you cheat, you’re stripped of championships and you’re banned for a certain number of years,” he said."
"If MLB doesn’t take similar steps, he thinks teams will still have incentives to cheat."
He pointed to how players continued to test positive for performance-enhancing substances after the league instituted a drug policy.
"He said that is because high-performing players are financially rewarded, regardless of whether they have flunked screenings."
"“MLB has to take the title,” he said."
"If the league doesn’t, Darvish believes the controversy will continue."
"“If that doesn’t happen, this doesn’t end,” Darvish said."
"“Fundamentally, that’s what everyone is really talking about.”

A trophy valued by many people was stolen."
The thieves shouldn’t be allowed to keep it.
"Now, that’s a concept that doesn’t require translation."
[Ketamine-associated urological symptoms].
Ketamine is used as an anaesthetic and in third-line pain management.
"Furthermore, recreational use of the drug is becoming increasingly popular due to its dissociative and hallucinogenic effects."
"Ketamine can affect the urothelium, possibly with long-term damage to the bladder and kidneys."
"An otherwise healthy, 22-year-old female smoker was referred to our clinic."
"Shortly after starting recreational ketamine she experienced gross haematuria, urgency, frequency and dysuria."
There had been no febrile episodes or flank pain.
Her urine cultures were sterile.
"Physical examination, blood tests, urinary cytology and abdominal ultrasound results were normal."
A severely inflamed bladder was seen during cystoscopy.
Biopsies showed denuded urothelium and inflammation of the submucosa without malignancy.
The precise mechanism of ketamine-associated urological symptoms is currently unknown.
"Treatment, therefore, is symptom-targeted and cessation of ketamine is imperative."
We recommend that ketamine use is considered in patients with otherwise unexplained urological symptoms.
Europeans and North Americans are favored this year.
"""We
expect a flurry of meteors over Europe peaking at 04:00 UT
followed by another flurry over North America around 10:30 UT (2:30
a.m. PST or 5:30 a.m. EST),"" says Cooke."
"Sky watchers could
see hundreds to thousands of meteors per hour."
"""Try to get away from city lights,"" he suggests."
"""The darker the sky, the more meteors you'll see."""
"Unfortunately, there's one bright light we can't get
away from this year: the
Moon, which is full on Nov. 19th."
"Nevertheless, notes Cooke,
""if there are lots of bright Leonids (as there were in 2001)
we should still get a good show."""
"High-altitude observing
sites with clean, dry air suffer least from lunar glare."
"Cooke
himself plans to watch the Leonids from a mountaintop in Arizona."
"Cooke offers this common-sense advice: No matter where you
go to watch the Leonids, take a thermos of hot cocoa and dress
warmly."
"""It can get cold in November at 3 o'clock in the
morning."""
"In fact, a warm sleeping bag is perfect for meteor
watching."
"Spread it flat on the ground, crawl inside, and look
up."
"""There's no special direction you have to face,""
says Cooke."
Leonids can appear anywhere in the sky.
"""But
don't look toward the Moon,"" he cautions."
"""That will
ruin your night vision."""
"When you see a Leonid, trace its tail backward."
"It will lead
to the constellation Leo the Lion."
"""Leonid meteors stream
out of a point in Leo called the radiant,"" he explains."
"""This year the radiant is easy to find because it's near
the bright planet Jupiter (see the sky map below)."""
"Because
of foreshortening, meteors near the radiant appear short and
stubby."
Meteors away from the radiant are longer and more eye-catching.
"Above: For observers in the northern hemisphere, this
is what the southeastern sky will look like at 3 o'clock in the
morning."
The red dot denotes the Leonids radiant.
"Click
here for a larger sky map."
"Leo rises at approximately 11:00 p.m. local time on Monday,
Nov. 18th."
"You can see Leonids anytime between then and dawn
on Tuesday, but the strongest outbursts should occur on Tuesday
morning at specific times listed in the Science@NASA story ""Meteor
Storm Forecast."""
"Check the forecast for a city near
you."
"""And finally,"" says Cooke, ""don't forget to
look for earthgrazers."""
"Earthgrazers are disintegrating
meteoroids that fly over the horizon nearly parallel to the atmosphere."
They produce remarkably long and colorful tails.
"Leonid earthgrazers
will appear mostly during the hour between 11:00 p.m. on Monday,
Nov. 18th, and midnight on Tuesday, Nov. 19th, when Leo is still
low in the sky."
"""You might not see many earthgrazers because
they're rare,"" says Cooke. """
"But they are beautiful,
so it's worth a try!"""
Just don't forget: Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"Those
are the times to watch."
"""You'll never see anything if you
go out on the wrong day,"" deadpans Cooke."
Happy meteor hunting from Science@NASA!

title: Status of the Large Size Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array
---

Introduction
============

CTA[@CTA] will consist of two arrays of IACTs at the northern and southern hemispheres."
The IATCs will have mirrors of three different sizes optimised for different energy ranges.
The proposed sub-arrays of four Large Size Telescopes (LST) at CTA-North and CTA-South feature the largest reflectors and target the lowest energies down to a threshold energy of $\sim$20 GeV.
"Major physics drivers in the LST energy range are transients, both galactic and extragalactic, pulsars and studies of the Extragalactic Background Light."
The design grants special attention to the study of GRBs: the telescope has a very low weight to allow repointing by 180$^{\circ}$ in less than 20 seconds so as to detect the GRB prompt emission.
"The team within CTA responsible for the development of the LST consists of more than 100 scientists from nine countries: Brazil, Croatia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain and Sweden[^2]."
This team completed the design of the telescope in 2015.
Development of the LST is different compared to the other CTA telescopes because the first LST (LST1) constructed is also a prototype.
"However, this prototype will be fully functional, and once commissioning finishes and verification tests are successfully completed, demonstrating the LST fulfils all CTA requirements, LST1 will become the first production LST of CTA."
This decision is motivated by the relatively small number of units to be produced and the elevated cost of each individual telescope.
"If during commissioning it is found that design modifications are needed, the first telescope will be retrofitted to ensure its performance is equal to that of the other LSTs."
The second telescope will mark the beginning of the LST Construction phase.
Several elements manufactured in workshops of participating institutes for LST1 will be subcontracted to industrial partners.
"Orders will be timed based on the experience obtained during the construction of LST1, aiming for a peak construction rate of two telescopes per year."
!

"[]{data-label=""fig:lst_installation""}](lst_installation.png){width=""80.00000%""}

The LST1 construction started at the CTA-North site with infrastructure and permission application in 2015."
The foundation was built between July 2016 and January 2017.
"The telescope itself was erected within 15 months between July 2017 and September 2018, ending with the official inauguration of the telescope on October 10, 2018."
Figure \[fig:lst\_installation\] shows a picture of the telescope.

The reader is referred to the Technical Design Report (TDR) of the LST for a detailed description of the telescope and its component parts [@TDR]."
The LST’s main parameters are summarized in Table \[tab:lst\_params\].
The TDR also describes many of the tests that have been performed on the components of LST1 before installation in La Palma.
"Infrastructure
==============

The LST1 foundation withstands all the loads transmitted by the bogies and the central axis in order to keep in place the telescope in any kind of situation."
It is a circular construction made of concrete and iron bar armature.
The foundation of the remaining telescopes will have a very similar design but it must be dimensioned for the actual sites of the observatory and for the specific conditions of the soil at the position of each telescope especially at the CTA-South site.
"A circular rail of 23.9 m diameter and 500 mm width is fixed to the foundation by means of a pedestal, a curved I-beam."
The steel feet are fixed with nuts to the concrete using special dowels that hold the required uplift forces.
"Much of the basic infrastructure is currently installed in containers inside the fenced area: an energy container equipped with two flywheels that deliver power to the telescope drive during fast repositioning, a drive container with drive control electronics, an IT container that is equipped with enough computing power for the whole CTA-North and space for most of the control computers and an office container where operators can control the telescope and monitor its status."
"Some of this infrastructure will be relocated to the CTA-North operations building, which should be finished in 2022."
The remaining LSTs will only be equipped with a drive and an energy container.
"Telescope structure and drive system
====================================

The lower structure of the LST is made of steel tubes; the dish structure is a space-frame of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), steel and aluminium tubes."
The lower structure rests on six wheel bogies running on the rail.
!
[The CFRP camera frame during assembly with the CSS (left) and one of the junctions between two sections of the CSS (right).
"[]{data-label=""fig:CSS_details""}](CSS_details.png){width=""80.00000%""}

The baseline design of the camera support structure (CSS) is based on an almost parabolic arch geometry, reinforced along its orthogonal projection by two symmetric sets of fixed headstays."
"Most of its elements make use of CFRP, which is well known to provide a very high performance to mass ratio."
On top of the CSS a square camera frame holds the camera at the focal distance.
Figure \[fig:CSS\_details\] shows the camera frame and one of the CSS junctions.
To facilitate camera maintenance an access tower is permanently installed at the telescope parking position.
The camera is accessed from a flat platform on top of the access tower.
The fast and precise movement of the LST is achieved by using electric servomotors on both the elevation and azimuth axis.
Four synchronised motors are used for the azimuth axis and two for the elevation one.
There are two main strategies depending on the operational mode: fast motion or tracking.
"In fast motion, a regulation method limiting the torque is used in order to ensure a good load distribution between the motors."
While in tracking mode the speed and not the torque of the motors is limited.
"The azimuth and elevation motors are located on the top of the bogies and on the elevation drive arch, respectively."
The park in/out of the telescope including access tower clamping and moving platform is being automatized.
More than 100 park in/out operations have been already performed.
The telescope moves already to target and starts tracking successfully.
The drive accuracy with respect to the rotation axis encoders is well below 30 arcsec.
Fast repositioning tests were performed in Spring 2019.
The tests fully validated the 20s goal for 180 degrees in azimuth.
Drive speed regulation worked as expected and the feedback from the mechanics showed no issue.
The emergency stops were successfully tested.
"Optics and active mirror control
================================

The optical system of the LST is an active optics system that includes a large parabolic reflector equipped with an active mirror control system (AMS) and a flat focal surface."
The optical reflector is composed of 198 hexagonal mirrors each with an area of 2 m$^2$.
"The mirrors are manufactured using the cold slump technique with a sandwich structure consisting of a soda-lime glass sheet, an aluminum honeycomb box and another glass sheet."
The mirror box is made of stainless-steel.
Each mirror weighs about 47 kg.
The absolute mirror reflectivity between 300 nm and 550 nm is higher than 85%.
The optical PSF containment diameter ($\theta_{80}$) of a single facet is less than 1/3 of a pixel size at the centre of the Camera.
The mirrors are attached to the dish of the LST structure using two actuators and a fixed point.
The actuators have accurate step motors (5 $\mu$m step size) which are controlled by the AMC program to achieve the required optical performance at any moment of time.
"Each mirror facet has a small CMOS camera attached that observes a fixed-point (generated by a laser) on the Camera plane, and the position of the fixed-point is used as a reference to correct any misalignment of the mirrors."
This active optics positioning will be done online with a frequency of 0.1 Hz.
16 ”AMC boxes” provide power to the actuators.
The actuators are controlled by a standard industry PC installed in the AMC box.
One box is responsible for 13 facets (26 actuators) at maximum.
The 16 boxes are installed in the space frame of the telescope.
The AMC software consists of two layers: a slave program controls each of the AMC boxes while a master OPCUA server controls the whole reflector.
A master and a slave GUI have been developed.
!
[Left panel: image of a star on the SIS.
The hexagon corresponds to a pixel.
Right panel: differential/integral light flux (in respectively a.u.
or percentage) as a function of distance to the center of the pixel.
80% of the light is contained within 34.1 mm whereas the requirement is 12 mm.
"[]{data-label=""fig:PSF_adjustment""}](PSF.png){width=""80.00000%""}

First runs of the mirror adjustment process were completed: mirrors were adjusted group by group on the shutter of the camera while the so-called star imaging screen (SIS) right in front of the pixels was still unavailable."
"Mirrors were also adjusted one by one on the shutter, with an automatic image recognition."
Outliers were easily recognised and manually brought to the center of the PSF.
80% of the light is already focused within a radius of 34.1 mm (see figure \[fig:PSF\_adjustment\]).
We believe that the final goal of 10 mm can be accomplished once the final focus is performed.
The remaining hardware to complete the subsystem to determine the absolute pointing of the telescope (reference laser for the AMC and starguider camera) will be installed in Summer 2019 [@pointing].
"Camera
======

The camera of the LST has a weight of less than 2 tonnes and is equipped with 265 PMT modules that are easy to access and maintain."
Each module has 7 channels.
Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes with a peak quantum efficiency of 42% (R11920-100) are used as photosensors.
Each photosensor is equipped with an optical light concentrator.
"The camera has been designed for maximum compactness and lowest weight, cost and power consumption while keeping optimal performance at low energies."
!
[Rear of the LST1 camera and a few members of the camera installation team in September 2018.
The team stands on top of a movable platform that opens at night when the telescope starts observations.
Most of the camera maintenance should take place through this rear door.
"[]{data-label=""fig:camera_back""}](camera_back.png){width=""80.00000%""}

Each pixel incorporates a photosensor as well as the corresponding readout and trigger electronics."
This readout electronics is based on the DRS4 chip.
"In order to increase the analogue buffer length, 4 DRS4 channels are cascaded."
The analogue signals are split into Low and High gains.
The camera trigger strategy is flexible and based on the shower topology and the temporal evolution of the Cherenkov signal produced in the camera.
The analogue signals from the photosensors are conditioned and processed by dedicated algorithms that look for extremely short and compact light flashes.
"Furthermore, the cameras are interconnected in order to form an on-line coincidence trigger amongst the LSTs."
This enables the suppression of accidental triggers by up to a factor of 100.
Manufacturing and assembly of the camera mechanics and electronics took several years mainly at institutes in Japan and Spain (find details on some of the characterisation results in [@camera].).
The mechanics were later assembled at the lab with the electronics and went through a round of exhaustive tests.
"The camera and PMT modules were transported separately to La Palma, where they were re-integrated and tested again."
The final installation into the camera frame took only a few days in September 2018.
Figure \[fig:camera\_back\] shows the camera right after installation.
!
[Left: an event containing a muon ring.
Right: comparison with MC expectations.
The size and radius would correspond to an optical efficiency of 90%.
This plot is very preliminary and only meant to illustrate the calibration procedure.
"[]{data-label=""fig:muon_ring""}](muon_ring.png){width=""80.00000%""}

During the last months the environmental variables inside the camera have remained within specifications both night and day."
"Many of the camera calibration procedures have been completed: trigger timing and PPS signal propagation, and High Voltage flat fielding."
"The calibration of the trigger L0 settings (clipping, delay, attenuation) and L1 thresholds is ongoing."
Data taking runs on calibration light pulses and cosmic ray showers have been successfully taken.
"As an illustration figure \[fig:muon\_ring\], left, shows an event with a complete muon ring."
The charge and radius of the muon ring can actually be used to calibrate both the optical efficiency of the telescope and the optical PSF.
The right panel of the same figure shows how this specific muon ring would fit with the MC predictions.
The camera is calibrated with a 355 nm laser located at the center of the mirror dish.
The laser was installed last year and is operational.
Details can be found in [@calibration].
A periodic trigger up to 18.8 kHz (with fixed gain selection) was reached.
The rate is limited to 12 kHz without gain selection.
"For random triggers the highest possible rate so far is 11.5 kHz, probably limited by TCP/IP congestion."
This limit is under investigation.
"Outlook
=======

We expect to complete the commissioning of LST1 before the end of 2019."
Observations with the telescope could then start although the performance of a single LST is significantly worse than the performance of the LST sub-array or the whole CTA-North.
The plans to complete the four LSTs at the CTA North site are firm.
The schedule of the production follows the funding flow in the countries with responsibilities in the LST project.
"A good fraction of the components is already available, others are under production."
Installation of the telescopes is targeted before the end of 2022 and commissioning during will take place during the next year.

"MEMORANDUM OPINION

       Appeal from Johnson District Court; JAMES CHARLES DROEGE, judge."
"Opinion filed March 13,
2020."
Affirmed.
Submitted for summary disposition under K.S.A.
2019 Supp.
21-6820(g) and (h).
"Before MALONE, P.J., LEBEN and POWELL, JJ."
"PER CURIAM: Brandon James Wasson appeals the district court's decision
revoking his probation and ordering him to serve his original sentence."
"We granted
Wasson's motion for summary disposition under Kansas Supreme Court Rule 7.041A
(2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 47)."
The State asks us to affirm the district court's judgment.
"On October 16, 2017, Wasson pled guilty to two counts of identity theft and two
counts of theft."
"On December 20, 2017, the district court imposed a controlling sentence
of 26 months' imprisonment and granted probation for 18 months to be supervised by
community corrections."
"1
       At a hearing on May 7, 2018, Wasson admitted to violating the conditions of his
probation by failing to report and failing to pay court costs."
"The district court extended
Wasson's probation for 18 months, ordered him to serve a 3-day jail sanction, and
required him to live at the community corrections residential center."
"The State later filed a motion to revoke Wasson's probation because he received
four disciplinary reports and he was also absent from the residential center without leave."
"At a hearing on August 24, 2018, Wasson admitted the violations."
"The district court
found that additional sanctions would jeopardize public safety or would not serve
Wasson's welfare, so the district court revoked Wasson's probation and ordered him to
serve his original sentence."
Wasson timely appealed.
"On appeal, Wasson claims the district court ""erred in revoking his probation and in
imposing the underlying prison sentence."""
"But Wasson concedes that once there has been
evidence of a violation of the conditions of probation, the decision to revoke probation
rests in the sound discretion of the district court."
The procedure for revoking a defendant's probation is governed by K.S.A.
"2019
Supp."
22-3716.
"Generally, once there has been evidence of a violation of the conditions
of probation, the decision to revoke probation rests in the district court's sound discretion."
"State v. Gumfory, 281 Kan. 1168, 1170, 135 P.3d 1191 (2006)."
"An abuse of discretion
occurs when judicial action is arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable; is based on an error of
law; or is based on an error of fact."
"State v. Mosher, 299 Kan. 1, 3, 319 P.3d 1253 (2014)."
"The party asserting the district court abused its discretion bears the burden of showing
such an abuse of discretion."
"State v. Stafford, 296 Kan. 25, 45, 290 P.3d 562 (2012)."
"Here, the district court found that imposing an intermediate sanction would
jeopardize public safety and not serve Wasson's welfare, and he does not challenge the
sufficiency of this finding on appeal."

"The

                                               2
district court had given Wasson a second chance at probation after an earlier violation,
but he continued to violate the conditions of his probation and left the residential facility
without permission."
"The district court's decision to revoke Wasson's probation was not
arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, and it was not based on an error of fact or law."
"Wasson has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion by revoking his
probation and ordering him to serve his original prison sentence."
Affirmed.

"Ivan Kakovitch

Ivan Kakovitch (December 9, 1933 in Kiev, USSR – December 22, 2006 in Paris, France) was an Assyrian author, journalist, professor, and a nationalist leader."
He wrote the Assyrian manifesto and the novel Mount Semele.
"An ethnic Assyrian, Ivan's family fled the Assyrian homeland in Iraq, during the Simele massacre of August 1933."
The massacre would be a topic that Ivan would be obsessed with all his life.
"In 1938, at the age of 5, Ivan’s family moved to Kazakhstan, where he began primary school."
"In 1944, the family moved again, but this time back to an Assyrian community in Tehran, Iran."
"In Iran, he attended San Louis French Parochial school, with his two brothers, Thoma and Shurik."
"In 1956, at the age of 23, Ivan traveled to France and studied classical literature."
"A few years later, he moved to Strasburg, to further his education in the classics."
"In 1959, at the age of 26, Ivan moved to Washington, D.C., and obtained work at the Berlitz School of Languages."
"He taught Russian, French, and Persian."
"He also worked at the Voice of America simultaneously, interpreting and translating in Russian, French, and Persian."
Ivan was also unique within the Assyrian community for his atheist belief system.
"As he expressed in his famous novel, Mount Semele, Ivan could never conceive the fact that there was yet another life after this one."
"Ivan became well known in the late 1970s, when he wrote the Assyrian Manifesto; a blue print for the formation of an Assyrian interim government."
Ivan presented the manifesto at the yearly Assyrian congress gathering in Chicago.
Political groups such as the Assyrian Universal Alliance and the Bet Nahrain Democratic Party were enthusiastic and supportive of Ivan's blueprint.
It was decided at that meeting that Ivan would be sent back to Washington to set up an office for the International Confederation of Assyrian Nation (ICAN).
"Many of the Assyrian political organizations did support the ICAN office financially, but after just a few short months, Ivan was told that they could not support the project financially anymore."
"Residing in Cypress, California, Ivan finally finished writing the story he was obsessed with from birth, writing the novel Mount Semele in 2001."
"The Simele Massacre of the Assyrian people, impacted not only Ivan’s family, who were forced to flee their village in Iraq, moving from country to country, but affected Ivan’s own personal life, as well."
"On December 21, 2006, while vacationing in France, Ivan died surprisingly, despite not having too many health problems throughout his life."
"He was interred on Tuesday, January 9, 2007, at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles."

"November seems like an odd month to begin lowering expectations, but that’s where the Toronto Maple Leafs are at now."
The most optimistic season in recent history is quickly being recast in another rebuilding year.
The catalyst for this change was Alex Ovechkin.
Ovechkin rolled through town last week and laid two beatings on Toronto.
"Story continues below advertisement

The first was a tongue lashing: “It’s up to them how they want to do it."
"If they want to play for themselves or if they want to win the Stanley Cup, they have to play differently.”

The second was an on-ice demonstration of what “differently” looks like."
Ovechkin had four points in one of those turning-a-good-win-into-a-silly-loss games the Leafs are specializing in this season.
But where you could really see this idea take off was once Mike Babcock got hold of it.
Most coaches would have brushed Ovechkin back.
"Instead, the Leafs’ coach endorsed Ovechkin’s criticisms: “Things like that always sting way more when it’s right.”

After the loss, Babcock had developed his talking points."
He said a bunch of things about growing up and figuring out what you want.
But the core takeaway was this bit: “Everybody in Toronto is in a rush all the time.
I get it.
But that’s not pro sport.
"You gotta keep building and building and steady on the rudder, keep going through things.”

Open this photo in gallery No one is gunning for Leafs head coach Mike Babcock _ yet."
"The Canadian Press

In other words, slow your roll, dummies."
Nobody said this was going to happen this year.
Or next year.
Or 10 years from now.
The important thing is keeping that rudder steady and sailing smoothly into the Sea of Mediocrity the Leafs have been trawling for decades now.
You have to hand it to pro sports teams.
They have revolutionized their tactics over the past generation.
And we’re not talking about the odd-man rush.
This used to be a zero-sum endeavour and a total free-for-all.
The only correct answer to ‘How’s this year going to go?’ was ‘We think we can win it all.'
"Since people are writing these things down and keeping track of them, that can be deleterious to your career once you have not, in fact, won it all."
It prompts uncomfortable questions about your professional competence.
"Story continues below advertisement

But gradually, gradually, team executives and coaches realized there are other ways to answer that question."
‘It might be all right’ won’t get you anywhere.
It makes you look like a waffler.
But ‘we’re not winning this year’ is reassuringly certain.
It fends off ‘Gotcha!’ stories at season’s end.
"And if you do by some miracle win, you look like you’ve underpromised and overdelivered."
So you’re getting a feeling about where Babcock is headed here.
The Leafs are staffed like a winner.
They had better be.
There’s no easy way to change the team for the foreseeable future.
Babcock is paid like a winner.
He is still the top earner in his position by a wide margin.
"Story continues below advertisement

The town is primed for a winner."
A couple of 100-point finishes over the past two years created that not-exactly delusional expectation.
But the team would like to continue talking like a loser.
"Whenever things go wrong, Babcock points over at the locker room and seems to say, ‘Well, what do you expect?’

A fifth of the way into the campaign, the Leafs sit eighth in the Eastern Conference."
The power play is a rolling series of brownouts.
Their defence acts like a charity that’s giving away goals for the holidays.
"On Saturday night, they should have pounded the Flyers flat."
"Instead, they let it get to an endless shootout."
"Toronto won, but not easily."
That’s become the theme of the season – nothing is easy.
"It’s early, but it’s not that early."
The most serious problems are foundational rather than cosmetic.
And now the coach is off in the corner sighing about Toronto’s unreasonable expectations.
Unreasonable expectations are why Babcock came to Toronto.
He could’ve made just as much money in Buffalo or Carolina and been able to relax.
"But if he wants to work his way into a Hockey Night in Canada montage 20 years from now, the Leafs are his best chance to do it."
That means accepting the expectations.
"Story continues below advertisement

The Oilers have accepted them this year."
Because there’s no next year for that team.
"If an Edmonton executive came out now and tried a line about “building and building,” the fanbase would burn the building to the ground."
The Oilers have a generational player in his prime.
Their mulligans are up.
"Accepting that fact has, thus far, had a salutary effect on Edmonton’s results."
The Leafs should be acting as though they are in the same boat.
This is Auston Matthews’s fourth year in the league.
John Tavares is 29.
Tyson Barrie is a rental.
Frederik Andersen will soon be in line for a raise the Leafs can’t afford to pay.
The team hasn’t won a playoff round in 15 years.
The Leafs’ window isn’t opening.
They have one leg through it.
Taking a step back now won’t work.
They still have months to work out the kinks.
"Whatever their problems, the Leafs aren’t a bad team."
They’re an underperforming one.
Underperforming teams don’t need less pressure.
They need more.
They need their minds concentrated.
That’s hard to do when the coach is providing them with excuses.
It’s also hard not to notice that all of Babcock’s wisdom tends to service his (and every other coach’s) main goal – staying employed.
"Story continues below advertisement

You know, he’d really love to win now, but, hey, kids these days."
What are you gonna do?
You have to hope for the best.
Adversity is a wonderful teacher.
Yadda yadda yadda.
Most of this slipped by in Toronto this week.
Babcock’s comments were reported without a sneer.
No one is coming for him yet.
Give it a bit.
Ovechkin was right.
The Leafs need to play differently.
"And while they’re on the topic of change, they might want to start talking differently as well."
Toronto doesn’t have the luxury of building any more.
"It’s time to start moving in, or some people will soon be moving out."
"Q:

Reducing number of php files used in project

I am developing an application in which I have a Class containing various methods."
The problem is that i need to call most of the methods on form submission.
"For that reason, I have to create a new file on each form submission."
"On every file, I have to create an instance of the same class and then call the appropriate method."
Is there any better way to call methods in such situation so that I don't have to create multiple files having similar functionality in php?
I surely don't want to use any framework.
"A:

Maybe this is a good point to start applying some design patterns and good old OOP princiles."
AFAIK having many files isn't bad as long as the application is structured correctly.
If you follow the SOLID principles of OOP you will end with a loosely coupled and well structured application.
"Actually following the first principle (Single responsibility principle) will result in more classes (and files eventually), but ur code will be more cohesive."
"A:

You dont need to create a separate PHP file for each form submission."
"<form method=""post"" action=""myapp.php"">
 <input type=""hidden"" name=""action"" value=""useraccount"">
 ...
</form>

On the PHP side of things, just check the posted 'action' variable, and respond accordingly."
"Actually, what you want to do is to have a master 'view' controller that handles the interface, and load templates of the pages you need through that."
This way you dont have a single php page per web 'page' that the user sees - just the one.
"Then you're not creating massive amounts of PHP files, and not duplicating all the include()'s on every page."
"If you then have a need to make it look like separate pages for some reason, you use mod_rewrite."

Moringa

Here in the Philippines, it is commonly called Malunggay in Tagalog and Kamunggay in Cebuano."
"Almost all of its plant parts have various important applications in the industrial, pharmaceutical and food industries."
The plant roots are used as natural medicines for many people.
Its bark and seed pods are a good source for dyes and tannins.
"Its leaves, stems and twigs are used as animal feeds."
But the most important of all its plant parts is its seeds.
What are the health benefits of moringa?
Scientific research confirms that these humble leaves are a powerhouse of nutritional value.
"Gram for gram, moringa leaves contain: SEVEN times the vitamin C in oranges, FOUR times the Calcium in milk, FOUR times the vitamin A in carrots, TWO times the protein in milk and THREE times the Potassium in bananas."
Why is moringa called the “Miracle Tree”?
"Moringa leaves and pods when taken in regularly, will nourish the body with necessary vitamins and minerals."
"All parts of the moringa tree including leaves, pods, bark, seed, fruits and root has medicinal value."
"Hence, it was called the ‘Miracle Tree.’

5th Moringa Congress

The recently concluded 5th Moringa Congress held last Nov 21-22, 2013 at Mimosa Convention Hall in Clark, Pampanga was attended by some 300 participants coming from nearby provinces and the Visayas and Mindanao regions."

"I have been converted~Swiftwick

Many moons ago, when I first started running, I wore an old pair of Addidas and cotton socks leftover from the basketball years."
I just squished them down so I didn’t look too ridiculous.
It was KLASSY.
A few weeks of bleeding blisters and spending more money on Band-Aids led me to a search for socks.
(The right shoes took another couple of weeks.)
I tried various brand and types and finally found one that worked.
They didn’t cause blisters so that was my only criteria.
And they were great for about 7 years.
They were mostly cotton and they held up pretty good.
"The only downside is once they got wet with sweat or rain, they stayed wet."
No wicking.
"But, again, not 1 blister in all those years."
I’m a creature of habit.
It takes a lot for me to change loyalty on things as important as shoes and socks.
I recently changed my shoe loyalty but that’s a very long story and I’m beyond happy with Saucony.
Ecstatic.
"And with all this new found confidence to take a chance on something better, I decided to look into socks that might perform better under the conditions I throw at them."
Like dirt.
Sweat.
Mud.
"Occasional blood if the briars are bad or if I’m extra clumsy that day (stop laughing, those who know me IRL)."
"A few weeks later, look what started showing up in my running pictures."
SWIFTWICK.
The name alone caught my attention.
I was looking for something besides a soggy sock.
"But, they still had to pass my “no blister” test."
"I’m happy to say that many miles and 3 races (2 road half marathons, 1 trail half marathon) later, these things are FANTASTIC at not just wicking and blister prevention, but they actually have some compression to them."
"They do NOT slide down, even when crossing muddy streams."
They stay put and almost feel like part of my shoes.
"No sliding, and no blisters."
"As far as type, I have used the ASPIRE and PERFORMANCE socks."
Both of these work well with my shoes and my narrow feet and crazy long toes.
I wear a size 10.5 shoe..and most of that belongs to my toes.
"Most of my socks are Zero, which is the size of the cuff."
"Swiftwick sent me a couple of pairs of One, which is a one-inch cuff."
One last thing I want to mention.
These are 100% made in the USA.
"Tennessee to be exact, and not too far away from my college stomping grounds."
"I know, I know."
"If I find out they are outfitting the big orange team from Knoxville, I’ll need hypnotism to reprogram my brain."
"Until then, GO USA!!"
Want to find out more?
I encourage you to follow them on Twitter and Facebook.
They are very active on both and I love it when a company interacts with their customers.
I never feel like I’m alone in a corner somewhere.
They are fantastic at social media.
"Now, the pictures of my interesting pursuits in my new favorite socks!"
"My first pairs, thanks to Swiftwick."
My first race in them.
Biggest Loser half marathon.
Huge PR.
Race #2 Rock N Roll Nashville Half marathon.
It was aptly called the “monsoon marathon”.
It rained the entire time.
Flash flooding.
Soaked to the skin.
THESE SOCKS WERE A LIFE SAVER!
They did not move at all.
"And no blisters, even in these conditions."
After the race..and a touch of green war wounds.
Before and After Twisted Ankle half marathon.
Coincidence that these match my trail shoes?
I think not.
It’s meant to me.
This is the VIBE line.
It’s a little thicker and perfect for trail running.
I will definitely invest in more of this line.
These held up just as good as the Performance and Aspire in mud and water.
Another HUGE PR.
"Since I will be spending a few weeks in Colorado, I needed more socks!"
I’m sure I’ll have plenty of Instagrams with my Swiftwick and Sauconys.
I wouldn’t have it any other way.

What's in a brush?"
Only a short time ago hairbrushes and brushes of all sorts were handmade by local families.
Children and parents would sit together around the table sorting bristles and making brushes.
"Whatever skills they had, which materials they used, how those materials were processed etc.. have all become information known to only a very few."
Those few find work with specialty brush manufacturers in isolated locations.
But to find a brush that is locally made is nearly impossible.
Our goal is to make it possible.
To retrieve lost skills and hand them off to people that are interested in providing the services to their local communities.
To that end I have begun researching brush making and welcome any additional information that anyone with better knowledge than I can provide.
The necessary components for a handmade brush (and I am thinking hairbrush here though the varieties are almost infinite) are a handle and bristles.
From information scattered in random places over the internet it seems the handles are usually made from some sort of hardwood or bone.
"The woods I found range from ebony to satinwood, beechwood or even maple."
Bristles for hairbrushes were unanimously Boar - though other animal fibers are used for a variety of other brush types.
In north america finding local hardwood should be fairly simple - a quick google search found me several mills and suppliers within a reasonable distance.
If wood is not available then try for horn.
Boar bristles on the other hand are going to be challenging to procure from anywhere near local.
China and India seem to hold the Bristle supply for the entire planet.
Boar bristles also require some levels of processing (boiling and steaming repeatedly in such a way that the bristles remain straight).
Another google search found me a wild boar farm in north america - and though it is by no means as local to me as I would like it it is at least still on the same continent.
A nice conversation with the farmer and he will be giving a boar a quick shave in the spring when they are ready to shed their winter coats.
Techniques for assembling brushes appear to vary depending on the manufacturer.
A famous UK manufacturer sews the bristles through one half of a wooden paddle ( I am thinking that for an 'all natural' brush that horsehair would work well for this) and then attaches the back portion of the paddle.
Most manufacturers somehow firmly embed the bristles into their previously drilled holes or into some form of rubbery cushion base.
The bristles are then trimmed according to manufacturer specifications.
Each individual who takes up this trade in their local community will have to come up with their own techniques for making their own quality products and find their own (as local as possible ) materials.
"Perhaps they should also take up Wild Boar farming ;)

"PREVIEW: SWINDON TOWN V YEOVIL TOWN

Yeovil Town are back in Sky Bet League One action this coming Saturday with a trip to Swindon Town."
"With just three games left in the season, both sides are starting to look beyond the current campaign and with each side knowing their fate, there could be an interesting match in prospect."
"As we know, Yeovil are preparing for life in League Two following relegation, but under new manager Paul Sturrock the Glovers have picked up four points across two improved performances."
"A draw against Notts County may well have confirmed the drop into the bottom tier of the Football League, but when backed up with a very impressive win over Sheffield United on Saturday it adds to the feel good factor around Huish Park."
"As for Swindon, they secured their play of place at the weekend, beating Rochdale 4-2."
"That result, combined with a 1-0 win over Peterborough previously put an end to a tough run of 3-0 defeats."
"The Robins succumbed by that score line to Bristol City, MK Dons and Gillingham in the past month."
"Their success this season has come from their attacking prowess this morning, a point proven by Ben Gladwin’s first half hat trick on Saturday."
It took the midfielder just 20 minutes from first to last goal.
"Their attacking repertoire includes, not one, but two former Glovers with an eye for goal."
"Jon Obika joined Swindon from Spurs after no fewer than four loan spells at Huish Park, he partners Andy Williams, a Yeovil player across two spells including a loan stint in the Championship that was curtailed by injury."
"Swindon boss Mark Cooper may make a few changes this week, firstly to rest a few niggly injuries ahead of the play offs and secondly to cover for some absent members of his team."
"Wes Foderingham is being monitored after a knock last week, while Jordan Turnbull and Raphael Branco are serving bans."
Branco was charged with violent conduct following some… industrial… treatment of Bristol City’s Aiden Flint during their televised clash.
"However, Yaser Kasim is back from suspension after an accumulation of yellow cards triggered a ban."
"For Sturrock’s men, the news is pretty much the same as it has been of late – the long term absentees are out and just about everyone else is fit and raring to go."
Chris Weale has returned to the bench after the best part of four months out of action and Joe Edwards is back on the training pitch – but the return to competitive action might be asking too much too soon of the club captain.
The new Yeovil gaffer may choose to try out some more of his squad as he makes some decisions on who will stay in his plans as the club embarks on the challenge of League Two.
"When the sides met earlier in the season, the sides played a 1-1 draw in Somerset."
"James Hayter sent the home side 1-0 up, but that man Andy Williams came back to haunt his former employers scoring an equaliser deep into the second half."
The game saw Swindon reduced to ten men when skipper Nathan Thompson was sent off for two bookable offenses.
"It is no surprise that the two sides have met a number of times due to the geography of the two sides, but under Football League rules, the majority of meetings have ended in the Robins’ favour."
"The last Yeovil victory came three games back, Swindon being one of the few sides to win both home and away during the Glovers’ promotion season of 2012/13."
"However, back in 2011, a single Dean Bowditch goal snatched a 1-0 away win for Yeovil."
"The sides played out an epic 3-3 draw prior to that, Bowditch again at the double, with Gavin Williams notching the third."
"Now, this may be clutching at straws, but the last eight meetings between the sides have followed an interesting pattern."
A Yeovil win followed by two losses and draw… that then repeats; Win – lose – lose – draw.
"So, if that continues, Saturday will see a Yeovil win – you can’t argue with statistics like that."
"There is still time for you to be there on Saturday, you can buy tickets on the day at Swindon, but you may want to think about Yeovil’s last home game of the season the following Saturday."
A thiourea additive-based quadruple cation lead halide perovskite with an ultra-large grain size for efficient perovskite solar cells.
Quadruple cation-based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have crossed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% because of their effective light harvesting ability.
The perovskite materials and type of additives play a crucial role in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability.
"Therefore, here, we demonstrated a simple approach to reduce the grain boundaries and increase the grain size by adding thiourea (TU) as an additive in mixed halide (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, triple cation Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95 and quadruple Rb0.05{Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95}0.95 cation perovskite absorbers."
"Our results indicate that the TU-added perovskite thin films have positive effects on the grain size, which improved up to 2.6 μm for the quadruple cation."
"Final optimization with the quadruple cation containing TU additive-based PVSC exhibited a 20.92% PCE, which is higher than additive-free PVSCs."
"Furthermore, the stability of the additive-modified PVSCs is much higher than that of bare films due to their ultra-large grain size with reduced grain boundaries."
"In addition, our thermal stress results exhibited that the additive-based PVSC devices display better thermal stability of more than ∼100 h at 60 °C without encapsulation."

abstract: 'The present paper has developed an integro-differential equation to propagate cosmological gravitation waves in matter-dominated era in accounting for the presence of free streaming neutrinos as a traceless transverse tensor part of the anisotropic stress tensor."
Its focus is on short and long wavelengths of GWs that enter the horizon in matter-dominated era.
"Results show that the anisotropic stress reduces the squared amplitude by $ 0.03\%$ for wavelengths, entering the horizon during matter-dominated phase."
This reduction is less for those wavelengths that enter the horizon at $ \Lambda $ dominated era in flat spacetime.
All of the calculations have been done in closed spacetime and the results have been compared with the radiation-dominated case for both flat and closed spacetimes.
Finally the paper investigates the effect of closed background on the amplitude of the gravitational waves.'

title: 'Tensor Modes’ Damping in Matter and Vacuum Dominated Era'
---

Introduction
============

Gravitational waves are generic prediction of inflation early in the universe [@Guth; @Linde; @Albrecht]."
"Relic GWs can affect the CMB, causing magnetic type of CMB polarization;, therefore, it is needed to know what happens to the tensor perturbation between the time of inflation and the $ \Lambda- $ dominated era, assuming that the universe is a perfect fluid [@Lifshitz]."
S. Weinberg derived an integro-differential equation to propagate cosmological gravitation waves in terms of $ y=\dfrac{a}{a_{EQ}} $ ($ EQ $ is the era when matter and radiation density are equal).
"He also investigated the neutrino effects on the GWs in special radiation, dominated in flat spacetime [@damping]."
"According to the Planck report our universe appears to be spatially flat to an accuracy of $ 0.5 \% $, but in no way do the data rule out the case of $ K=1 $[@Planck]."
"Hence in addition to the flat case, by choosing the maximally extended de-Sitter metric ($ K=1 $) as unperturbed background, it has been found that the tensor modes fluctuations (or GWs) are equal in curved spacetime within accelerated universe expansion [@gholizadeh]."
Then the effect of neutrinos on GWs’ background have been taken into consideration as anisotropic inertia tensor [@gholizadeh2].
"Here, similar to the S. Weinberg’s work in radiation dominated, we have applied this formula on matter and $ \Lambda-$ dominated era, where anisotropic inertia tensor is determined by neutrinos and antineutrinos from the temperature  $ \approx 10^{10}K $ when electron positron annihilation is substantially filfilled and neutrinos have decoupled from matter and radiation."
"The current paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses short wavelengths, re-entering the horizon during the matter-dominated phase, for these modes are time-independent when leaving the horizon."
"Section III presents the GW’s equation in vacuum era, discussing the effects of free streaming neutrinos on it."
And in the final section the conclusion is presented along with relevant discussions and comparisons of the results from flat[@Stefanek] as well as closed cosmology in $ \Lambda- $ dominated era.
"General Short Wavelengths
=========================

The tensor fluctuation in curved spacetime satisfies[@gholizadeh] $$\begin{aligned}
\label{4}
\nabla^{2}D_{ij}-a^{2}\ddot{D}_{ij}-3a\dot{a}D_{ij}-2KD_{ij}=16\pi G\Pi_{ij}\end{aligned}$$ Here, the dots stand for derivative respect to the ordinary time, $ K $ is curvature constant, and $ \Pi_{ij} $ is anisotropic inertia tensor, containing the photons and neutrinos, though the former makes an insignificant contribution, due to a short mean free time."
"As shown in Appendix A, the above equation becomes an integro-differential equation $$\begin{aligned}
\label{7}
\ddot{D}_{q}(t)+3\dfrac{\dot{a}}{a}D_{q}(t)+\dfrac{q^{2}}{a^{2}(t)}D_{q}(t)=-64\pi G\bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t)\int_{0}^{t} K(-q \int_{t^{'}}^{t}\frac{dt^{''}}{a(t^{''})})\dot{D}_{q}(t^{'})dt^{'}\end{aligned}$$ for the flat background $ (K=0) $ and for closed spacetime is (see Appendix A) $$\begin{aligned}
\label{88}
\ddot{D}_{n}(t)+3\dfrac{\dot{a}}{a}D_{n}(t)+\dfrac{q^{2}}{a^{2}(t)}D_{n}(t)=-64\pi G\bar{\rho}(\tau)e^{-2i\tau^{2} q^{2}}\dfrac{16}{\pi q} \dfrac{\sin \tau q}{\tau^{3} q^{3}} \int_{0}^{\tau q} d\tau^{\prime}[\dot{D}_{q}(\tau^{\prime})]\dfrac{\sin \tau^{'}q}{\tau^{'}q} e^{2i\tau^{\prime 2} q^{2}}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ At first by neglecting the anisotropic inertia tensor $ \Pi_{ij}^{T} $, the field equation (\[4\]), governing the Fourier components of the tensor components of $ D_{ij} $, becomes $$\label{6}
\ddot{D}_{q}(t)+3\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\dot{D}_{q}(t)+\frac{q^{2}}{a^{2}}D_{q}(t)=0$$ The wave number $ q $ is a continuous number, yet in closed spacetime $q^{2}=n^{2}-2 $ and $ n $ becomes a discrete one."
"To study the treat of $D_{q}(t) $ evolution, it is convenient to change the independent variable $ t $ to $X \equiv \frac{\bar{\rho}_{\Lambda}}{\bar{\rho}_{M}}=\frac{\bar{\rho}_{\Lambda,EQ}}{\bar{\rho}_{M,EQ}}\dfrac{a^{3}}{a_{EQ}^{3}} $, where $ a_{EQ} $,$\bar{\rho}_{\Lambda,EQ} $ and $ \bar{\rho}_{M,EQ} $ are the value of the Robertson-Walker scale factor, the energy density of vacuum, and the energy density of matter at equality of matter-$ \Lambda $ era respectively."
"From the Friedmann equation we will have $$\begin{aligned}
\label{10}
H_{EQ}\dfrac{dt}{\sqrt{2}}=\dfrac{d X}{3\sqrt{X+2\Omega_{K,EQ}X^{4/3}+2X^{2}}}\end{aligned}$$ where $ H_{EQ} $ is the expansion rate and $ \Omega_{K,EQ} $, the curvature energy when matter and $ \Lambda $ densities are equal."
"In particular we can define $ \chi(u) $ as $$\begin{aligned}
D_{ij}(u)=D_{ij}(0)\chi(u)\end{aligned}$$ where $ u $ is the conformal time multiplied by the wave number $ q $ : $$\begin{aligned}
u=q\int\limits_{0}^{t}\dfrac{dt^{'}}{a(t^{'})}\end{aligned}$$ when the universe was still matter-dominated, $ \chi(u) $ satisfied an integro-differential equation for short wavelengths entering the horizon $$\label{3}
u^{2}\chi^{''}(u)+4u\chi^{'}(u)+u^{2}=-24f_{0}(\nu)\int_{0}^{u}dU K(u-U)\chi^{'}(u)$$ where $ f_{\nu}(0)=\frac{\Omega_{\nu}}{\Omega_{\nu}+\Omega_{\gamma}}=0.40523 $ is the fraction of the energy density in neutrinos and $ K(u) $ $$\begin{aligned}
\label{13}
 K(u)&\equiv& \dfrac{1}{16}\int_{-1}^{+1}dy (1-y^{2})^{2}e^{iuy}=-\dfrac{\sin u}{u^{3}}-3\dfrac{\cos u}{u^{4}}+3\dfrac{\sin u}{u^{5}}\nonumber\\ &=& \dfrac{1}{15}(j_{0}(u)+\dfrac{10}{7}j_{2}(u)+\dfrac{3}{7}j_{4}(u))\end{aligned}$$ in which $ j_{n} $ is the spherical Bessel function."
"The initial conditions are $$\begin{aligned}
\label{14}
\chi(0)=1~~~~~,~~~~~\chi^{'}(0)=0\end{aligned}$$ The homogeneous solution of Eq."
(\[3\]) is $ \dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}} $ where $ u=\frac{3qt}{a(t)} $ and $ a(t) $ is the scale factor in matter dominated era.
In the presence of the neutrinos the solution will be suppressed and the solution of the Eq.
"(\[3\]) for $ u\gg 1 $ approaches $$\begin{aligned}
\chi(u)\longrightarrow A \dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}}\end{aligned}$$ A solution can be given for Eq."
"(\[3\]) as the series of the spherical Bessel function: $$\begin{aligned}
\label{30}
\chi(u)=\sum_{n=0} a_{n}\dfrac{j_{n}(u)}{u}\end{aligned}$$ Inserting the Eq."
(\[30\]) in the left-hand side of the Eq.
"(\[3\]), we get $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=2} (n-1)(n+2)a_{n}\dfrac{j_{n}(u)}{u}\end{aligned}$$ Using the $ \dfrac{j_{n}(u)}{u}=\dfrac{1}{2n+1}(j_{n-1}(u)+j_{n+1}(u)) $ the above relation will become $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=1} \{\dfrac{(n-2)(n+1)}{2n-1}a_{n-1}+\dfrac{n(n+3)}{2n+3}a_{n+1}\} j_{n}(u)\end{aligned}$$ Also the derivative of the $ \chi(u) $ is given by $$\begin{aligned}
\chi^{'}(u)=\sum \dfrac{a_{n}}{2n+1} \{ \dfrac{1}{2n-1}[(n-1)j_{n-2}(u)-nj_{n}(u)]+\dfrac{1}{2n+3}[(n+1)j_{n}(u)-(n+2)j_{n+2}(u)]\}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ The right hand side of the Eq."
"(\[3\]) can be written as $ 1.6 f_{0}(\nu) I(u) $ and $I(u)$ given by $$\begin{aligned}
\label{8}
I(u)= \sum_{m=0,2,4}  \dfrac{1}{15} d_{m} \sum_{n=0}\{ \dfrac{a_{n}}{(2n+1)(2n-1)}I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)+\dfrac{a_{n}}{(2n+1)(2n+3)}I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)\}\end{aligned}$$ where $ I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)=\int\limits_{0}^{u} dU j_{m}(u-U)[(n-1)j_{n-2}(U)-nj_{n}(U)] $ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)=\int\limits_{0}^{u} dU j_{m}(u-U)[(n+1)j_{n}(U)-(n+2)nj_{n+2}(U)]$ and $ d_{m} $ are obtained from Eq.(\[13\])."
The contributions to the coefficient of each $j_{l}(u)$ can be evaluated straightforwardly in Appendix B.
"Then by replacing $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{m=0,2,4} \dfrac{1}{15}   \dfrac{d_{m}}{(2n+1)}(\frac{I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)}{2n-1}+\dfrac{I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)}{(2n+3)})\end{aligned}$$ with $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{l,n}C_{n,l}j_{2l}(u)\end{aligned}$$ $C_{n,l}$ become known coefficient numbers, given in Appendix B."
"Eventually, Eq."
"(\[3\]) will be $$\begin{aligned}
 \label{27}
\sum_{n=1} \{\dfrac{(n-2)(n+1)}{2n-1}a_{n-1}+\dfrac{n(n+3)}{2n+3}a_{n+1}\} j_{n}(u)=\sum_{l=0,n=1}C_{n,l}a_{2n-1}j_{2l}(u)\end{aligned}$$ From the conditions (\[14\]) it is known that $a_{0}=a_{2}=0$ and $a_{1}=1$ so that all nonzero $ a_{n}'s $ could be found and with the exception of $a_{1}$, the other coefficients are observed to be quite small: $$\begin{aligned}
a_{1}&=&1~~~,~~~a_{3}=-1.491 \times 10^{-2}~~,~~a_{5}=3.22 \times 10^{-3}~~,~~ \nonumber\\a_{7}&=&-2.88 \times 10^{-3}~~,~~a_{9}=2.44 \times 10^{-3}~~,~~a_{11}=-1.83 \times 10^{-3}\end{aligned}$$ All of the nonzero odd order of Bessel function go as $A$ $$\begin{aligned}
A=\sum_{n=1}^{6}a_{2n-1}=0.98600\end{aligned}$$ So that $\chi(u)$ approaches $0.986 \dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}}$ or $ 0.986 j_{1}(u) $ for nonzero $f_{0}(\nu)$ which is illustrated in Fig.1."
"As it is clear from the Fig.1, in the matter-dominated era, neutrinos have very little impact on gravitational waves when the tensor modes are deep within the horizon, whereas in radiation-dominated era the free propagation of GW’s is $\dfrac{\sin u }{u} $, becoming $ 0.8024 \dfrac{\sin u}{u} $ in presence of neutrinos."
Independent of neutrinos the GWs in matter dominated era as well as after ($ \Lambda -$ dominated) is weaker than the previous (i.e.
radiation) dominated era.
"Here, we consider the background of spacetime to be curved and the tensor modes are deep inside of horizon so the integro-differential equation (\[7\]) becomes $$\begin{aligned}
\label{101}
\dfrac{d^{2}}{d u^{2}}D_{n}(u)+(\dfrac{4}{u})\dfrac{d}{du}D_{n}(u)+D_{n}(u)=\dfrac{35.75 f_{v}(0)}{\pi}\dfrac{\sin u}{u^{5}}\end{aligned}$$

!"
"[In matter dominated era when the perturbation enters the horizon, the free-streaming neutrinos (dashed line) have no significant impact on the gravitational waves and the solution of gravitational waves equation is approximately identical to the $f_{0}(\nu)=0$ (red line), as well as in vacuum dominated era in flat spacetime."
"[]{data-label=""fig:1""}](1)

The general solution of above equation is $$\begin{aligned}
\label{18}
D_{n}(u)=(D_{n}^{0} -\frac{458}{75}Si(2u) + \dfrac{\frac{458}{75}Ci(2u)+\frac{229}{75}-D_{n}^{1}}{u})\dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}}\end{aligned}$$ where $ D_{n}^{0} $ and $ D_{n}^{1} $ are constant."
$ Ci(2u) $ is the Cosine integral as $ Ci(2u) =\gamma +\ln(2u) +\int_{0}^{2u}\dfrac{\cos t -1}{t} dt $ and $Si(2u)$ is the Sine integral as $ Si(2u)= \int_{0}^{2u} \frac{\sin t}{t}$.
"Deep inside the horizon when $ u\gg 1 $, the right hand side of the Eq."
"(\[101\]) can be entirely neglected and the solution approaches a homogeneous one as $$\begin{aligned}
D_{n}(u)\longrightarrow \frac{\sin u}{ u^{2}}\end{aligned}$$ for large $ u ~(u\gg 1)$, $ Ci(2u) $ and $ Si(2u) $ tend to zero and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ respectively."
"So $$\begin{aligned}
D_{n}(u\gg)=(D_{n}^{0}-9.5874)\dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}}+(\frac{4.7937-D_{n}^{1}}{u})\dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}}\end{aligned}$$ In $u\gg 1$, $ D_{n}(u)$ tends to be zero so the constant coefficients are $ D_{n}^{0}=9.5874 $ and $ D_{n}^{1}=4.7937 $ and also a numerical solution of Eq."
(\[101\]) shows that $ D_{n}(u) $ follows the $ f_{v}(0)=0 $ solution quite accurately until $ u \approx 1 $ when the perturbation enters horizon (as compared with the solution $ \dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}} $ for $ f_{v}(0)=0 $).
"Thereafter, the solution (\[18\]) rapidly approaches $ 0.6258 \dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}} $."
"Thus the neutrino effect reduces the tensor amplitude by the factor of $ 0.6258 $ in closed cosmology, while in flat case the factor was $ 0.9860 $ in matter-dominated era."
"Hence the tensor contribution to the temperature multipole coefficient $ C_{l} $ and the whole of the $ ^{''}\verb""B-B""^{''} $ polarization multipole coefficient $ C_{lB}$ will be $ 0.03 \% $ ($ 60 \% $), less than what they would be without damping, as a result of free-streaming neutrinos in flat (closed) spacetime."
"Consequently, in mater-dominated era (same as the radiation-dominated one) and in closed cosmology, the amplitude of the gravitational waves at the presence of neutrinos will be less than the flat case or the neutrinos will have a greater effect on the damping of gravitational waves in closed cosmology as shown in Fig.2."
Also the neutrinos reduce the amplitude to same extent as the radiation dominated era.
!
"[In matter dominated era when the perturbation enters the horizon, the free-streaming neutrinos in closed cosmology (blue line) have a greater effect than the flat case (dashes) on the damping of gravitational waves and almost the same amount of amplitude reduction in radiation dominated era."
"[]{data-label=""fig:2""}](2)

 Wavelengths at $\Lambda-$ dominated era
========================================

To investigate the tensor perturbation may enter horizon after the $\Lambda$ density becomes important, we consider $ X\gg 1 $ so from (\[10\]) we have $$\begin{aligned}
H_{EQ}\dfrac{dt}{\sqrt{2}}=\dfrac{dX}{3\sqrt{X^{2}+2\Omega_{K,EQ}X^{4/3}}}\end{aligned}$$ where $ \Omega_{K,EQ} $ is curvature density when the matter and vacuum density are equal."
"So then the equation (\[6\]) becomes $$\begin{aligned}
\label{110}
(X^{2}+2\Omega_{K,EQ}X^{4/3})\dfrac{d^{2}}{dX^{2}}D_{n}(X)+(4X+\dfrac{22}{3}\Omega_{K,EQ}X^{1/3})\dfrac{d}{dX}D_{n}(X)+\dfrac{\kappa^{2}}{X^{2/3}}D_{n}(X)=0\end{aligned}$$ where $ \kappa^{2}=\dfrac{2n^{2}}{9 H_{EQ}^{2}a_{EQ}^{2}} $ and $ n $ are discrete numbers for curved spacetime ."
"Whatever the value of $ \kappa $ , the general solution is $$\begin{aligned}
D_{n}(X)=\dfrac{1}{X^{4/3}} \{C_{n}^{0} Legendre P(4,\sqrt{\dfrac{32\Omega_{K,EQ}-9\kappa^{2}}{2\Omega_{K,EQ}}},\sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa^{2/3}
+2\Omega_{K,EQ}}{2\Omega_{K,EQ}}})+ \nonumber\\ C_{n}^{1}LegendreQ(4,\sqrt{\dfrac{32\Omega_{K,EQ}-9\kappa^{2}}{2\Omega_{K,EQ}}},\sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa^{2/3}
+2\Omega_{K,EQ}}{2\Omega_{K,EQ}}})\}\end{aligned}$$ where $ C_{n}^{1} $ and $ C_{n}^{0} $ are constant."
It can be seen from the above relation that the propagation of GWs today ($ \Lambda- $ dominated) can depend on the curvature energy when the matter and vacuum energy are equal.
"If we consider $ \Omega_{K,EQ}\ll 1 $, we can ignore it from the Eq."
"(\[110\]) and then $$\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{d^{2}}{dX^{2}}D_{n}(X)+\dfrac{4}{X}\dfrac{d}{dX}D_{n}(X)+\dfrac{\kappa^{2}}{X^{8/3}}D_{n}(X)=0\end{aligned}$$ The solution of which is $$\begin{aligned}
D_{n}(X)=[ (-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{1/3}})^{4}-5(-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{1/3}})^{2}+\dfrac{35}{27}] (C_{n}^{0} \cosh (3\sqrt{-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{2/3}}})+ C_{n}^{1}\sinh(3\sqrt{-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{2/3}}})) \nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ The solution does not oscillate when $k\ll 1$ and in $ X\longrightarrow \infty $ separately."
"Then we can consider the condition $ \dfrac{\kappa}{X} \longrightarrow 0 $ tend to remain a constant value; therefore, the neutrinos have no influence on the gravitational waves."
"Also similar to the previous work [@damping; @gholizadeh2], all wavelengths take the damping value, multiplied by the neutrino, from matter-dominated era when they enter the horizon in the $\Lambda-$ dominated era as a $$\begin{aligned}
D_{n}(X)=\alpha (k)[ (-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{1/3}})^{4}-5(-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{1/3}})^{2}+\dfrac{35}{27}] (C_{n}^{0} \cosh (3\sqrt{-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{2/3}}})+ C_{n}^{1}\sinh(3\sqrt{-\dfrac{\kappa}{X^{2/3}}}))\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ where $\alpha (k)$ is $ 0.9860$ for $ k\gg 1$ and $\alpha (k)=1$ for $k\ll 1$ because the damping effect is equal to zero for $k\ll 1$."
Therefore it could be said $\alpha (k)\cong \dfrac{1+0.986 k}{1+k }$ and the amplitude of gravitational waves will be reduced by the factor $\alpha (k)$.
"The Closed Background Effective
===============================

It is known that the $ \Omega_{K} $ is very small and, compared to $ \Omega_{\Lambda} $ and $ \Omega_{M} $, is negligible."
"It is not possible to consider the cases $ K=0 $ and $ K=1 $ at once, hence by taking the limit $ \Omega_{K}\longrightarrow 0 $ reach to the flat spacetimes."
"Here we are facing two different topologies that lead to two different structures, thus it has been shown that with the choice of the curved background, the relativistic Boltzman equation for the perturbation $ \delta n(\vec{x}, \vec{p},t) $ will change ( \[2\] ) and also the equation of the angular distribution cosmic neutrino will alter as $$\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)+\dfrac{iq\mu}{a(t)}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)-4 K\dfrac{q}{a(t)}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \mu}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)=-2 \dot{D}_{q}(t)~~~\end{aligned}$$ so the neutrino contribution of the anisotropic inertia tensor $ \Pi_{ij}^{T} $ will differ from the flat background."
At the end the integro-differential equation of the gravitational wave at the presence of neutrinos changes (eq.\[88\]).
"Another important point is that the wave number in the closed background is discrete, which reduces the modes."
"Although the $ \Omega_{K} $ has no effect but as can be seen the topology is equally effective in the amplitude of the GWs at the presence of neutrinos in radiation and matter dominated eras

CONCLUSION
==========

We derive the propagation of gravitational waves, based on the equality parameter of matter and vacuum energy."
"We have seen that in the matter dominated era, the homogeneous solution of gravitational waves equation is $ \dfrac{\sin u}{u^{2}} $ whereas in earlier ( radiation dominated era) it is $\dfrac{\sin u}{u} $, so that the GWs are weaker as $ \dfrac{1}{u}$ while $ u\approx \dfrac{qt}{a(t)} $."
"During the matter and $\Lambda-$ dominated, the effect of the neutrinos is weak even weaker than the previous era."
Also the neutrino effects in radiation dominated and flat background are weaker than the closed case as the amplitude of the GWs in flat background is $0.8026$ [@damping; @Dicus] and for closed it is $0.4910$ [@gholizadeh2].
"Furthermore, it has been shown that the amplitude of GWs at the presence of neutrinos in matter dominated for flat background is $0.9860$ and for closed, $0.6258$ ."
"So then the neutrino contribution of the anisotropic inertia tensor $ \Pi_{ij}^{T} $ in closed background has approximately the same effect on the amplitude of GWs in radiation and matter era in flat spacetime, which is less at $ \Lambda- $ dominated era."
"Appendix A: Damping Effects on Wave Equation {#appendix-a-damping-effects-on-wave-equation .unnumbered}
============================================

We review the relativistic equation for perturbation of number density of neutrinos $ \delta n(\vec{x},\vec{p}, t)$ in closed spacetime."
"In general the tensor mode gravitational perturbation takes the form $$\begin{aligned}
\delta g_{ij}=h_{ij}(\vec{x},t)=a^{2}(t) D_{ij}(\vec{x},t)\end{aligned}$$ Where the tensor fluctuation in curved spacetime satisfies [@gholizadeh] $$\begin{aligned}
\nabla^{2}D_{ij}-a^{2}\ddot{D}_{ij}-3a\dot{a}D_{ij}-2KD_{ij}=16\pi G\Pi_{ij}\end{aligned}$$ In which $ K $ is curvature constant and $ \Pi_{ij} $, anisotropic inertia tensor."
"The components of the perturbed metric in Cartesian coordinate are [@weinberg] $$\begin{aligned}
g_{00}=-1~,~g_{i0}=0~,~g_{ij}=a^2(t)(\delta_{ij}+K\frac{x^ix^j}{1-Kx^2}+D_{ij}(\vec{x},t))\end{aligned}$$ tensor perturbation and anisotropic inertia satisfy $$\begin{aligned}
D_{ii}=0~~~,~~~ \nabla^{i}D_{ij}=0~~~,~~~\Pi_{ii}=0~~~,~~~\nabla^{i}\Pi_{ij}=0\end{aligned}$$ The anisotropic inertia tensor is the sum of contributions from photons and neutrinos, though the former have an insignificant contribution to the anisotropic inertia due to a short mean free time."
"The latter travels without collisions when temperature drops about $ T=10^{10} K $ so neutrino distribution function in phase space has a form $$n_{\nu}(\vec{x},\hat{p},t)\equiv \sum_{r}\prod_{i=1}^{3}\delta^{(3)}(x^{i}-x_{r}^{i}(t))\prod_{i=1}^{3}\delta^{(3)}(p_{i}-p_{ri}(t))$$ Where $ r $ is individual neutrinos and anti neutrinos trajectories."
"In the absence of collisions terms, Boltzmann equation for neutrinos will be $$\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{\partial n_{\nu}}{\partial t}+\dfrac{\partial n_{\nu}}{\partial x^{i}}\dot{x}^{i}+\dfrac{\partial n_{\nu}}{\partial p^{i}}p_{i}^{0}=0\end{aligned}$$ so that $ \dot{p}_{ri}=\dfrac{1}{2p_{r}^{0}}p_{r}^{j}p_{r}^{k}(\dfrac{\partial g_{jk}}{\partial x^{i}})_{x=x_{r}} $ and $ \dot{x}_{r}^{i}=\dfrac{p_{r}^{i}}{p_{r}^{0}} $ are the change rate of momentum and the change rate of the coordinate respectively, so the above relation will be $$\begin{aligned}
\label{1}
\dfrac{\partial n_{\nu}}{\partial t}+\dfrac{\partial n_{\nu}}{\partial x^{i}}\dfrac{p^{i}}{p^{0}}+\dfrac{\partial n_{\nu}}{\partial p^{i}}\dfrac{p^{j}p^{k}}{2p^{0}}\dfrac{\partial g_{jk}}{\partial x^{i}}=0\end{aligned}$$ $ n_{\nu}(\vec{x},t) $ in the start of free streaming has the form of the ideal gas: $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{n}_{\nu}(\vec{x},t)=\dfrac{N_{\nu}}{(2\pi)^{3}}/[exp(\dfrac{\sqrt{g^{ij}p_{i}p_{j}}}{k_{B}a(t)\bar{T}(t)})+1]\end{aligned}$$ $ N_{\nu} $ is the number of neutrino types and separate antineutrinos."
Moreover $ k_{B} $ is the Boltzmann constant.
"With a small perturbation to the metric, the neutrino distribution function gets varies a little from its equilibrium form as $$\begin{aligned}
n_{\nu}(\vec{x},t)=n_{\nu}(a(t)\sqrt{g^{ij}p_{i}p_{j}})+\delta n_{\nu}(\vec{x},t)\end{aligned}$$ Where $ p^{i} $ , $ p $ and $ p^{0} $ are functions of independent variable $ p_{i} $ by $p^{i}=g^{ij}p_{j}=a^{-2}(p_{i}-Kx^{i}x^{j}p_{j}) $ and $p=\sqrt{\tilde{g}^{ij} p_{i} p_{j}}=\sqrt{(\delta^{ij}-Kx^{i}x^{j})p_{i}p_{j}}$ and $ p^{0}=\sqrt{g^{ij}p_{i}p_{j}} $."
"Initially we assume the background spacetime to be flat, thus the first order of metric and density perturbation Eq."
"(\[1\]) will be $$\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{\partial\delta n_{\nu}}{\partial t}+\dfrac{p^{i}}{a(t)p}\dfrac{\partial\delta n_{\nu}}{\partial x^{i}}=\dfrac{p}{2}\hat{p}_{i}\hat{p}_{j}\bar{n}_{\nu}^{\prime}(p)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}(a^{-2}\delta g^{ij})\end{aligned}$$ with $ \delta g_{ij}=a^{2}D_{ij}(\vec{x},t) $, and the relativistic Boltzmann equation for the perturbation $ \delta n_{\nu}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t) $ will be $$\begin{aligned}
\label{02}
\dfrac{\partial\delta n_{\nu}}{\partial t}+\dfrac{p^{i}}{a(t)p}\dfrac{\partial\delta n_{\nu}}{\partial x^{i}}=\dfrac{p}{2}\hat{p}_{i}\hat{p}_{j}\bar{n}_{\nu}^{\prime}(p)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}D^{ij}(\vec{x},t)\end{aligned}$$ We use a dimensionless intensity perturbation $ J $, defined by $$\begin{aligned}
a^{4}(t) \bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t) J(\vec{x},\vec{p},t)\equiv N_{\nu}\int_{0}^{\infty}\delta n_{\nu}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t) 4\pi p^{3}dp\end{aligned}$$ and $ \bar{\rho}_{\nu} \equiv N_{\nu} a^{-4}\int 4\pi \rho^{3}\bar{n}_{\nu}(p)dp$."
"The Boltzmann equation (\[02\]) becomes $$\begin{aligned}
\label{15}
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}J(\vec{x},\hat{p},t)+\dfrac{\hat{p}_{i}}{a(t)}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}J(\vec{x},\hat{p},t)=-2 \hat{p}_{i}\hat{p}_{j}\dot{D}_{ij}(\vec{x},t)\end{aligned}$$ we will be able to find a general solution in the following form: $$\begin{aligned}
J(\vec{x},\hat{p},t)=\sum_{\lambda=\pm 2}\int dq e^{i\vec{q}.\vec{x}}e_{ij}(\hat{q},\lambda)\beta(\hat{q},\lambda)\hat{p}_{i}\hat{p}_{j}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\hat{p}.\hat{q},t)\end{aligned}$$ where $ \beta(\vec{q},t) $ is a stochastic parameter for the single non-decaying mode with the wave number $ q $ and the helicity $ \lambda $, $ e_{ij}(\hat{q},t) $ is the corresponding polarization tensor, and $\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\hat{p}.\hat{q},t)$ is the angular distribution of cosmic neutrinos."
"We can define $ D_{ij}(\vec{x},t) $ as $$\begin{aligned}
D_{ij}(\vec{x},t) =\int dq \int d^{2}\hat{q}\sum_{\lambda=\pm 2}e_{ij}(\hat{q},\lambda)\beta(\hat{q},\lambda)D_{q}(t)\end{aligned}$$ With $ \hat{p}_{i}\hat{q}_{i}=\mu $ Eq."
"(\[15\]) resulting in an equation for $ \Delta_{\nu}^{(T)} $: $$\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)+\dfrac{iq\mu}{a(t)}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)=-2 \dot{D}_{q}(t)\end{aligned}$$ A direct solution of above equation as a line of sight integral $$\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)=-2 \int_{t_{1}}^{t} d t^{'}\exp (-iq\mu \int_{t^{'}}^{t}\frac{dt^{''}}{a(t^{''})})\dot{D}_{q}(t^{'})\end{aligned}$$ $\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t_{1})$ is the initial value once the neutrinos are decoupled at $T=10^{10} K$ which will not be taken into consideration as the distribution of the neutrinos is essentially local thermal equilibrium and only the neutrino temperature,$\delta T_{\nu}$ and the streaming velocity,$\delta \vec{u}_{\nu}$ can perturb this distribution."
"What is more, these parameters do not have tensor components, thus they can be easily ignored."
"In the tensor mode, the only non-vanishing component is $ \delta T^{i}_{~\nu j} $: $$\begin{aligned}
\delta T^{i}_{~\nu j}(\vec{x},t)&=&a^{-4}(t) \int d^{3}p ~\delta n_{\nu}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t)p \hat{p}_{i}\hat{p}_{j}\nonumber\\ &=&\bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t)\sum_{\lambda}  \int d^{3}q \beta (\vec{q},\lambda) e^{i\vec{q}.\vec{x}}e_{ij}(\hat{q},\lambda)\times \frac{1}{4}\int\frac{d^{2}\hat{p}}{4\pi}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\hat{p}.\hat{q},t)(1-(\hat{p}.\hat{q})^{2})^{2}\nonumber\\ &=&\sum_{\lambda}  \int d^{3}q \beta (\vec{q},\lambda) e^{i\vec{q}.\vec{x}}e_{ij}(\hat{q},\lambda) \pi_{\nu~q}^{T}(t)\end{aligned}$$ This is the neutrino contribution of the anisotropic inertia tensor $ \Pi^{T}_{ij} $: $$\begin{aligned}
\pi_{\nu~q}^{T}(t)&=&-4\bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t)\int\frac{d^{2}\hat{p}}{4\pi}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\hat{p}.\hat{q},t)(1-(\hat{p}.\hat{q})^{2})^{2}
\nonumber\\&=&-4\bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t)  \int_{t_{1}}^{t} d t^{'}K(q\int_{}^{}\frac{dt^{''}}{a(t^{''})})\dot{D}_{q}(t)\end{aligned}$$ Where $$\begin{aligned}
K(v)=\frac{j_{2}(v)}{v}=-\frac{\sin v}{v^{3}}-\frac{3\cos v}{v^{4}}+\frac{3\sin v}{v^{5}}\end{aligned}$$ so the gravitational wave equation now becomes an integro-differential equation: $$\begin{aligned}
\label{7}
\ddot{D}_{q}(t)+3\dfrac{\dot{a}}{a}D_{q}(t)+\dfrac{q^{2}}{a^{2}(t)}D_{q}(t)=-64\pi G\bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t)\int_{0}^{t} K(-q \int_{t^{'}}^{t}\frac{dt^{''}}{a(t^{''})})\dot{D}_{q}(t^{'})dt^{'}\end{aligned}$$ Assuming the background is curved, with $ \delta g_{ij}=a^{2}D_{ij}(\vec{x},t) $, the relativistic Boltzmann equation for the perturbation $ \delta n_{\nu}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t) $ will be [@gholizadeh2] $$\begin{aligned}
\label{2}
\dfrac{\partial\delta n_{\nu}}{\partial t}+\dfrac{p^{i}}{a(t)p}\dfrac{\partial\delta n_{\nu}}{\partial x^{i}}+K \dfrac{\hat{p}_{i}}{a(t)}p x^{l}\hat{p}_{l}\dfrac{\partial\delta n_{\nu}}{\partial p_{i}}=\dfrac{p}{2}\hat{p}_{i}\hat{p}_{j}\bar{n}_{\nu}^{\prime}(p)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}D^{ij}(\vec{x},t) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nonumber\\

\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)+\dfrac{iq\mu}{a(t)}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)-4 K\dfrac{q}{a(t)}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \mu}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\mu,t)=-2 \dot{D}_{q}(t)~~~~~~~~~~~~\end{aligned}$$ With the Green function method the solution is $$\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{\nu}(q,\mu,\tau)= \dfrac{i}{2 \pi }e^{-i\tau q(\mu+ 2 \tau q)}\int _{-1}^{+1}d\mu^{\prime} \int_{0}^{\pi} d\tau^{\prime}[-2\dot{D}_{q}(\tau^{\prime})] \Theta(\tau^{\prime}q-2\tau q) e^{i\tau^{\prime} q(\mu^{\prime}+ 2\tau^{\prime}q)}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ The neutrino contribution of the anisotropic inertia tensor $ \Pi^{T}_{ij} $ is: $$\begin{aligned}
\Pi^{T}_{ij}&=&\frac{\bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t)}{4}\int\frac{d^{2}\hat{p}}{4\pi}\Delta_{\nu}^{T}(q,\hat{p}.\hat{q},t)(1-(\hat{p}.\hat{q})^{2})^{2}\nonumber\\&=&-\dfrac{\bar{\rho}_{\nu}(t)}{4}(\dfrac{1}{2\pi })e^{-2i\tau^{2} q^{2}} \dfrac{1}{\tau^{5} q^{5}}[(-16\tau^{2} q^{2}+48)\sin(\tau q)-48\tau q \cos(\tau q)] \nonumber\\&\times & \int _{-1}^{+1}d\mu^{\prime} \int_{0}^{\tau q} d\tau^{\prime}[-2\dot{D}_{q}(\tau^{\prime})] e^{i\tau^{\prime} q(\mu^{\prime}+ 2\tau^{\prime}q)}\end{aligned}$$ Finally, the integro-differential equation of gravitational waves in the presence of inertia tensor of neutrinos becomes $$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{D}_{n}(t)+3\dfrac{\dot{a}}{a}D_{n}(t)+\dfrac{q^{2}}{a^{2}(t)}D_{n}(t)=-64\pi G\bar{\rho}(\tau)e^{-2i\tau^{2} q^{2}}\dfrac{16}{\pi q} \dfrac{\sin \tau q}{\tau^{3} q^{3}} \int_{0}^{\tau q} d\tau^{\prime}[\dot{D}_{q}(\tau^{\prime})]\dfrac{\sin \tau^{'}q}{\tau^{'}q} e^{2i\tau^{\prime 2} q^{2}}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ The next section will calculate the decay of gravitational waves in the matter dominated era for flat and closed spacetimes."

The right hand side of the Eq."
"(\[3\]) is $-CI(u)$ with $C=1.6 f_{\nu}(0)=0.648368$ and $I(u)$ given by $$\begin{aligned}
\label{8}
I(u)= \sum_{n=0} a_{n}\sum_{m=0,2,4}  \dfrac{1}{15} \frac{d_{m}}{(2n+1)} \{ \dfrac{I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)}{(2n-1)}+\dfrac{I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)}{(2n+3)}\}\end{aligned}$$ Where $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)$ are $$\begin{aligned}
\label{56}
I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)&=&\int\limits_{0}^{u} dU j_{m}(u-U)[(n-1)j_{n-2}(U)-nj_{n}(U) ]\nonumber\\
I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)&=&\int\limits_{0}^{u} dU j_{m}(u-U)[(n+1)j_{n}(U)-(n+2)nj_{n+2}(U)]\end{aligned}$$ In order to evaluate the $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)$, the Abramowitz and Stegun handbook have been used [@abra]."
"Initially, by using the Fourier, the transformation of a Legendre polynomial becomes a spherical Bessel function $(AS.10.1.14)$ $$\begin{aligned}
\label{57}
j_{n}(u)=\frac{(-i)^{n}}{2}\int_{-1}^{+1}ds ~ e^{ius}P_{n}(s)\end{aligned}$$ Putting Eq."
(\[57\]) in Eq.
"(\[56\]) results in $$\begin{aligned}
\label{31}
I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)=\frac{(-i)^{m+n-1}}{4}\int_{-1}^{+1}ds \int_{-1}^{+1}dt \frac{e^{itu}-e^{isu}}{t-s}P_{m}(s)[(n-1)P_{n-2}(t)+nP_{n}(t)]\end{aligned}$$ As well as for $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ we have $$\begin{aligned}
\label{32}
I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)=\frac{(-i)^{m+n+1}}{4}\int_{-1}^{+1}ds \int_{-1}^{+1}dt \frac{e^{itu}-e^{isu}}{t-s}P_{m}(s)[(n+1)P_{n}(t)+(n+2)P_{n+2}(t)]\end{aligned}$$ Defining the Legendre function of the second kin, $(AS.8.83)$ $$\begin{aligned}
Q_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^{+1}dx\frac{1}{z-x}P_{n}(x)\end{aligned}$$ In Eq (\[31\]) and Eq."
"(\[32\]), the exponent s in the first term and t in the second do not appear, hence we have $$\begin{aligned}
I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)&=&\frac{(-i)^{m+n-1}}{4} \int_{-1}^{+1} dt ~e^{itu} \{ Q_{m(t)}[(n-1)P_{n-2}(t)+n P_{n}(t)]+ P_{m}(t)[(n-1)Q_{n-2}(t)+n Q_{n}(t) ] \} \nonumber\\
I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)&=&\frac{(-i)^{m+n+1}}{4}\int_{-1}^{+1} dt ~e^{itu} \{ Q_{m(t)}[(n+1)P_{n}(t)+(n+2) P_{n+2}(t)]\nonumber\\ &  &~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+P_{m}(t)[(n+1)Q_{n}(t)+(n+2) Q_{n+2}(t) ] \}\end{aligned}$$ By replacing $e^{itu}=\sum_{l} (2l+1) i^{l} j_{l}(u)P_{l}(u)$, the expressions for $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)$ become $$\begin{aligned}
I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)=\sum_{l}(-i)^{m+n-l-1}\dfrac{(2l+1)}{2}\{\int_{-1}^{+1}dt P_{l}(t)Q_{m}(t)[(n-1)P_{n-2}(t)+nP_{n}(t)]\nonumber\\+\int_{-1}^{+1}dt P_{l}(t)P_{m}(t)[(n-1)Q_{n-2}(t)+nQ_{n}(t)]\}\end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned}
I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)=\sum_{l}(-i)^{m+n-l+1}\dfrac{(2l+1)}{2}\{\int_{-1}^{+1}dt P_{l}(t)Q_{m}(t)[(n+1)P_{n}(t)+(n+2)P_{n+2}(t)]\nonumber\\+\int_{-1}^{+1}dt P_{l}(t)P_{m}(t)[(n+1)Q_{n}(t)+(n+2)Q_{n+2}(t)]\}\end{aligned}$$ To simplify the above-mentioned relations we use (AS 86.19): $Q_{m}(x)=\frac{1}{2}P_{m}(x)\ln \frac{1+x}{1-x}-W_{m-1}(x)$ where $W_{m-1}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\frac{m-1}{2}}\frac{2m-4k-1}{(2k+1)(m-k)}P_{m-2k-1}(x)$ and the formula $P_{l}(x)P_{m}(x)=\sum_{L=|l-m|}^{l+m}|<l,0,m,0 |L,0>|^{2}P_{L}(x)$."
"Also by using $P_{l}(x) Q_{m}(x)$ in term of $Q_{L}(x)$’s as $P_{l}(x) Q_{m}(x)=\sum_{L=|l-m|}^{l+m}[|<l,0,m,0 |L,0>|^{2}(Q_{L}(x)+W_{L-1}(x))]-P_{l}(x)W_{m-1}(x)$."
"In $I_{nm}(u) $ ’s , the products of $P_{n}(x)'s $ and $Q_{m}(x)'s$ cancel (AS 8.14.10): $$\begin{aligned}
\int_{-1}^{+1}dx( Q_{L}(x)P_{m\pm1}(x)+P_{L}(x)Q_{m\pm1}(x))=0\end{aligned}$$ Finally the $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)$ reduce to $$\begin{aligned}
\label{67}
I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)&=&\sum_{l}(-i)^{m+n-l-1}\frac{2l+1}{2}j_{l}(u)\{\int_{-1}^{+1}dt \sum_{L=|l-m|}^{l+m}|<l,0,m,0 |L,0>|^{2}\nonumber\\ && \times W_{L-1}(t)[(n-1)P_{n-2}(t)+nP_{n}(t)]-\int_{-1}^{+1}dt P_{l}(t)W_{m-1}(t)[(n-1)P_{n-2}(t)+nP_{n}(t)]\}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned}
\label{68}

"The sum over $l$ in $I_{nm}(u)'s$ is the sum of the contributions from the three terms in the kernel $m=0,2,4$."
"For example for $m=0$ the $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)$ will be $$\begin{aligned}
I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)=\sum_{l}(-i)^{n-l-1}\frac{2l+1}{2}|<l,0,0,0 |L,0>|^{2}j_{l}(u)\{ \frac{4(n-1)}{(l-n+2)(l+n-1)}+\frac{4n}{(l-n)(l+n+1)}\}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned}
I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)=\sum_{l}(-i)^{n-l+1}\frac{2l+1}{2}|<l,0,0,0 |L,0>|^{2}j_{l}(u)\{ \frac{4(n+1)}{(l-n)(l+n+1)}+\frac{4(n+2)}{(l-n-2)(l+n+3)}\}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ For $m=2,4$ the expressions are very big and complicated."
Therefore by using the numerical methods we determine the nonzero coefficients.
"The Eq(\[3\]) will be $$\begin{aligned}
 \label{27}
\sum_{n=1} \{\dfrac{(n-2)(n+1)}{2n-1}a_{n-1}+\dfrac{n(n+3)}{2n+3}a_{2n-1}\} j_{n}(u)=-C\sum_{l=0,n=1}C_{n,l}a_{2n+1}j_{2l}(u)\end{aligned}$$ So that it can be written $ C_{n,l} $ based on the $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)$."
"Consequently from the above equation, (\[67\]) and (\[68\]) we have $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{10}{7}a_{3}&=&d_{0}\frac{a_{1}}{3}\frac{I_{10}^{(2)}(u)}{5}+ d_{2}[\frac{a_{1}}{3}(I_{12}^{(1)}(u)+\frac{I_{12}^{(2)}(u)}{5})+\frac{a_{3}}{7}\frac{I_{32}^{(1)}(u)}{5}]\nonumber\\ &&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+d_{4}

\frac{10}{7}a_{3}+\frac{28}{11}a_{5}&=&d_{0}\frac{a_{1}}{3}\frac{I_{10}^{(2)}(u)}{5}+ d_{2}[\frac{a_{1}}{3}(I_{12}^{(1)}(u)+\frac{I_{12}^{(2)}(u)}{5})+\frac{a_{3}}{7}\frac{I_{32}^{(1)}(u)}{5}]\nonumber\\ &&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+d_{4}
[\frac{a_{1}}{3}(I_{14}^{(1)}(u)+\frac{I_{14}^{(2)}(u)}{5})+\frac{a_{3}}{7}\frac{I_{34}^{(1)}(u)}{5}]\nonumber\\
\frac{28}{11}a_{5}+\frac{54}{15}a_{7}&=&d_{0}\frac{a_{1}}{3}\frac{I_{10}^{(2)}(u)}{5}+ d_{2}[\frac{a_{3}}{7}\frac{I_{32}^{(1)}(u)}{5}+\frac{a_{1}}{3}\frac{I_{12}^{(2)}(u)}{5})]+d_{4}

\frac{88}{19}a_{9}+\frac{130}{23}a_{11}&=&d_{0}\frac{a_{1}}{3}\frac{I_{10}^{(2)}(u)}{5}\nonumber\\\end{aligned}$$ And other $I_{nm}^{(1)}(u)$ and $I_{nm}^{(2)}(u)$ are equal to zero."
"With $a_{1}=1$ and $a_{0}= a_{2}=0 $, n even all vanish and we find the $a_{2n-1}$’s decrease easily: $$\begin{aligned}
a_{1}=1~~~~~,~~~~~a_{3}=-1.4\times 10^{-2}~~~~~,~~~~~a_{5}=3.22\times 10^{-3}~~~~~,~~~~~ \nonumber\\
a_{7}=-2.88\times 10^{-3}~~~~~,~~~~~a_{9}=2.44\times 10^{-3}~~~~~,~~~~~a_{11}=-1.88\times 10^{-3}\end{aligned}$$ Therefore all of the nonzero odd order Bessel function go as $A$ $$\begin{aligned}
A=\sum_{n=1}^{6}a_{2n-1}=0.98600\end{aligned}$$

"Yesterday, Minor League Baseball issued a press release summarizing attendance figures for 2016."
"A total of 41,377,202 fans passed through the gates at Minor League Baseball games in 2016, marking the 12th consecutive year the organization drew over 41 million fans."
The 2016 season saw eight teams set single-season franchise attendance records and seven set franchise records for largest single-game attendance.
The 176 Minor League Baseball clubs across 15 leagues combined to record the ninth largest attendance total in Minor League Baseball history.
"""In cities large and small, our teams continue to offer their communities the very best in affordable, family-friendly entertainment in a clean and safe environment,"" said Minor League Baseball President & CEO Pat O’Conner."
"""Minor League Baseball continues to offer what I believe is the best entertainment value in sports, and we are very appreciative of the tremendous fan support received again this year."""
"The Triple-A Indianapolis Indians led all teams in total attendance, as 636,888 fans visited Victory Field this season."
"The Triple-A Charlotte Knights recorded the largest average attendance at 8,974, edging Indianapolis by four fans per game."
"The Columbia Fireflies drew over 260,000 fans in the inaugural season at Spirit Communications Park, the only new ballpark to open in Minor League Baseball in 2016."
"Since 2000, Minor League Baseball clubs have opened 62 new ballparks, with new, or significantly renovated, stadiums scheduled to open in Hartford, Kinston, Lakeland and Tampa for the 2017 season."
"The attendance leaders in each classification of Minor League Baseball and their overall numbers were: Triple-A — Indianapolis Indians (636,888), Double-A — Frisco RoughRiders (463,564), Class A — Dayton Dragons (548,574), Short Season-A and Rookie — Vancouver Canadians (222,363)."
A fact of life is that severe weather and civil disasters occur.
"While precautions are taken to avoid disasters, combinations of circumstances sometimes overcome such precautions We are yet virtually powerless to control the weather."
"Because we are often incapable of preventing disasters and have no means for nullifying or moving weather disturbances, our survival instincts lead us to devise methods for minimizing the toll of human lives and injuries that can result from severe weather and disasters."
"Thus, the weather is carefully monitored and forecast and warnings are issued when threatening weather patterns occur to allow persons in affected areas to take precautions."
"Similarly, fire and police departments and the military services are charged with the responsibilities, often overlapping, of dealing with and minimizing the loss of life and injuries resulting from fires, explosions, chemical leaks and spills, civil disturbances, air raids, and the like."
Several warning methods currently exist for alerting populations to tornadoes and other severe weather and emergencies.
"Television stations often superimpose an indicia indicating a thunderstorm watch and, if very severe weather is impending, interrupt normal programming to notify viewers of a tornado or severe storm warning."
"Deficiencies of this warning method are that a television set must be turned on, actively watched, and tuned to a local station to receive the warning."
"Many communities have a system of remotely controlled, diesel powered sirens, commonly referred to as civil defense or air raid sirens, to warn residents of emergencies."
Such sirens are susceptible to mechanical breakdowns and must be taken out of service periodically for maintenance.
At times local police and fire departments patrol the streets of neighborhoods with their sirens activated and periodically announcing emergencies over loudspeakers.
"This warning method may be ineffective because of inability to hear the sirens or announcements because of storm noise, distance from the siren, interfering noise levels within a residence, location of persons within a residence, or persons asleep in a residence."
"Siren type warning systems do not indicate the specific location of the impending emergency and often do not provide an ""all clear""."
"Because response to emergencies is usually disruptive of normal activities, false warnings or warnings which do not apply to particular individuals cause such persons to tend to ignore sirens and other relatively general types of warnings."
"In a warning system currently in use by the National Weather Service, continuing weather bulletins are broadcast on a VHF frequency."
"Whenever severe weather threatens, an alert is broadcast which triggers an audible alarm in special receivers, such as the Weatheradio units available from Tandy Corporation."
"However, since the coverage areas of the broadcast stations usually encompass a number of county sized areas, it is possible to receive an alert on a receiver in an area to which the alert has no actual significance."
"At best, this amounts to a nuisance."
"Additionally, when an alert is triggered in such a receiver, it must be muted manually by the user since the system does not incorporate a broadcast ""all clear"" signal."
"What is needed is a system of alerting populations to emergency conditions which is geographically specific, which is also specific as to the type of emergency condition, and which cannot be easily ignored or defeated by the persons for whom the warning is directed."

Bcl-2 accelerates the neuronal differentiation: new evidence approaching to the biofunction of bcl-2 in the neuronal system.
The proto-oncogene product Bcl-2 is unique in that it inhibits apoptosis rather than promoting cell proliferation.
"In the present study, we encountered a new possible role of Bcl-2 in the neuronal differentiation."
Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells have been known as the model of neuronal differentiation by the stimulation of NGF.
"Bcl-2 transfected PC12 (MB2) cells showed the accelerated neuronal differentiation, as compared with control PC12 (V4) cells."
"In addition, chemotherapeutic agents Taxol which has been known as neurotoxic compound, induced the acute neuronal cell atrophy and suppressed neuronal differentiation."
This neuronal cell atrophy and suppression of neuronal differentiation were not due to apoptotic cell death.
"Interestingly, Bcl-2 rescued PC12 cells from both neuronal cell atrophy and suppression of neuronal differentiation."
"Taxol suppressed polymerization between neurofilament light and heavy (NF-L and NF-H), and MB2 cell extract rescued it."
"We, therefore, suggest the acceleration of polymerization between NF-L and NF-H as the new possible role of Bcl-2."

I once heard a story about Pia Zadora’s performance as the lead in “The Diary of Anne Frank.” The audience was eager for Zadora's dreadful acting to conclude.
"In a closing scene, Nazis broke into the house, shouting “Where is Anne Frank?” The audience shouted back, “She’s in the attic!” just to try to end the play."
The story is likely apocryphal but it illustrates that not all live performances are really better than the original books.
I had the same impulse watching more than six hours of former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerCNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump CNN anchor rips Trump over Stone while evoking Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting The Hill's 12:30 Report: New Hampshire fallout MORE offering monosyllabic responses as Democrats read his report to him.
Democrats said this would be the “blockbuster movie” for those who “did not read the book” of the report.
"If so, it was the congressional version of the John Travolta movie bomb “Battlefield Earth” and, for Mueller, the prosecutorial version of “Dazed and Confused.”

The hearing was a disaster for anyone who was hoping for a kickstart to impeachment."
Democrats could not produce even a single takeaway moment in six hours of hearings.
"Instead, Mueller came across more often as befuddled than bemused by the entire exercise."
"Calling the hearings a “disaster” for Democrats, Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, a leading advocate for impeachment, declared, “Far from breathing life into his damning report, the tired Robert Mueller sucked the life out of it.”

ADVERTISEMENT

But of course, it did not matter."
No minds were changed.
"Furthermore, Democrats did not seem to care that Mueller was in open contempt of Congress by simply refusing to answer questions whenever it suited him."
"Indeed, that proved to be most questions."
The media coverage predictably ignored the fact that Mueller continually contradicted himself on what he would and would not answer.
"Instead, his curt refusals to answer legitimate questions were immediately described as evidence of his “reticence” and “discipline.” In fact, Mueller never even bothered to cite a legal basis to back up most of his refusals to answer questions."
He was allowed to discuss the underlying law as well as key decisions on the preparation of the report.
"All of these areas had been discussed by Attorney General William Barr Bill BarrHillicon Valley: Subpoenas for Facebook, Google and Twitter on the cards | Wray rebuffs mail-in voting conspiracies | Reps. raise mass surveillance concerns Bipartisan representatives demand answers on expired surveillance programs YouTube to battle mail-in voting misinformation with info panel on videos MORE and were neither privileged nor classified."
So why did he not answer these questions?
The answer is as simple as it is obvious.
He did not want to because he often had no answer.
"Moreover, he knew the Democrats were not going to insist on detailed answers."
"For example, Mueller refused to discuss whether Barr and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told him to submit his report with grand jury material identified, to allow for a rapid public release of the report."
"Indeed, that subject has already been discussed, and Mueller was clearly able to discuss it."
"However, he refused and no one bothered to point out that the attorney general had already established that this information could be discussed publicly."
The fact is that it was Mueller who delayed the release of the report by ignoring the instructions of his superiors.
"Likewise, Mueller clearly could have discussed, as did Barr, his legal interpretation of two memos from the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel that he claimed prevented him from reaching a conclusion on criminal obstruction."
This is a purely legal question.
Mueller answered questions about the Office of Legal Counsel when it suited him and then refused when it did not.
He started the second hearing before the House Intelligence Committee by withdrawing part of his earlier testimony before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the two memos.
Mueller is simply wrong in his interpretation of the memos insisting that you cannot indict a sitting president means that you cannot reach any conclusions in a report on his criminal conduct.
His two superiors made clear that his interpretation was wrong when they reached a conclusion on obstruction.
"Nothing in the memos restricted Mueller from reaching conclusions on criminal conduct, as his superiors made clear to him."
"Yet, Mueller avoided all of that by repeating his “I will not answer that” mantra."
"ADVERTISEMENT

Democrats were left repeating the same mantra that “no one is above the law” and demanding to know why no one has taken action."
It was a bizarre objection from a committee that has the authority to impeach President Trump Donald John TrumpSteele Dossier sub-source was subject of FBI counterintelligence probe Pelosi slams Trump executive order on pre-existing conditions: It 'isn't worth the paper it's signed on' Trump 'no longer angry' at Romney because of Supreme Court stance MORE.
"It was like a cop screaming, “Someone needs to arrest that guy!” Mueller continued with flagrantly conflicted answers."
He refused to answer questions about his prosecution but went into detail about his decisions on other issues like not subpoenaing Trump.
He did the same in refusing to discuss allegations in his own federal court filings but had no trouble holding forth on how WikiLeaks is a foreign intelligence operation or how answers from Trump were incomplete.
"On the latter question, Mueller even discussed other ways of describing the lack of cooperation from Trump after refusing to explain ambiguous lines in other parts of his report."
"Then he returned to his mantra and said things like “I do not want to wade into those waters.” Committee members shrugged it off, as if that is a new form of aquatic government privilege."
"In the end, Mueller testified in the same imperious fashion as his press conference two months ago when he declared, “I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner.” His declining to answer questions left the House committees in a glaring contradiction."
"When Barr testified substantively for hours without limitations, Democrats attacked him as uncooperative."
"But when Mueller demanded time limits and continually refused to answer nonprivileged questions that he clearly could answer, Democrats virtually cooed that he was only being reticent."
"Yet, Mueller did not seem up to the task of answering questions even when asked the name of the president who appointed him as a United States attorney."
"When he did answer a question clearly, he stumbled."
"In the first hearing, he agreed with Representative Ted Lieu of California that “the reason that you did not indict the president” is because of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion “that you cannot indict a sitting president” and then had to start out the second hearing by taking back that answer."
"Given his resistance to testifying and his request to have his chief of staff with him, the hearings successfully magnified the lingering questions over his supervision of the investigation."
It all was a testament to how a bad movie can ruin a good book.
"Film critic Joel Siegel once reviewed “The Bonfire of the Vanities” by saying, “This is a failure of epic proportions."
"You have got to be a genius to make a movie this bad.” If the Democrats wanted to dampen calls for impeachment, they could not have produced a better cinematic suppressant."
"Call it “The Day Impeachment Died.”

Have animal data been used inappropriately to estimate risks to humans from environmental trichloroethylene?
Trichloroethylene (TCE) is widely viewed as an environmental hazard.
"Its major metabolite, chloral hydrate, is a currently used medicine."
Regulation of TCE is based on a linear extrapolation from effects of high doses in rodents to risks for humans at low doses.
"However, metabolic, toxicologic, and epidemiologic data on trichloroethylene and chloral hydrate as well as water chlorination studies call this approach into question."
"The mechanism of carcinogenesis of TCE and chloral hydrate in rodents is nonlinear: very high doses, sufficient to cause cellular necrosis, are necessary."
Malignancy arises from repeated cycles of necrosis and regeneration with the ultimate emergence of hyperplasia and then neoplasia.
"Metabolites of TCE, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid, mediate this toxic effect of TCE."
"These chloroacetic acids also induce similar lesions in rodents given high doses of the medicine, chloral hydrate."
Human epidemiologic data show no increase in mortality or malignancy from substantial chronic exposure to trichloroethylene.
Chlorination of drinking water produces much higher levels of chloroacetic acids than could be obtained from metabolizing TCE under current regulations.
We conclude that the assumptions underlying current regulations are not applicable to TCE.
"Instead of a straight-line extrapolation model, a threshold model may be more appropriate."
The data suggest that it is possible to increase substantially the allowable trichloroethylene in drinking water without increasing health hazards.

The Secret to Keeping Your Dog Happy

Your
dog brings you joy."
"Do you ever look over at her while she is sleeping and
wonder if you make her as happy as she makes you?"
"Is she as glad to be yours as
you are to be hers?"
How do you know if your dog is content?
"All social species
have the same basic needs, just different ways those needs are fulfilled."
"Physiological Needs

Clean water - The most basic and most vital need for
dogs is fresh clean water."
Give your dog virtually unlimited access to water.
The only exception is limiting a few hours before bedtime when housetraining.
Keep water bowls clean and free of debris.
"Make sure outside water does not
freeze in winter or overheat in summer."
"Change water in outdoor containers
often."
Stagnant water can lead to disease.
"It doesn't have to be Evian, but it
should be fresh!"
"If your dog has a habit of knocking over her water bowl, it's
not because she doesn't want water."
"It's because dogs live in the right
now, and right now it's fun."
"It doesn't occur to her that later, she won't
have any water to drink."
Weighted water bowls will solve this problem.
"Good Nutrition - Ask a dozen people what dog food is the
best, you will get a dozen answers."
"The elusive Absolute Best Brand has not yet
revealed itself."
"However, there are better and worse choices."
"Feeding a quality
dog food means your dog will be healthier from the inside out - from a stronger
heart and bones to a shinier coat with less shedding and itching."
"The little
extra money spent on a better food is more than made up for in fewer Vet
visits."
"Nutritionally balanced dogs get sick much less often, fewer ear
infections, fewer outbreaks of worms, fewer UTIs, and even fewer injuries."
"There is even evidence that better food makes for a better behaved dog, as
well!"
"A quality dog food will have meat as at least the first 2 ingredients and
little or no corn as a filler."
Dogs are primarily meat eaters.
"If your dog has
a dull coat and flaky skin, it could be her food!"
"In addition to the right type of food,
your dog also needs the right amount of food."
"This is a case where you can get
too much of a good thing."
"Being overweight causes health problems in dogs just
as in people."
"Since dogs have a shorter life span than humans, the ill affects
are even more severe for them."
"Overweight dogs are not happy
dogs."
"Lucky for them, it's much easier for them to follow a diet than it
is for us."
We control their access to food.
"They can only eat as much as we
give them."
"Feed them a measured amount on a schedule, usually twice a
day, rather than free feeding."
"The dog food bag tells you how much to
give."
Even that is too much for some dogs.
"Observe your dog's weight and adjust
the amount you feed her accordingly."
"A dog is at her ideal weight when you can
easily feel the ribs and can see the outline of the ribs when the dog turns
sideways."
"She is underweight if you can see the ribs easily, and overweight if
the ribs and hip bones are not easily felt and she has no waist."
"Exercise - In addition to
proper nutrition, exercise is vital for good health."
"Not only will it increase
your dog's longevity, it will also decrease her unwanted behaviors."
"A dog's
energy has to go somewhere."
"If she doesn't get enough exercise, she may
find undesirable ways to expend that extra energy or even develop neuroses such
as obsessive spinning."
"Just as you should see your doctor before starting an
exercise program, so should your dog see hers!"
"Some breeds need more exercise
than others, and some cannot tolerate intense activity."
"Be sure your dog's
exercise program is right for her breed."
"Good Hygiene - It's true, dogs love to roll around in the stinkiest
thing they can find."
They don't seem to mind being dirty or smelly.
"However,
for a dog's overall happiness, cleanliness is next to dogliness!"
"Dogs may not
care how they smell, but people sure do."
"A smelly dog does not get petted by
people and generally isn't allowed in the house, and a dog shunned to the back
yard with little or no human contact is not a happy dog."
"Filthiness can also
lead to health problems."
"For example, dirty ears can lead to ear mites which
are itchy and can cause ear infections."
"Being too dirty can also be painful,
especially for a long-haired dog."
"Mats in a dog's fur pull on the skin and are
extremely uncomfortable."
"Nails that grow too long can cause a dog to walk
awkwardly and lead to problems in their joints and muscles."
"Keeping coats
brushed, ears cleaned, and nails trimmed is essential for a happy dog."
"Bathing
too often can lead to dry itchy skin."
"Dogs need a bath only when they start to
smell bad."
"If your dog is on a quality food, this won't be very often."
Chew Toys - Dogs have a physiological need to chew.
"This is especially true
for teething puppies."
"Providing them with safe chew toys will help them satisfy
this urge without having to gnaw on your coffee table."
"Thick rubber toys
like Kongs are a good option
because they will not break apart and become a choking or obstruction
hazard."
"Elimination - Dogs need reliable and sufficient opportunity to
eliminate away from their sleeping area."
"Normal healthy dogs will not
eliminate where they eat and sleep."
"Dogs who do use the bathroom
in their dens do so because they have learned that they will not be given
sufficient opportunity to eliminate elsewhere."
"For optimal happiness, make sure
your dog doesn't have to hold it too long."
"Shelter

In the wild, dogs are
able to seek out shelter when they need it to get out of the rain,
to shield themselves from the cold, or to find relief from the heat."
"In a
domestic environment, we keep them confined to a limited area."
"They don't have
the option to go out and look for adequate shelter."
"Therefore, it is up to us
to provide it."
"The ideal place for your dog when it's raining or cold is in the
home with you."
Most dogs are happiest living inside with you.
"It's also the
easiest way to provide appropriate shelter."
"However, if your dog is one of the
few who prefer living outdoors, or bringing her inside is not an option, you
can make sure she is well-sheltered outdoors."
"Some breeds are simply not equipped to deal with
cold weather and should not be left outside in winter."
"This includes most of
the small breeds and the short-coated large breeds, such as Dobermans."
"Remember, these are man-made dogs."
"Cropped coats and tiny dogs do not occur in
nature."
"Likewise, some breeds are not equipped to deal with the heat of SC
summers and should not be left outside in hot weather."
"This includes the arctic
breeds such as Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and St. Bernards."
"These
dogs living outdoors are not only unhappy dogs, they are also not
safe!"
They could literally die from the heat.
"Security

Happy dogs feel safe
in their environment from threats either real or perceived."
"Dogs who live
confined outdoors but without a physical fence are not secure."
"Invisible fences
and chains may keep the dog in the yard, but they do not keep other animals
out."
A dog living this way is a sitting duck.
"She is vulnerable to attacks from
coyotes, other dogs, and even mean people, and she has no way to escape."
"The
dog who lives this way is not a happy dog."
"A happy dog trusts her owner to not put her in
harm's way."
"She knows exactly what is expected of her and what happens when she
doesn't follow the rules."
"She does not fear her owner because she knows he will
do her no harm."
"She is also not overly dependent on her owner because she feels
secure in being alone sometimes."
A trained dog is a secure dog.
"Social Needs

Dogs
are social animals who thrive on companionship with others."
"They are unique in
the animal world because they enjoy companionship with people as much as they
do with other dogs."
"A dog who lives in a backyard with only minimal human
contact is a lonely dog, like a hermit living on an isolated mountain."
"The
happy dog gets lots of ear scritches and belly rubs."
"She gets to associate with
lots of different people and dogs because she has been well-socialized and
trained in basic obedience and manners."
"She is a dog who can go anywhere,
and people are happy to see her."
"Esteem Needs

Do dogs have a sense of self-esteem?"
"If
you doubt it, just watch a dog who has accomplished a complicated task."
"See how
she holds her head high and struts!"
"Dogs need to have confidence in themselves
and their ability to master tasks."
Training a dog builds her self-esteem.
"It
makes them feel good to master the perfect Sit and earn your appreciation!"
Learning tricks is fun for dogs.
"There are also all sorts of canine sports
available that dogs enjoy."
"Agility, flyball, ultimate frisbee, and lure
coursing are just some of the examples."
A dog with a hobby is a fulfilled dog.
"Cognitive Needs

Dogs are more than just instincts."
"They
also have the ability to think and problem solve."
"They need to experience more
than just the same old scenery of their own home."
"Mental stimulation leads to a
happy dog."
"Just walking a different path and letting her smell new smells
and see new sights provides mental stimulation."
"At home, puzzle toys like
the Buster
Cube let her put her brain to use."
"You can play games with her
like hiding and she has to find you, or hiding a treat that she has to find."
Learning new tricks also works her brain.
Put her to work.
"Make her fetch the
paper (make sure it's safe first) or bring you a drink from the fridge."
"Yes,
working makes for a happy dog!"
"The Secret to Happiness

The
meaning of life is to live it."
"The secret to a happy dog is to help her live a
fulfilled life."
That means she actively participates in it.
"She plays, goes
places, and does things."
"Basically, the secret to a happy dog is not much
different at all from the secret to a happy person."
"About Me

I am the proud pet-parent to the ever loving Bear."
Bear is a Northern Mutt who just happened to fall into my lap one cold October day.
"He was tiny and badly injured and for a while, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to whether or not he would survive to the end of the month."
But survive he did.
Bear has brought a great deal of love and happiness into my life.
He is a wonderful companion and the most loving friend.
"Genetics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a succinct review, future avenues and prospective clinical applications."
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is influenced by genetic and environmental factors.
A large number of candidate gene-association studies and genome-wide linkage scans have been conducted to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying this disease.
The compilation of these studies clearly revealed the complex genetic nature of COPD.
Multiple genes acting on specific environmental backgrounds are likely to be the tenet of this multifactorial disorder.
"Encouragingly, reproducible susceptibility genes, such as SERPINE2, were recently identified."
Advances in genomic research offer unprecedented capabilities to interrogate the human genome and are likely to accelerate the discovery of new genes.
A comprehensive catalogue of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD has great potential to lead to the development of new therapies and explain interindividual response to treatment.
One storyline thread that connected the David vs. Goliath narrative from the premiere through to the finale was Angelina's opening-episode confessional pointing out that women find vastly fewer idols than men.
"Angelina came up short in her own first-episode idol quest, and as the season progressed, and more and more idols were discovered by men, women continued to come away empty-handed."
"Until, that is, Angelina acquired the most labor-intensive clue ever for an in-camp idol: first she had to dig up a ladder, then she had to take it to a highly public place (the water well), then climb the ladder and retrieve the idol from a rock wall."
"In the process of digging up the ladder, Angelina dropped the clue, and, well ... hilarity ensued."
"But rest assured, in the end, Angelina eventually retrieved her idol (with the assistance, more or less, of Mike and Nick, above.)"
"In the process, she became the first woman since Lauren Rimmer in Season 35, and only the second since Kelley Wentworth in Season 31(!)"
to find an idol.
"(Not counting Legacy Advantages, at least.)"
"Angelina's stats were also pretty close to reality, as well."
"Over the complete history of hidden immunity idols in Survivor, women have found just 17 idols, versus 81 obtained by men (full list here), giving women just 17% of all idol finds."
"Worse yet, women (Lauren and Angelina) have found just 2 of the last 38."
What could possibly explain this disparity?
"This article, in collaboration with Sarah Channon at the Rob Has a Podcast blogs, is an attempt to answer that."
Sarah surveyed past players about whether camp gender roles (or other factors) played a part in this.
"Read the results of her findings here: ""Women and Idols: A Survivor Player's Guide""."
"In this article, we'll get fairly deep into the statistics."
"The short answer is: It's not clear why men have found so many idols, especially recently."
"The long answer is: There are a lot of small differences (and one large one), which when combined, may start to explain the men's commanding lead."
"The importance of being earliest

One key point to keep in mind for all of this idol-finding discussion is just how critical being the first person to find an idol at a particular camp is: There's only one idol per camp, at least until it's played."
"So if that camp's idol has already been found, it doesn't matter how much time anyone else spends searching after that, nobody else is going to find one."
"At least until the idol is played, or a swap, or the merge, and even then, there's no guarantee another idol will be hidden."
"Despite this somewhat obvious point, how early is earliest?"
"Not that early, as it turns out."
"But first, a word about the numbers (and then a surprise or two, we promise):

Methodology: Because we are comparing the ability of different contestants to find idols, we have removed all idols that had restricted access."
"For example, if an idol was only on Exile Island, we didn't consider it (so long, early season Super Idols, f***ing sticks, and Jon Misch's dual finds)."
"Also, if an idol was simply randomly distributed, say at the merge feast (sorry, Chris Noble) or during the opening scramble for items (sorry, Legacy Advantages), it was also ignored."
That should leave us with a pool of idols that everyone on a tribe theoretically could have found.
"We'll call these ""competitive"" idols."
"Additional note: We're also using the show's own timestamping here, and overlooking non-canon finding dates derived from post-game interviews, such as Domenick Abbate's re-telling that his Naviti idol find was on Night 1, not the early hours of Day 4, as was depicted in Ghost Island."
"We get it, sometimes the show needs to move finds to different episodes to fit them in."
But the show's official timeline is all we really have to work with.
"So, using the criteria above, we're looking at 85 total ""competitive"" idols found, spanning 24 seasons (Guatemala, Fiji, and China, then Samoa to the present day)."
"Of these, 71 were found by men, 14 by women."
"These numbers are actually slightly worse than the gender disparity for all idols, with men finding 83.5% of competitive idols, and women only 16.5% of them."
But there are islands of interesting and/or surprising news.
"Here's our first surprise: Of the 85 idols that made this cut, only five were found in the first three days."
That's probably great news for people panicking about splitting votes at the first Tribal Council.
"Even more surprising, women found four of these idols, and just one was found by a man (Dan Rengering, just this past season, although technically also Dom in the previous one)."
A whopping 4:1 female:male ratio!
"From there, however, it gets progressively more grim for women: During the next three-day period (Days 4-6), 13 men and zero women have found idols.With 24 seasons covered in this data set, that means if you're going to Tribal by the end of Day 6, there's a decent chance someone might have an idol (18 idols... although with 45 initial tribes, the actual rate is a bit lower)."
"Conversely, there's a better than 1-in-2 chance that your tribe's idol is still out there, somewhere."
Keep hope alive!
"Here's a complete graph of idol finds by men and women over each three-day period (up until idols expire at F5):

Figure 1: Idols found per three-day span."
Tracking (competitive) idols found by men (blue bars) vs. idols found by women (red bars) per three-day period of the game.
"As you can see, there's a lot of noise (mostly due to relatively small sample sizes), but the bulk of the finds are from days 4-12, which corresponds roughly to when players are still in their original tribes."
"Comparing finds by men vs. women: apart from that first-episode blip, there are (almost) no times at which women predominate in idol discovery."
"In fact, if you simplify this down to the three main phases of the game (original tribes, post-swap, and post-merge) the percent of idols found by men is remarkably consistent: Between 82% and 88% in all three phases."
(Table below.)
"Table I: Idol finds by phase of game Game phase Men Women % Men % Women Original tribes 32 7 82% 18% Post-swap 15 2 88% 12% Post-merge 24 5 83% 17%

Being the first to find an idol is also important for another reason, especially recently: In seasons where idols are hidden using a common theme/ clue system (i.e."
"every season from Millennials vs. Gen X to the present), finding an idol early gives the contestant an advantage at finding a second (or third) idol later."
"David Wright took advantage of that in MvGX, Tai Trang in Game Changers, Joe Mena in HvHvH, and Davie Rickenbacker in David vs. Goliath."
"So for those later-game idol finds, that may come into play more frequently."
"Below, we've graphed first finds vs. repeat finds, by time."
Figure 2: Timing of initial vs. repeat idol finds.
"This graph tracks the discovery of second and third idols over the various phases of the game, relative to initial idol finds."
"As you'd expect, there's a surge of first-time idol finds at the start of the game."
The second and/or third idol finds pick up around the time of the swap (Dan Rengering used his knowledge of the David vs Goliath pattern to find the newly-minted Tiva idol after the swap).
"Repeat idol finds peter off again around the merge, then surge once more toward the end of the game (picking up as idols are finally played, then re-hidden)."
So who is doing all this re-finding of idols?
We don't need a graph for that: Almost exclusively men.
"Exactly one of the 21 second or third idols found in a single season has been found by a woman: Kelley Wentworth's second idol, found under the shelter on Day 28 of Cambodia."
Let's look at this in a bit more detail.
Below is a graph charting how many competitive first idols and repeat idols (second or third) have been found by men and by women.
Figure 3: Historic rates of male and female initial and repeat (competitive) idol finds.
Total idol finds by men (blue bars) and repeat finds (green bars) over the course of seasons 11-37 (Guatemala to David vs. Goliath).
Contrasted with total finds by women (red bars) and repeat finds (purple bar).
Female finds shown in the reverse orientation for better visual contrast.
"Looking at the ebb and flow of male and female finding rates over time, some trends are visible."
"There's an initial, low-level, male-only phase in the early days."
"Then the Russell Hantz era (seasons 19-20) features the debut of repeat finds, and a surge in overall idol play."
"Since then, we've had a bit of back-and-forth between multi-season stretches where men and women find idols at relatively similar rates (with few repeat idol finds - mostly just blue bars and red bars), and extended orgiastic frenzies of male-dominated finding and repeat finding (a whole lot of blue and green bars)."
"The S21 (Nicaragua) through S25 (Philippines) run was one of relative parity, then S26 (Caramoan) through S28 (Cagayan) cranked up the numbers for the men."
"Balance resumed from S29 (San Juan del Sur) through S31 (Cambodia), but then we entered into our current unbroken (almost) all-dude, repeat-heavy run from S33 (MvGX) on."
"(Kaoh Rong, which was filmed before S31, but aired before S33, sort of fits in both groups.)"
"What's different about the male-dominated stretches, what separates them from the more balanced periods?"
"One simple explanation is that it's not anything intrinsic to game structure in those seasons, and it's just an increase in aggressive, extremely idol-focused male players: Your Russell Hantzes, Malcolm Frebergs, Tony Vlachoses, and Tai Trangs.This is difficult to disprove: They really do account for a large number of idol finds, all by themselves (they're among the top in career idol finders, and have found 15 idols total, just between the four of them)."
But perhaps that helps to highlight part of the men's advantage: repeat idol finds.
Just look at the seasons with the tallest blue bars in Fig.
3: They all have green bars.
"In recent seasons, the hiding system has conferred an advantage once it was known (""look for string,"" simple map on a tree, pour water on the side of the well, etc.)."
"If exclusively men were finding those first idols, they'd be expected to have an advantage in finding the next one."
"In the past six seasons, women haven't found *any* of the original tribal idols, and when they have found idols, it's been really late in the game, when the hiding system has been abandoned."
"Lauren found hers on Day 31 of HvHvH, and it didn't follow the previous pattern."
"Angelina found hers on Day 36 of David vs. Goliath, one day before it expired."
Both idols also required additional work to complete the find.
"Two or more idols: An advantage found

So just how much more likely is a prior idol-finder than a non-finder to find another idol at later point in the game?"
"That's actually something we can calculate directly, using the stats we have."
"To do this (sorry, more boring methodology ahoy), we went back to the list of idol finds, and asked whether the finder had previously found one that season (the ""Prior?"""
"column in the ""Repeat Finds"" spreadsheet tab, here, and in Table III below) or if it was a new find (the ""New?"""
column).
We also counted the number of previous finders and non-prior finders present in camp who were in competition for that idol.
This gives us a total of 39 idols that were found when at least one prior idol-finder could have been searching for it.
"If there's no advantage to previously having found an idol, we'd expect the prior finders' discovery rate to be approximately the same as their proportion of the tribe."
"Here's the available pool of people who could have found idols:

Table II: Potential idol-finders when prior finders were present Men at finding Women at finding Previous finders Non-prior finders 163 138 66 235

And here's the sorting of those who actually did find idols:

Table III: Who actually found idols, when prior finders were present Men Women Prior?"
New?
"32 7 21 18

At first glance, these results seem like a good news thing, right?"
"Although 21 prior idol-finders found a second (or third) one in finds where prior finders were present, a similar-seeming 18 new people were still able to out-compete the veterans and grab their own first idol."
Almost parity!
Huzzah!
"(Still a lot of dudes coming up idol-handed, though.)"
"But now look back at the previous table (Table II): the newbies outnumbered the prior finders 235 to 66, a ratio of almost 4-to-1."
Yet they weren't even able to muster a full 1-1 finding ratio.
"In summary: Bad job, newbies."
"If this were truly a level playing field, with 39 idols found and only 22% of the people present having found idols before, you would expect those prior finders to find just 8.6 idols."
"Instead, the prior finders found 21 idols, which is 2.5 times the expected rate."
(This is huge!
They needed this!)
"And again, all but one of those repeat finds was by a man, a 20-to-1 ratio, with just Kelley Wentworth keeping women from being completely shut out."
"This doesn't explain the entire gender imbalance, obviously, since men have found (non-restricted) idols at five times the rate of women."
But that's a significant contributor.
"An important caveat: This is a correlation, we can't say definitively that it's causative."
"(Even though it clearly is in some situations, like James in China or Tai in Game Changers.)"
"As a counterexample, men found 32 idols in this subset, while women only found 7."
"54% of the contestants present were men, so men found idols at 1.5-fold higher rate than their overall representation."
Do men just naturally find idols at 1.5x the rate of women?
Obviously not.
"Yet if we look just at the first-time idol finders overall, removing all the repeat finds, men still outnumber women 51 to 13 (a clean 80% / 20% split)."
So repeat finds are clearly not the only reason for men finding more idols than women.
"Even so, this bonus round of finding idols could be made more equitable."
"At the very least, Survivor should consider moving away from hiding initial tribe idols in exactly the same way."
Mix it up!
"Throw one in a tree, put one near the well, or even bury some in camp, like in Fiji."
"Sure, it's fun when someone finds more than one idol."
But it can't hurt to make them work for it as much as possible.
"To be fair to production, having an idol ""theme"" was probably came from wanting fairness: Everyone in each original camp truly has an equivalent chance at finding an idol."
"But obviously, that fairness completely reverses itself during a swap."
"Still, the main question remains: Why are men finding so many of the first-time idols?"
"Tribal gender balance: A slight advantage at best

Conceptually, it would make sense if the number of men or women on a tribe affected whether a man or a woman found an idol."
"For example, when Parvati (and Danielle) dug up an idol at Villains camp in Heroes vs. Villains, there were five women on the tribe, but just one man (Russell)."
"You'd expect women to be finding idols pretty frequently if they have a 5:1 numbers advantage, right?"
And so they did.
"Conversely, it wasn't particularly likely that a woman would find an idol when Gabby was the only female David left (vs. four men), and they went on their early morning group idol hunt, was it?"
(Spoiler alert: She didn't.)
"So yes, in extreme cases of tribal gender disparity, we'd expect to see unbalanced idol-finding."
But tribal gender ratios that far from parity rarely happen.
"What about the rest of the cases, when the male-female differential is smaller?"
"To see if gender balance in camp correlated with idol-finding gender ratios, we counted up the number of men and women present in that tribe's camp at the time each idol was found, then added up all the numbers, and compared the gender ratio when men found idols, vs. the gender ratio when women found idols."
"The result: Men are slightly overrepresented in camp at times when men find idols, and the reverse is also true for women."
"But only by a tiny amount: 53.9% men, but that's for all idols found."
"Looking just at first idols, there's a big drop, all the way down to ... 53.8% men."
Table IV: Tribe composition when men find idols No.
"of idols Men at finding Women at finding % men % women All idols 71 287 245 53.9% 46.1% First idols 50 212 182 53.8% 46.2%

Here are the similarly underwhelming stats for women finding idols."
"Again, women are slightly overrepresented in camp when they find idols (again, small dataset, almost all of the difference comes from that Parvati/Danielle find in HvsV): :

Table V: Tribe composition when women find idols No."
"of idols Men at finding Women at finding % men % women All idols 14 56 59 48.7% 51.3% First idols 13 51 55 48.1% 51.9%

Clearly, the gender ratios on tribes can't be the (main) reason why men find more idols than women."
Something else must be going on.
"Rather than adding all the numbers together, perhaps it would be informative to look at the tribal gender differential (the number of men minus the number of women), and how that correlates with idol finding:

Figure 5: Idol finds vs. tribal gender differential."
Total idol finds by men (blue bars) or by women (red bars) sorted by the difference in men vs. women on the tribe at the time the idol was found.
"For men, we see a near-Gaussian distribution, but with a sharp drop-off on the right-hand shoulder, as tribes start to contain more women."
"For women, the same is probably true, although it's less obvious, since we're working with much smaller numbers."
But one clear takeaway: Women have found zero idols when men outnumber women by more than one.
"(To be fair, men have found just two idols, ever, when they were outnumbered by more than one, also.)"
So... maybe the question we should ask instead is: How often are women outnumbered by men?
Could there just be too few women?
"There's a valid reason to ask whether tribal (or overall) gender differentials matter: David vs. Goliath and Millennials vs. Gen X were both fun seasons (and had a lot of idols), but they also hit their respective merges with a relative paucity of women still present."
Could the rise of male-exclusive idol finding in recent seasons such as these just be a reflection of men being over-represented in general?
This is a complex question to answer.
"We already looked at whether women were underrepresented on the specific tribes where men found idols, and the answer was: Not really."
"But as MvGX and DvsG show, there's an overarching, slightly more meta difference that starts to stand out when you look at the season as a whole, or the recent past set of seasons, and not just the tribe where the idol was found."
"There's a tendency for women to be voted out early in the game, which as we saw in Fig."
"1, is when a big part of the surge in male first-time idol-finding takes place."
"To demonstrate this, we tracked the gender differential (number of men minus the number of women) for each day of the game through to Day 38 (where the last vote-out occurs, at least until the advent of F4 firemaking)."
"We restricted this analysis to the last 17 seasons, where — as we saw in Fig."
3 — we've seen both balanced seasons and unbalanced seasons for men and women finding idols.
Figure 6: Cumulative gender differential for the past 17 seasons (Nicaragua through David vs. Goliath).
Gender differential = (number of men present) minus (number of women present) at the end of each day of the game.
"As you can see, men start off ahead (thanks, San Juan del Sur), build up a sizable early lead (a cumulative 14-man lead by Day 7), give some of it back, then steadily climb to a peak of +26 men at Day 20."
"Staying true to the frequent pre-merge mantra of ""keep the tribe strong."""
"Again, those numbers are so large because this is the sum of 17 seasons, but if there was no consistent trend for one or the other gender to be targeted, we'd expect to see a flat line at around zero the whole way."
"Day 20 is around the time of the merge, which means at that point (taking the average of 17 seasons), men have a mean numbers advantage of 1.5, every merge."
"Certainly, things start to even out after that, as men viewed as physical threats are frequent post-merge targets, and we end up close to gender parity again by Day 38."
But it's hard to overlook that the pre-merge is a dangerous time to be a woman playing Survivor.
And that this is when a lot of idol finding takes place.
Does the common pre-merge targeting of women have a direct effect on idol finding?
"On the one hand: Men have found 13 idols (and women zero) from days 16-21, a time at which men go from net +17 to net +23."
That seems like a good fit.
"But in reality, the effect is probably not direct."
"We can roughly demonstrate that by comparing the cumulative gender differential for the seasons that were fairly balanced in men and women finding idols (S21-S25, S29-S31) vs. the cumulative gender differential for the unbalanced, male-dominated seasons (S26-S28, S32-S37)."
Figure 7: Comparing gender differential seasons with balanced idol finding vs. unbalanced.
"Cumulative gender differential for balanced seasons (S21-S25, S29-S31) vs. unbalanced (S26-S28, S32-S37) by day of game."
"Here, if the gender differential had a direct effect, we'd expect to see more men present in the unbalanced seasons, and more women during the balanced seasons."
"Instead, both curves look more or less the same, at least up until about Day 30, when they split apart in the directions you'd expect."
But that's probably too late to affect idol-finding numbers significantly.
"At the very least, there's no effect on that Day 16-21 period we mentioned before."
"What's more likely is that women, knowing they are likely early targets, tend not to engage in aggressive idol-finding during the pre-merge phase, then maybe start to look for idols later in the game, as we saw with Lauren in HvHvH."
"This is something Sarah Channon gleaned from her survey responses (the ""Weighing up the risk: Why not?"""
section).
"Maybe if we see a multi-season swing in which men are predominantly targeted pre-merge, we might see a commensurate rise in pre-merge idol finding by women?"
Maybe.
Or maybe it's more realistic to hope for a structural change that gives women a better shot at idol finding.
"More variable finding: some international examples

One of the key findings above is that the themed idol-hiding system from recent seasons amplifies the already existent (but still mostly inexplicable) disparity between male and female idol finders."
So for a different system — and outcome — let's look to some international Survivor versions from the past year.
"Survivor NZ: Thailand featured the debut of idols in the Survivor NZ franchise, and they were fairly evenly distributed: (1) an idol clue won at the Outpost by a woman (Tess Fahey) directed her to find it at the next IC, although she shared the clue with her male alliancemates, and one of them (Brad Norris) picked it up; (2) an idol clue in the reward fishing gear, found by a woman (Eve Clarke); (3) another clue for an idol back at camp, tucked into a table at the Outpost, found by a man (Dave Lipanovic); and (4) an idol in camp, marked by an arrow on the ground, which a man and woman (Matt Hancock and Lisa Stanger) saw at the same time, although Matt ended up getting the idol."
"With the possible exception of Dave's idol, any of those could have gone to either a man or a woman."
"For perhaps a better example, with even more idol finds and perfect gender balance, let's look at the idol-finding results from Survivor AU: Champions vs."
Contenders.
"(And sure, we haven't had nearly enough tables yet, so why not add another?)"
Table VI: Champions vs.
"Contenders idol finds Player M/F Day found Where found Notes Russell Hantz M 2 Tree near camp Found without a clue, but Russell was voted out without playing it."
"Moana Hope F 8 Tribal Council Found a clue in camp, under the reward feast table (similar clue at the other camp, at the water well) saying an idol would be in the voting urn lid."
"Shane Gould F 15 Under reward item Hidden in camp, underneath a table with the ice bucket that held the reward drinks."
"Heath Davies M 17 Tribe flag Found the clue in the flag frame, directing him to dig under the flag for the idol."
"Benji Wilson M 27 Island near camp Benji found the clue in camp, directing him to grab the idol at low tide; eventually did so at night."
"Sharn Coombes-1 F 37 Challenge Sharn found a clue in camp, with directions on retrieving the idol at the next IC."
"She did so, very publicly (whoops)."
Brian Lake M 38 At reward Brian found a clue in the ice chest at reward; idol hidden under the reward building's steps.
"Sharn Coombes-2 F 43 Near well In-camp idol, in a tree near the water well."
"There you go: Perfectly even distribution between men and women (4: 4), a huge variety of hiding mechanisms and locations, including a really fun idol that could have gone to anyone on either tribe, hidden in the voting urn lid at Tribal Council."
(U.S.
Survivor should absolutely steal that idea.)
"A woman even found two idols, and one of the men was even our old friend, Russell Hantz!"
"Russell in fact found the only idol that wasn't in a high-traffic public area, all the others were either in camp or near the water well (or at reward)."
"Both Survivor NZ and Survivor AU may have chosen these distribution mechanisms to cut down on the need for additional camera crews to be chasing everyone around in the jungle, but if a side effect of that is more balanced idol finding, what's the harm in that?"
"Take note, U.S."
Survivor.
"Not one for the ages: Idol disparities are a gender-specific problem

We see the massive gender divide in idol finding, but could other variables be just as significant?"
"Sarah Channon suggested we might also check whether idol finding also had disparities with respect to some other characteristic, such as age."
"This is a little more complicated to analyze than gender, since while (almost) every season starts with a clean 50-50 split of men and women, the age range within seasons varies widely, from heavily skewed towards early-20s players (Ghost Island) to overloaded with more mature players (Cambodia)."
So it'll take a bit more effort to see if the people finding idols diverge from the overall population.
"Even with those caveats in mind, while we clearly see a massive disparity by gender, when we compare idol finds by age vs. the age distribution within Survivor contestants as a whole, we see virtually no difference."
"This is a little surprising, actually, since many of the elite idol finders (Russell Hantz, Tony Vlachos, Tai Trang) have been older:

Figure 8: Idol finders vs. all contestants, by age."
Percentage of all contestants in (roughly) five-year age bins (red bars) vs. percentage of competitive idol finders of those same ages (blue bars).
"Includes seasons 11, 14-15, 17, and 19-37."
We grouped players into five-year age bins to give a little more heft to the numbers.
"We've also shown the size of the group as a percentage of the total group, because of the vastly different numbers (483 total players in the 24 seasons we're covering, vs. just 85 idol finders)."
"If there's any difference, it's that early-20s players find fewer idols than might be expected from their percentage of the cast, and that maybe contestants in their early (31-35) and late 30s (36-40) find more idols than would otherwise be expected."
But even these differences are less than two-fold away from the expected distribution.
"That's obviously far smaller than the observed drought of idol-finding women, which is greater than 4:1 (and even higher in the past six seasons)."
"Looking ahead: More variety, fewer jungle idols?"
It's hard to pin the idol-finding gender disparity down to just one factor.
"Certainly, the ease of repeat idol finds (coupled with men recently finding most of the original idols) plays a part."
"Most likely, however, the problem results from a blend of different things, maybe even things we can't measure directly."
Sarah Channon's survey revealed a frequent complaint among Survivor women: Gender roles at camp.
"Many felt it was less acceptable for a woman to be absent (alone) from camp, for any reason, than it was for a man."
"Men could go fishing alone, since there's only one mask/snorkel and Hawaiian sling."
Women couldn't.
"Men collect wood for the fire and shelter, women get assigned duties that keep them in camp, except perhaps to gather water (rarely alone)."
Couple that social hierarchy with the very real trend that women are generally targeted before the merge (Fig.
"6), and there's even more incentive for women to stick to those assigned gender roles and stay in camp, lest they become early targets."
That matches up with the same time when men are finding all the original tribal idols (see Fig.
1 and Table I).
"So moving forward, what should Survivor try to do?"
The lessons from international Survivor seem the easiest to implement.
Having more idols actually hidden in camp could be one way to reverse the current male-dominated trend.
Returning to the old system of clues (or even idols) concealed within rewards is another.
Simply varying the idol distribution method would also help.
Just adding more variety would perhaps be the best approach.
"If the idols are always off in the jungle where women rarely feel allowed to venture, they're almost always going to be found by men."
"Vary the locations, vary the way the idols are hidden, and we should see something closer to equitable idol finding."
"""I'm a sex addict,"" opines Chazz Michael Michaels in the complex world cinema classic Blades of Glory."
"""It's a real disease with doctors and medicine and everything."""
"Today, it seems unthinkable that celebrity sex addiction was once misdiagnosed as hot famous millionaires just taking their opportunities, or something that stars claimed when they couldn't handle taking responsibility for being an arsehole, in the same way that Mel Gibson went to rehab for being antisemitic and Naomi Campbell did a spell for hitting the help."
Thank God we've moved on.
"The sadness, of course, is wondering what undiagnosed sex addicts of more benighted days – your Mick Jaggers, your Warren Beattys – might have achieved had they not had to suffer this affliction in private."
"So when Tiger Woods took to his podium last week, he did so not just for himself, but for all those icons of yesteryear who never got to stand up and say ""Yes, I had sex with a number of readily available women, and I am continuing with months – months!"
"– of in-patient care to treat this illness""."
"It's now time to ""move on"" from Tiger's apology, in the parlance of these things."
"And yet, for those of us who actually like sport, as opposed to being part of that increasing and increasingly irksome demographic which just tunes in for the kiss-and-tells and apologies, the appearance afforded a worrying glimpse of a formerly near-invincible athlete."
Is rehab going to ruin Tiger Woods's game?
"I can only hope it was his sponsors Tiger was trying to appease with the display, and not his therapists, because you have to suspect that any medical professional who regards such craven public nonsense as ""part of the journey"" means nothing less than to dismantle perhaps the greatest golfer ever to have played."
"Part of what made Woods such a breathtakingly formidable opponent was his mental impenetrability, and before this whole saga broke there were those who felt he should radically alter his demeanour in order to appease everything from the social mores of the PGA tour to the demands of their editors to their own personal sense of importance."
I can't say I was ever one of them.
"Barring illegality, whatever made him play like that was pretty much OK by me."
"Post the exposé, none of us is entitled to think our speculation on his marriage is remotely relevant."
"If you feel personally ""let down"" by Woods's behaviour, then you could do with a spell in a head spa yourself."
"But now that Woods is undergoing a questionably necessary mental rebuild by behavioural therapists, and has made such a deliberate play of involving the world in his ""recovery"", we are entitled to wonder what sort of golfer will emerge at the end of it all."
Will he really be the same?
"Self-doubt might be a nice quality for a billionaire athlete husband to discover, particularly if he has a lot of spare time away from home on his hands, but it is less of an asset in a would-be major winner."
"Listening to Woods describe the new him, it felt like he was being encouraged to shed many of his defining qualities in the cause of his recovery."
"Ferocious singlemindedness, a lone wolf mentality, immense self-belief – these are not really the kinds of things that therapists wish you to hang on to, but they were the essence of Woods the golfer."
"According to his statement, the new Woods has learned to lean on his peers."
Yet the open flippancy with which some of them on the PGA tour have been talking about him since the story broke suggests his ability to intimidate them on the course might have been severely compromised by the way it has played out.
"New Tiger says it's no longer about what you achieve but ""what you overcome"", apparently sublimating his sex addiction into the challenge of his career."
"As Simon Barnes observed in the Times the other day, he seems intent on becoming ""the best therapy-undergoer ever""."
Wherever you place World Rehab No1 in your list of covetable accolades – I'd stick it above Best Yodeler but below Best Laundry Lint Collector – this sort of shtick doesn't seem to augur belief-defying feats of golf.
I'd genuinely love to be proved wrong.
And far be it from me to suggest that the therapists of the Pine Grove Behavioural Health and Addiction Clinic are yips-merchants.
"But on the basis of last week's horror show, one can dream of staging a reverse intervention and getting Woods the hell out of there before they work any more of their magic."

In CSS: how to specify the font you want as being BOTH monospace and sans-serif?"
"I'd like to tell the browser to use a font that is both monospace and sans-serif (usually the default monospace font has serifs, and the default sans-serif font isnt monospaced)."
Is there any way to specify this in CSS other than to provide a list of fonts I know to fit my criteria?

"Barge carrying munitions to Indian Island freed after going aground near Anacortes

ANACORTES â€” A barge carrying cargo that included an estimated 9,000 of pounds of Navy munitions bound for Naval Magazine Indian Island ran aground early Monday morning on Belle Rock near Anacortes."
"The 322-foot barge St. Elias was pulled free late Monday afternoon after salvage divers inspected its hull and determined it could be safely moved, according to Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Robert K. Lanier in Seattle."
The barge was towed to the middle of the shipping channel where it was undergoing further checks by the Coast Guard and state Department of Ecology inspectors as night fell.
"Earlier in the day a 2,000-yard safety zone had been cleared around the barge, but Lanier said Navy explosives experts had gone aboard and determined that the explosives were secure and safe."
"Indian Island, their destination, is the Navy ammunition and weapons storage depot across from Port Townsend."
"Lanier said the St. Elias, being towed by the 101-foot tugboat Henry Brusco, ran aground at about 5:20 a.m. Monday on Belle Rock in Rosario Strait about five miles southwest of Anacortes."
No injuries were reported in the grounding.
"Local, state and federal agencies responded to the scene."
"The crew of a Port Angeles-based Coast Guard helicopter that flew over the site reported no indication of an oil spill, but as a precaution an oil-containment boom was placed around the barge."
"Other cargo on the barge included produce, fish and automobiles, Lanier said."

"The greater the anxiety level, the higher risk of having a stroke, according to new research published in the American Heart Association journal Stroke."
The study is the first in which researchers linked anxiety and stroke independent of other factors such as depression.
Anxiety disorders are one of the most prevalent mental health problems.
"Symptoms include feeling unusually worried, stressed, nervous or tense."
"Over a 22-year period, researchers studied a nationally representative group of 6,019 people 25-74 years old in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey."
"Participants underwent an interview and took blood tests, medical examinations and completed psychological questionnaires to gauge anxiety and depression levels."
Researchers tracked strokes through hospital or nursing home reports and death certificates.
"After accounting for other factors, they found that even modest increases in anxiety were associated with greater stroke risk."
People in the highest third of anxiety symptoms had a 33 percent higher stroke risk than those with the lowest levels.
“Everyone has some anxiety now and then.
"But when it’s elevated and/or chronic, it may have an effect on your vasculature years down the road,” said Maya Lambiase, Ph.D., study author and cardiovascular behavioral medicine researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pittsburgh."
"People with high anxiety levels are more likely to smoke and be physically inactive, possibly explaining part of the anxiety-stroke link."

General:
In our sample of 139 studies, 10 General articles (7%) covered Wikipedia-related issues very broadly, covering a wide swath of aspects of Wikipedia in the study that cannot be confined to any of our other major categories."
"Because of the diversity of this category, it is difficult to draw summary conclusions for the entire category."
"Nonetheless, we present the general findings in this section."
1.
"Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device using a lead frame and a method of manufacturing the same."
2.
"Description of the Related Art
A portable electronic device has been downsized in recent years, and a semiconductor package to be used in a semiconductor device has accordingly been required to be downsized and thinned while securing a mounting strength."
"Employing a surface mount package has been known as a measure for downsizing the semiconductor package, in which an external terminal protrudes in parallel to a substrate mounting surface."
Examples of this package type include a small outline non-lead package (SON) and a quad flat non-lead package (QFN).
"Those packages have a feature in that an external electrode required for mounting the package on a substrate is smaller than that of a dual inline package (DIP) or a small outline package (SOP), and hence a small amount of solder fillet is formed after the package is mounted on the substrate, and a mounting strength is low."
"Further, those packages are often manufactured with use of a lead frame produced by using a stamping mold or etching process."
"As a material of the lead frame, a 194 alloy or a copper alloy is used in general."
"In manufacturing of the semiconductor device using the lead frame, a semiconductor chip is mounted on the lead frame, and the semiconductor chip and the lead frame are electrically connected to each other via wires."
"The resultant structure is then subjected to resin encapsulation process and deburring process, and exterior plating process is carried out on the copper surface."
"After the exterior plating process, the semiconductor device is cut off from the lead frame so as to have a predetermined size."
"As described above, the semiconductor device is cut off from the lead frame after the exterior plating process, and hence no exterior plated film is formed on a cut surface of an outer lead."
Accordingly there arises a problem that the solder wetting is poor when the semiconductor device is mounted on the substrate.
"In order to improve the mounting strength of the semiconductor package produced under such conditions, it is proposed that the shape of an outer lead distal end portion be changed in plan view or cross-sectional view so that the solder wetting after the semiconductor device is mounted on the substrate is improved and a solder fillet is thus easily formed, to thereby increase the mounting strength (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos."
2006-19465 and Hei 7-45769).
"However, along with the progress in downsizing and thinning of a semiconductor device, it is required to further improve the substrate mounting strength of the semiconductor device."

Crime Down in Downtown St. Louis...Again

The Downtown St. Louis Partnership has reported the latest crime figures for downtown:

According to the St. Louis Police Department, compared to January 2007, reported crime in the 4th District (which includes Downtown and Downtown West) is down."
"The statistics are as follows: Property crime (larceny, vehicle theft and arson) down 26.8%; Burglaries (business and residential) down 58%; Total burglaries in Downtown West went from 16 in 2007 down to 1 in 2008; and, Car clottings/break-ins are down 37.7%, a decrease of 52 reported incidents."
A handful of streets in the Whaley Park neighborhood near Cal State Long Beach have been added to a permit parking district that bars non-residents — and students — from parking on the streets for more than an hour during the weekdays.
"The change came at the request of homeowners on Los Santos Drive, just north of Atherton Street, who had seen an influx of vehicles in their neighborhood during the 2016-17 academic year."
A traffic study showed that approximately 90 percent of the vehicles parked on the street did not belong to residents.
"In response, the City Council recently adopted an ordinance that enabled the immediate creation of the parking district, just in time for the fall semester to start."
"Parking problems around Cal State Long Beach are nothing new to surrounding neighborhoods, many of which have established permit parking districts."
"But for the homeowners around Whaley Park, the situation swelled after university officials implemented a policy that bars freshman students living in campus dorms from obtaining residential parking permits."
Students are instead encouraged to use public transit or alternative methods of transportation.
"Councilman Daryl Supernaw, who represents the council district that includes the university, said neighbors saw the impacts of the policy change almost immediately."
"“It took these college students about a day to figure out, ‘If I can’t take my car to the parking lot, I will just take it into the neighborhood,’” he said."
"Segments of the following streets have been added to Preferential Parking District U: Los Santos Drive, Chatwin Avenue, Marber Avenue, Garford Street, San Anseline and Lave Avenue."
"Parking signs posted in the neighborhoods limit parking to one hour between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays."
Donald Trump added to the confusion about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un by claiming he has a “very good idea” about the dictator’s condition.
Mr Kim’s whereabouts and health status have been a subject of intense speculation after Seoul-based website Daily NK reported last week he was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on 12 April.
"“I can’t tell you exactly,” the US president said when asked about Kim’s condition at a White House news conference on Monday."
"“Yes, I do have a very good idea, but I can’t talk about it now."
"I just wish him well.”

Suggesting the mystery would soon be cleared up, Mr Trump added: “I hope he’s fine."
I do know how he’s doing relatively speaking.
"We will see – you’ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future.”

Yet the president appeared to contradict himself only moments later when he said “nobody knows where he is”."

It comes as the North Korea authorities publishing a letter purportedly from Mr Kim to South African president Cyril Ramaphosa – dated 27 April – as “proof” that he is alive and well."
State media have previously reported that he sent greetings to Syrian president Bashar Assad and Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel.
"Not seen in public since 11 April, the leader’s absence from public ceremonies on the birth anniversary of his grandfather Kim Il Sung on 15 April was unprecedented – leading to days of speculation over his health."
South Korean officials have cautioned against reports that Kim may be ill and emphasised they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea.
"Donald Trump speaking at a news conference on 27 April, 2020 (AFP via Getty Images) (AFP/Getty)

South Korea’s minister for North Korean affairs said on Tuesday that Mr Kim may have missed the key holiday because of concerns over the coronavirus, not because he is ill.

“It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim Il Sung’s birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns,” Kim Yeon-chul said at a parliamentary hearing."
He said there were at least two instances since mid-January where Kim Jong Un was out of sight for nearly 20 days.
"“I don’t think that’s particularly unusual given the current [coronavirus] situation.”

A special train possibly belonging to Mr Kim was spotted last week at the North Korean resort town of Wonsan, according to satellite images reviewed by 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project."
"Despite Mr Trump’s claim to have a “very good idea” about his condition, experts said nobody outside North Korea knew exactly what was happening."
"Cheon Seong Whun, a presidential secretary during the South Korea’s previous conservative government, said Seoul had struggled for several decades to get a strong grip on the location and health of North Korea’s top leadership."
"“Anybody who says they know something for certain is just writing a novel,” Mr Cheon said."

Introduction {#sec004}
============

Dengue fever (DF) is a febrile illness caused by the dengue virus, which is further classified into four serotypes (Dengue virus 1--4), and transmitted by *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* mosquitoes \[[@pntd.0007350.ref001]\]."
Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection of humans in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
"Approximately 2 to 4 billon people are at risk of contracting dengue virus every year, resulting in nearly 100 million confirmed cases and causing ongoing wide concern \[[@pntd.0007350.ref002]--[@pntd.0007350.ref005]\]."
"After the founding of the People's Republic of China, DF was eliminated in mainland China."
"However, increased openness and movement across borders have resulted in a recent revival of this tropical infectious disease, which is an imported epidemic to China \[[@pntd.0007350.ref006], [@pntd.0007350.ref007]\]."
"Approximately 94% of indigenous cases in mainland China were reported from Guangdong Province, and 83% of these cases were in Guangzhou City \[[@pntd.0007350.ref008]\], following an unprecedented dengue outbreak in Guangzhou in 2014 that has attracted the attention of relevant researchers."
"Both domestic and foreign scholars have carried out a considerable amount of research into DF epidemics, including into factors affecting the spread and prevalence of the disease and the corresponding prevention and control measures \[[@pntd.0007350.ref009]--[@pntd.0007350.ref013]\]."
"These studies have shown that the population, transportation, and living environment have undergone tremendous changes due to rapid urbanization, which in turn has led to changing DF transmission characteristics."
"In addition to some important natural environmental factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) \[[@pntd.0007350.ref009]--[@pntd.0007350.ref011]\], social and economic factors, such as population distribution and density, land urbanization level, and road network density will have an important impact on the temporal and spatial patterns of DF epidemics \[[@pntd.0007350.ref012], [@pntd.0007350.ref013]\]."
"Furthermore, the presence of infected people may accelerate the transmission of DF in regions with high population densities \[[@pntd.0007350.ref014], [@pntd.0007350.ref015]\]."
"Informal urban settlements in China are described as urban villages (UVs), unique areas of high population density."
"Urban space has undergone dramatic transformation and reconstruction during China's rapid urbanization, which has caused a large number of rural villages that were originally on the edge of the city to be gradually surrounded or semi-enclosed by urban land \[[@pntd.0007350.ref016]--[@pntd.0007350.ref020]\]."
"A lack of overall planning and scientific management of UVs has resulted in a large number of irregular buildings scattered in urban areas, with subsequent poor sanitation, lack of infrastructure and serious environmental pollution \[[@pntd.0007350.ref021], [@pntd.0007350.ref022]\]."
"These characteristics of UVs, combined with their perennial humidity and relatively low temperature \[[@pntd.0007350.ref023], [@pntd.0007350.ref024]\], provides an ideal living environment for the breeding of *Aedes albopictus*, the sole vector of dengue transmission in Guangzhou."
"However, the current quantitative relationship between UVs and DF epidemics has received very little attention."
"Moreover, different factors influencing the DF epidemic have a spatial scale effect."
"Most of the available research has been focused on analysis at a relatively large spatial scale, such as at regional and prefecture level \[[@pntd.0007350.ref025]--[@pntd.0007350.ref028]\], with a small number of studies gradually expanding to small scales, such as at county, township, and even community or regular grid scales \[[@pntd.0007350.ref029], [@pntd.0007350.ref030]\]."
"However, these small spatial scales are often the final nodes where prevention and control measures can produce practical effects, and more research into the factors influencing DF and its prevention is required at this scale."
"Therefore, this study was based on high-resolution remotely sensed imagery extraction of UVs in the central areas of Guangzhou, using epidemiological statistical methods and spatial analysis to further analyze the spatial relationship between UVs, public transportation, road density, population density, gross domestic product (GDP) and the DF epidemic according to a 1 km×1 km grid scale."
The aim was to provide effective guidance for relevant government departments making targeted prevention and control measures on the DF epidemics in urban regions with numerous UVs.
"Materials and methods {#sec005}
=====================

Study area {#sec006}
----------

The study area was located in the central areas of Guangzhou (113° 23\'--113° 36\'E, 23° 08\'--23° 14\'N) and included the four districts of Liwan, YueXiu, Haizhu, and Tianhe."
"The regional location is shown in [Fig 1](#pntd.0007350.g001){ref-type=""fig""}."
"The central area of the study was a highly urbanized area of Guangzhou, with an urbanization level of 100% and a total area of 279.63km^2^."
This area has a population of 5.24 million permanent residents according to the 2017 Guangzhou Statistical Yearbook and is also the economic center of Guangzhou.
"In 2017, the GDP of the central area reached US\$151.73 billion \[[@pntd.0007350.ref031]\]."
"The characteristics of its subtropical monsoon climate are obvious: warm and rainy, enough light and heat, an annual average temperature of 21--23°C, and an average annual precipitation of 1800 mm."
"These suitable natural and social environmental conditions are favorable to the growth of *Aedes albopictus* and to the transmission of DENV, making it a high-risk area for DF \[[@pntd.0007350.ref032]\]."
"In addition, Guangzhou, in particular the central area, has a large number of UVs due to rapid urbanization over the past decades \[[@pntd.0007350.ref033]\]."

Data collection and processing {#sec007}
------------------------------

DF is a notifiable disease in China which means that, once diagnosed, cases must be reported to the web-based National Notifiable Disease Reporting Information System (NIDRIS) within 24 h \[[@pntd.0007350.ref034]\]."
"The DF case information includes age, sex, address, and time of onset."
"The DF epidemic data for this study were obtained from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and included DF case data from 2012--2014 and from 2017."
"The targeted DF cases in our study included clinically diagnosed (based on clinical manifestations and epidemiologic exposure history) or laboratory-confirmed cases (""clinically diagnosed cases presenting with any of the following lab test results relating to DF: a 4-fold increase in specific IgG antibody titer, positive on a PCR test or viral isolation and identification test"")."
"The address information of the confirmed cases, after desensitization, was used in conjunction with geocoding (<http://www.gpsspg.com/xGeocoding/>) and coordinate deviation correction to produce case data for a spatial point layer using ArcGIS 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) software ([Fig 2A](#pntd.0007350.g002){ref-type=""fig""})."
"In 2014, DF cases in the Guangzhou region reached a peak, with a total of 36 344 cases reported, of which 18 350 were from the central area, accounting for 50.49% of the entire Guangzhou city."
"Moreover, the ratio of the total DF cases in 2012--2017 to the population in 2015 was calculated so as to indicate the DF incidence rates during the study period on the 1 km × 1 km grid scale."
!
"[Spatial distribution and temporal variations of different data.\
(A): DF cases in 2012\~2014 and 2017; (B): Spatial distribution of land use types, GDP and population density; (C): bus stations, subway stations and road network in 2017."
"](pntd.0007350.g002){#pntd.0007350.g002}

With consideration of the high degree of urbanization of the study area, land use types for 2012 and 2017 was divided into five categories: normal construction land (NCL), UV, water, vegetation and unused land."
"NCL and UVs are collectively referred to herein as construction land (CL) ([Fig 2B](#pntd.0007350.g002){ref-type=""fig""})."
A total of 206 sample points were randomly selected to verify the classification results for 2012 and 2017.
"The overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficients for 2012 and 2017 were 82.67%, 0.802 and 87.40%, 0.851, respectively."
"As far as the producer's and user's accuracy were concerned, the UVs in 2017 possessed slightly lower accuracies (87.8% and 87.8%) than those of water (88.2% and 93.8%), and roads (90.0% and 87.1%), although the omission and commission of UVs had been appropriately controlled by the texture selection procedure."
"In a word, the present extraction accuracy can meet the requirements for further analysis."
Detailed information about the retrieval of land-use types can be found in an earlier study \[[@pntd.0007350.ref024]\].
"The public transport system (bus stops, subway stations) greatly facilitates the travel of people living in the central area."
Population density and GDP data in 2015 were collected to indicate population and economic status.
"The public transport, population density, GDP and road network vector data in this study ([Fig 2B and 2C](#pntd.0007350.g002){ref-type=""fig""}) were all obtained from the Resources and Environment Science Data Center (RESDC, [http://www.resdc.cn](http://www.resdc.cn/))."
"Road density was generated from road network vector data, including all roads in the central region of Guangzhou (highways, national ways, county roads, town roads, etc."
"), and it was the ratio of the length of road in each unit (grid) to the corresponding unit's area."
"Spatial analysis of the DF epidemic {#sec008}
-----------------------------------

Spatial autocorrelation analyses are frequently utilized to explore the spatial patterns of incidence or mortality in terms of Moran's I with z-score and/or *p*-value because of their high statistical power \[[@pntd.0007350.ref035]--[@pntd.0007350.ref037]\]."
Moran's I is produced by standardizing spatial autocovariance by the data variance using a measure of the connectivity of the data \[[@pntd.0007350.ref038]\].
"Generally, Moran's I value ranges from −1 to 1 and a high positive Moran's I value with larger z-score and/or appropriate *p*-value represents a tendency towards clustering, which means that adjacent units have similar incidence rates, whereas a low negative value indicates a tendency towards dispersal, which means that units with high incidence rates lie next to units with low incidence rates."
"In addition, the choice of spatial scale is the basis of spatial analysis."
"In many studies of infectious disease epidemiology, basic geographic units such as districts or townships/streets are often disturbed by changing administrative divisions, and the creation of regular spatial grids can effectively avoid this phenomenon \[[@pntd.0007350.ref039]\]."
"With reference to our previous research work \[[@pntd.0007350.ref029], [@pntd.0007350.ref030], [@pntd.0007350.ref039]\], a spatial gridded unit of 1 km × 1 km was used as the spatial unit in this study, and we analyzed the spatial autocorrelation degree of the DF epidemic at this grid scale."
"Geographically weighted regression modeling {#sec009}
-------------------------------------------

In view of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of DF incidence rates, the DF epidemic may be affected by its potential influencing factors in different ways and to various degrees, which is appropriate to analyze using a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model."
"As an extension of the traditional multiple linear regression (i.e., ordinary least square, OLS), a GWR model embeds the attributes' spatial location into the regression parameter, yielding a local regression together with local estimates of regression coefficients\[[@pntd.0007350.ref040]\]."
"The local estimation of the parameters with GWR is expressed by Eq ([1](#pntd.0007350.e001){ref-type=""disp-formula""}) as below: $$\text{y}_{i} = \beta_{0}\left( {\text{u}_{i},\text{v}_{i}} \right) + {\sum_{k = 1}^{n}{\beta_{ik}\left( {\text{u}_{i},\text{v}_{i}} \right)\text{x}_{ik} + \varepsilon_{i}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (i = 1,\ 2,\ldots,\ \ \ \text{m)}}}$$ where *i* = 1, 2,..., m denotes the number of spatial units in the central area of Guangzhou; $y_{i}$ is the dependent variable (the DF incidence rates during 2012--2017) at location *i*; independent variable $x_{ik}$ is the value of the *k* parameter at location *i, $x_{ik}$* referred to the value of an affecting factor *k* (such as land use types, GDP, and so on) at spatial unit *i*, which is specific for every spatial unit; $\left( {u_{i},v_{i}} \right)$ is the position coordinate of the sample point; $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept; $\beta_{ik}$ is the correlation coefficient for the independent predictor variable $x_{ik}$, which is to be estimated; and $\varepsilon_{i}$ represents random error."
"During the GWR modeling, the most important parameter, named as bandwidth, that controls the degree of smoothing in the model was chosen by selecting the method of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc)."
"Then, every spatial unit has a set of specific parameters to reflect the relationship between dengue fever incidence rate and influencing factors."
"In particular, the variance inflation factor (VIF) had also been employed in this study to test the collinearity among these independent variables integrated in the models, since these selected explanatory variables likely correlated with each other."
"Finally, all the parameters derived from both GWR and OLS will be compared in terms of the values of AICc, Sigma (i.e, residual standard deviation), VIF, and adjusted R^2^, on which the performance of these models could be evaluated."
"At the same time, the spatial autocorrelation analysis on the standardized residual (StdResid) values of these models was further employed to evaluate the explanatory performances (e.g., spatial stability) of the OLS and GWR models."
"The Moran's I values close to zero indicated that there is no spatial autocorrelation of the StdResid values, and the results would be more reliable and then recommended for subsequent analysis."
"By means of the exploratory regression tool, twenty-five OLS and GWR models with higher Adjusted R^2^ and lower values of AICc, Sigma, and VIF were recommended."
"Integrating various combinations of influencing factors in the OLS/GWR models with the lowest AICc and Sigma, the highest adjusted R^2^, and lower VIF than 7.5, eleven univariate models and fourteen multivariate models were respectively conducted for the comparison between CL, UV/NCL, water, vegetation, public traffic, road density, population density and GDP grouped factors."
"In addition, we created a series of buffering zones with increasing radii based on the boundaries of the UVs, in which the incidence rates, the proportion of the DF cases, as well as its growth rates, in different years in each buffering zone were counted."
"Meanwhile, Pearson correlation analysis was applied to explore the relationships between DF incidences and all of the potential variables (UVs, population density, GDP, bus stops, subway stations, and road density) at the significance level of 0.05 and 0.01, by which some appropriate potential variables could be accordingly considered into the GWR models."
"All of the above spatial analysis and modeling were completed in ArcGIS 10.3 software (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA)."
"Typical correlation analysis was achieved using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)."
"Results {#sec010}
=======

Spatial distribution of UVs {#sec011}
---------------------------

Land-use types across the central region, including Liwan, Haizhu, Yuexiu, and Tianhe districts in Guangzhou City, typically featured impervious surfaces (i.e., NCL and UVs) according to their dominant area percentage (53.80% in 2012 and 58.12% in 2017) ([S1 Table](#pntd.0007350.s001){ref-type=""supplementary-material""})."
"Among these four central regions, in 2012, Haizhu District had the largest area of UV (10.91 km^2^) and Yuexiu, Liwan, and Tianhe districts had 7.98, 4.06, and 8.80 km^2^ of UV."
There were more than 450 UVs with areas varying from less than 0.001 km^2^ to 0.87 km^2^.
"As a result of urban renewal, the total area of UV decreased from 31.75 km^2^ (2012) to 31.38 km^2^ (2017), with a clear reduction in Liwan (about 0.12 km^2^ in Xinglongfang and Dongjiao communities) and Tianhe (0.25 km^2^ or so near Pingyun Square, the Second Xintang communities, and Xinxu communities) in particular, as shown in [Fig 3](#pntd.0007350.g003){ref-type=""fig""}."
"Since there were so fewer changes of UVs during 2012--2017, the data of land-use information in 2012 was chosen for subsequent analysis."
!
[Spatial distribution of UVs across the central districts in Guangzhou during 2012--2017.
"](pntd.0007350.g003){#pntd.0007350.g003}

In the region, the Pearl River fork zone across Yuexiu, Liwan, and Haizhu was the most typically spatially clustered with UVs."
Dongpu Town in Tianhe and the central zone of Haizhu were the other two representative zones.
"Unused land and water area decreased by 16.21 km^2^ and 1.95 km^2^, respectively, between 2012 and 2017, while vegetation and NCL increased by 4.03 km^2^ and 14.50 km^2^, respectively."
"In summary, the central area of Guangzhou City mainly featured impervious surfaces, especially many widely distributed UVs."
"Temporal and spatial distribution of the DF epidemic {#sec012}
----------------------------------------------------

There were a total of 20 059 local DF cases reported in the central districts, which accounted for half of the total cases in the whole Guangzhou City during the study period."
"Meanwhile, the distribution of DF was spatially different across this typical region."
"The ratio of DF cases in each infected unit to the mean value of all the infected units (RDM) varied spatially on the 1 km × 1 km scale (close to the largest UV area) in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2017."
"However, the units with high RDM were mainly located around the Pearl River fork between Yuexiu, Liwan, and Haizhu districts ([Fig 4](#pntd.0007350.g004){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Meanwhile, the DF epidemic during these four years was remarkably spatially clustered according to the spatial autocorrelation indices (0.174 \< Moran's I \< 0.673, 6.398 \< z-score \< 16.930, *p*-value \< 0.001; [S2 Table](#pntd.0007350.s002){ref-type=""supplementary-material""})."
These results obviously showed that the DF epidemic in the central region was spatially featured on the grid scale.

The aggregation effect of UVs on the DF epidemic {#sec013}
------------------------------------------------

Between 2012 and 2017, DF patterns in the UVs differed from those of the NCL areas."
"As shown in [Table 1](#pntd.0007350.t001){ref-type=""table""}, 61.76%-- 71.45% of total DF cases in the CL zones were distributed in the NCL zones with proportionally larger areas (81.93% in 2012 and 83.47% in 2017) across the central four districts."
"By comparison, the rest (28.55%-- 38.24%) were distributed in UVs with proportionally smaller areas (18.07% in 2012 and 16.53% in 2017)."
"Meanwhile, population density (persons per km^2^) in the UVs was slightly higher than that of NCL in 2012 and 2017, although the population size of NCL is 4.55--4.94 times that of the UVs."
"As a result, the density of DF cases and the DF incidence rates in UVs were respectively 1.81--3.13 and 1.82--3.06 times that of NCL between 2012 and 2017."
"It can be clearly seen that UVs possessed higher values of DF cases density, incidence rates, and population density in the central region of Guangzhou City."
"In other words, DF cases were more likely to be found in UV areas."

"In addition, the regions surrounding UVs were obviously influenced by the DF epidemic in the UVs with DF cases."
"Along with the radius of buffers increasing, accumulated DF case count in regions including the UVs with DF cases and their surrounding buffering zones showed an ascending trend ([Fig 5](#pntd.0007350.g005){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Until the radius of the buffer zones was 500m, about 90% of the total DF cases were concentrated in these regions (i.e., UVs and buffer zones)."
"In comparison, newly included DF cases in the extended buffers per 50 m (i.e., increasing slope) displayed clear decreasing trends, especially in the first two buffers (50 m and 100 m)."
This decline was alleviated in the 200 m buffers.
"Meanwhile, the incidence rates of DF in the buffering zones gradually decreased, although there was larger and larger population proportion due to the increasing buffering distances."
These results illustrated that UVs posed an obvious aggregation effect on the DF epidemic across the central region in Guangzhou City.

Effects of transportation and UV area on the DF epidemic {#sec014}
--------------------------------------------------------

Advanced traffic conditions, especially public transportation systems (such as bus services and subway lines) facilitate contact among people living in UVs."
DF case density in the units (n = 272) with either bus stops or subway stations was much higher (73.21 cases per km^2^) than those without any bus stops or subway stations (7.74 cases per km^2^) (n = 19).
"Moreover, as given in [Table 2](#pntd.0007350.t002){ref-type=""table""}, the gridded DF incidence rates were significantly positively associated with UV area (*r* = 0.33, P = 0.000), number of bus stops (*r* = 0.49, P = 0.000) and subway stations (*r* = 0.27, P = 0.000), and road density (*r* = 0.39, P = 0.000)."
"In comparison, the partial correlation coefficient between the gridded DF incidence rates and UV area individually decreased from 0.33 to 0.24 when traffic conditions were controlled for ([Table 2](#pntd.0007350.t002){ref-type=""table""})."
"These partial correlation coefficients between DF incidence rates and traffic conditions (i.e., the number of bus stops, subway stations, all stops, and road density) were slightly decreased to 0.43, 0.27, 0.41, and 0.38, respectively, when UV area was controlled for."
"Among them, bus stops were the most suitable indicator of traffic conditions because of their high correlation coefficients."
"These results indicated that the aggregation effects on the gridded DF epidemic across the central region were heavily influenced by the traffic system, especially the presence of bus stops."
"Spatial modeling of DF epidemics {#sec015}
--------------------------------

According to the adjusted R^2^, AICc and Sigma values ([Table 3](#pntd.0007350.t003){ref-type=""table""}), spatial variations in the gridded DF epidemic in the central region of Guangzhou City were appropriately explained by the GWR/OLS models, which employed each influencing factor or their various combinations."
"In comparison, the comprehensive explanatory performance of the GWR models was much better than that of the OLS models due to the higher adjusted R^2^, lower AICc and Sigma values."
About 46% or more spatial variation was interpreted by the univariate GWR models.
"Among the potential influencing factors derived from the univariate GWR models, bus stops and UVs possessed relatively higher adjusted R^2^, lower Sigma and AICc values."
"However, population density possessed a relatively lower adjusted R^2^, higher Sigma and AICc values."

"Similarly, the GWR model (Com 1) integrating bus stops and UVs performed the best among all of the bivariate models."
"When this model further integrated either GDP or population density that possessed relatively weaker explanatory ability, the performances were increased according to the rising adjusted R^2^ and declining values of AICc and Sigma in the GWR models (Com 9 and Com 10 in [Table 3](#pntd.0007350.t003){ref-type=""table""})."

"In particular, the weakest performance was observed in the model (Com 12) even though the best bivariate GWR model (Com 1) further integrated both GDP and population density."
"And the reliability of its results quickly decayed because the potential risk of collinearity (VIF) had increased from 1.23 to 4.82 ([Table 3](#pntd.0007350.t003){ref-type=""table""})."

"Moreover, according to the spatially random patterns of the StdResid values (Moran's I = 0.04, *p* = 0.26, Z-score = 1.12), the performance of this model was also spatially stable, although there were still a few units with absolute StdResid values \> 2 ([Fig 6](#pntd.0007350.g006){ref-type=""fig""})."

In terms of the influence of the three variables (GDP, UVs, and bus stops) on the spatial variation of DF infection, these variables were spatially differentiated across the central region ([Fig 6](#pntd.0007350.g006){ref-type=""fig""})."
"The presence of bus stops was positively associated with the DF epidemics in most of the units, especially the Liwan district."
The influences of GDP displayed spatial disparities.
"They were positive effect in most areas of Tianhe and Haizhu districts and negative effect in Liwan, Yuexiu, and near the Pearl River fork of Haizhu district."
"In comparison, UVs tended to have a greater association with DF, with more units with relative higher local coefficient values in Liwan, Yuexiu, Haizhu, and Tianhe districts, although the association tended to be weaker (less than 200) in the central Haizhu where there were relatively fewer DF cases ([Fig 4](#pntd.0007350.g004){ref-type=""fig""}), lower road density, less population density, and sparser public transportation stations ([Fig 2](#pntd.0007350.g002){ref-type=""fig""})."
These results suggested that UVs were the most important factor in the spatial variations in the DF epidemic across the central region of Guangzhou.
"Discussion {#sec016}
==========

Widely distributed urban settlements and serious DF epidemics are two major public concerns in Guangzhou City."
"In this study, we analyzed the spatial and quantitative relationship between the DF epidemic and UVs on a grid scale across the central region of Guangzhou."
The interesting findings provide valuable clues to enable local environmental health authorities in targeted interventions in the prevention of this epidemic.
"The size and spatial heterogeneity of the DF epidemics were probably associated with numerous UVs widely distributed across the study region with developed public transportation (e.g., many bus stops), good economic status, and a dense population."
"Previous studies across the entire joint Guangzhou-Foshan (GF) area have found that spatially clustered DF cases in this region are associated with its higher land urbanization level, population size, road density, and economic level (GDP per capita) \[[@pntd.0007350.ref030], [@pntd.0007350.ref041]\]."
Our study found that this central region typically featured by not only impervious surfaces (including NCL and UVs) but also spatially differentiated DF epidemics on the 1 km × 1 km grid scale.
"Meanwhile, there was higher density of DF cases and incidence rates in UV areas than in NCL areas, and the DF epidemic was significantly positively associated with UVs' acreage both at the grid scale and the UV level."
There are two possible reasons for this.
"First, UVs, as a type of informal urban settlement, provide *Aedes albopictus* mosquitoes with a suitable environment for survival and breeding, featuring slightly lower land surface temperature than NCL areas \[[@pntd.0007350.ref024]\], especially in the summer months."
"Second, the denser population in UVs and its flowing traits were two core impetuses of UVs' influences on the DF epidemic."
"In particular, UVs have a high density of low-cost accommodation rented by migrant workers from local house owners, which provided local citizens with a steady source of revenue and resulted in a large floating population \[[@pntd.0007350.ref021], [@pntd.0007350.ref042]\]."
"This increases the probability of being bitten by mosquito vectors, causing rapid transmission of this disease."
"DF is also more frequent within a specific 200--300 m radius around UVs, which is probably determined by the mosquitoes' maximum flying range of approximately 300 m \[[@pntd.0007350.ref043], [@pntd.0007350.ref044]\]."
"Thus, it can be seen that widely distributed UVs have an important influence on the DF epidemic, not only within the specific UV areas but also within their surrounding zones, crucially associated with the severity and obvious spatial disparities in DF incidence across the central region in Guangzhou City."
We cautiously suggest that both UVs and their surrounding zones should receive considerable focus during DF epidemics.
"A convenient public traffic system meets the commuting demands of local residents, including the floating population who reside in UVs but work outside of them."
"Earlier studies reported that traffic conditions impose important effects on DF transmission \[[@pntd.0007350.ref013], [@pntd.0007350.ref041], [@pntd.0007350.ref045]\], similar to our findings that public transportation (the presence of bus stops in particular) was not only directly associated with the DF incidence rates on the grid scale, but also influenced the aggregation effect of UVs on the DF epidemic, especially in zones with numerous UVs."
We cautiously speculate that DF cases in infected UVs or units (grids) may have been potential infection sources when they entered other zones via the public traffic system.
"In other words, these UVs or units/grids with infections presence likely acted as transfer stations (receiving and/or exporting DF cases) during DF transmission."
"In a sense, it can be supposed to some degree that the infected cases/patients would also act as the disease's vector, since local residents are the other crucial element in the DF transmission and the flying distance of mosquitoes (*Aedes albopictus*) is far less than human mobility due to developed public transportation."
"Accordingly, we recommend that targeted and effective interventions should be implemented in zones with numerous UVs and public traffic stations across the central region in Guangzhou City during the DF epidemic."
Use of generalized additive models has revealed that associations between DF infection and GDP were nonlinear at the township level across the Pearl River Delta \[[@pntd.0007350.ref013]\].
Our earlier investigation found that GDP had a weak but spatially differentiated correlation with DF infection across the GF area \[[@pntd.0007350.ref029]\].
"We found similar in this study, employing GWR models at a fine spatial scale (1 km × 1 km) and taking three spatially differentiated variables (UVs and bus stops as special influencing factors, as well as GDP) into consideration."
"GDP had a clear protective effect in the west zones (including in Liwan, most of Yuexiu, and west Haizhu) where there were more serious DF epidemics and larger areas of UV."
"This effect is likely related to the UVs in these areas being surrounded by NCL, with a higher economic status and the better promotion of public health services (e.g., education and publicity about hygiene) in these well-developed zones."
"On the contrary, GDP tended to be a risk factor for DF transmission in the east zones (i.e., most of Tianhe and northeast Haizhu) where there were relatively small DF outbreaks and many construction sites (categorized as unused land in this study), especially in the district of Tianhe, which is experiencing rapid economic development and urban construction."
"However, whether the positive correlation between GDP and DF incidence rates was related to the wide distribution of unused land needs further investigation."
"Nevertheless, our findings are sufficiently reasonable and detailed to infer that the influence of economic status on DF transmission was spatially differentiated."
We advise that the protective influences of GDP on DF infection in Liwan and Yuexiu districts are further investigated to explore how its protective effects can be expanded to Tianhe and Haizhu districts with their growing economies.
There were some limitations to the study.
"First, many more important influential factors should be further explored and included in the GWR models to interpret much more spatial variation in the DF epidemic, since less than 60% was explained at present."
"In particular, an appropriate variable should be acquired to comprehensively reflect both public transportation and population density so as to further interpret the remained (40% or so) spatial variation in the current study."
"For this point, data derived from mobile devices, metro cards and/or bus cards could be used to capture information about mode of travel and the movement of local residents, both for confirmed and suspected DF cases."
"This is particularly relevant to the UVs, as the effects of the public transportation system and UVs on DF transmission could be further investigated and high intercept values ([Fig 6](#pntd.0007350.g006){ref-type=""fig""}) decreased."
"Second, reliable monitoring data on the vectors' population or density in the study area should be continuously collected and then used fully for a further comprehensive analysis of the link between DF epidemic and all the influencing factors in the future."
"Finally, the time series of the DF case data and the spatiotemporally matched remote sensing images should be longer."
"This would enable better validation of the typical influence of UVs, as DF epidemics have periodically occurred in the central region of Guangzhou City, with rapid land urbanization, since the 2000s."

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in pulmonary arterial hypertension.
"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) provides accurate information about right ventricular (RV) mass, RV volumes and other markers of RV function."
"CMRI is proving to be a particularly useful tool in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as measures of RV function have been shown to be prognostic of long-term outcomes in this disease."
Changes in RV function can also provide important information about a patient's disease course and response to treatment.
"As CMRI is noninvasive it can be used to regularly monitor patients with PAH, which is an important advantage over invasive right heart catheterisation."
This review will explore the use of CMRI in the context of existing monitoring tools for PAH and will explore the forthcoming developments that are likely to be important in the future monitoring of patients with PAH.
"A viral Facebook Live video shows a man being violently arrested in Euclid, Ohio."
"A live-streamed video that was making its way around Facebook on August 12th (2017) shows a man being violently arrested in Euclid, OH."
"(Note: many of the people sharing the video had for some reason misidentified the location as Edina, MN.)"
"As of right now, there aren’t a lot of details outside of what can be seen on the video."
(That video is embedded below.)
"Later in the evening, the Euclid Police Department did release a statement in which they said that the cops pulled a man named Richard Hubbard III, who is from Cleveland, over for a traffic violation."
They then decided to arrest him for some unspecified reason.
Euclid is a suburb of Cleveland.
"According to the EPD statement, Hubbard refused to turn around and face away from them when the police officers ordered him to."
"Initially, there are two cops involved in the beating."
"Eventually, at least three other cops arrive and begin helping handcuff Hubbard."
"The cop, that can be seen hitting Hubbard numerous times, including in the back of his head, has not been identified yet."
"Currently, he is on paid vacation while his co-workers perform an “investigation.”

A woman who can be seen recording with her cell phone apparently was arrested also once the other cops arrived."
"Below, is the statement from the Euclid police, via Fox8.com in Cleveland:

Euclid police released a statement about the incident, saying that just before 10:30 a.m., an officer pulled over Richard Hubbard, 25, of Cleveland, for a moving/traffic violation near 240 East 228th Street."
Hubbard was ordered out of the car told to face away from the police as he was taken into custody.
Police say that Hubbard ignored that order and began to physically resist as the officer took him into custody.
"The violent struggle, pictured below, lasted for over 3 minutes."
"Update: Partial dash cam video (also embedded below) has been released, which is included as an update to the previously cited Fox8.com post."
"However, it’s still not very clear even on that video why the police saw Hubbard as a threat when they initially decided to arrest him."
"According to the new statement from police, Hubbard was being arrested for not having a license."
"In addition, although it isn’t shown on either video, the statement says that Hubbard was tased."
(The taser can be seen being thrown onto the street after it apparently wasn’t effective.)
"They also state that they thought he was going to run, but he appears to be boxed in between the car, the open car door, and the officer who would later assault him."
"It doesn’t seem like he would have much of an opportunity to run, even if that was his intention."
New phenoxazinone-related alkaloids from strain Streptomyces sp.
KIB-H1318.
Chemical investigation of a strain Streptomyces sp.
"KIB-H1318 isolated from soil sample led to the discovery of three new phenoxazinone-related alkaloids 1-3, as well as two known analogs exfoliazone (4) and viridobrunnine A (5)."
Their structures were determined on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis.
The antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the isolates were assayed.
"Exfoliazone and viridobrunnine A exhibited minor antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 8099, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538."
"Compound 2 exhibited low cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines HeLa and SW480 with the IC50 values of 36.8 and 37.8 μM, respectively."

"ILLEGAL INITIATION SCHOOLS CAUSING MORE DEATHS

Parents are advised to look out for illegal initiation schools after an increasing number of boys dying at several initiation schools."
Deputy Traditional Affairs Minister Obed Bapela said that it was important for parents and children to talk about joining initiation because children run to illegal schools without their parent’s permission.
The deputy minister added that illegal schools don’t take the boys to doctors to test them for life threatening diseases like diabetes.
"“Two boys in Verena died because of diabetes and pneumonia, something that might have been prevented if they were taken to the doctor before,” said Bapela."
"President of the Congress of Traditional Leaders in South Africa, Setlamorago Thobejane said that illegal initiation schools were looking for fast cash and didn’t have the boys’ best interests."
"Illegal initiations schools allow children as young as 13-year-old, and according to Bapela the law only allows a 16-year-old to go for initiation."
"“The purpose of initiation is to prepare boys for adulthood, how can a 13-year-old be prepared for adulthood?” questioned Bapela."
But Thobejane disagreed saying that aged differed according to areas.
"“Some areas in the Free State allowed 13 year olds.”

Thobejane added that age was not the problem but people who own illegal initiation schools."
Police are in search of the owner of the illegal school in Verena where two boys died of diabetes and pneumonia.
"Background {#Sec1}
==========

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a pregnancy implanted outside the intrauterine cavity with over 98 % occurring within the Fallopian tube \[[@CR1]\]."
The prevalence of EP has been estimated to be 1-2 % of all natural pregnancies worldwide and in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) it ranges between 0.58-1.5 % \[[@CR2]--[@CR5]\].
"Tubal EP is the main cause of maternal mortality and morbidity during the first trimester and death secondary to EP represents 5 % and 10 % of all maternal deaths in developed and developing countries, respectively \[[@CR6]\]."
"Several risk factors for the development of EP have been identified and a history of STI, tubal factor infertility (TFI) and/or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is particularly important and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of EP \[[@CR7]--[@CR9]\]."
"Damage to the lower and upper genital tracts can occur following bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infection \[[@CR10], [@CR11]\]."
PID refers to infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract (e.g.
salpingitis and endometritis) in women and it leads to serious reproductive sequelae including infertility and EP \[[@CR12]--[@CR14]\].
"A variety of pathogens have been identified in the aetiology of PID including *Chlamydia trachomatis* (CT), *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (NG), *Mycoplasma genitalium* (MG), *Ureaplasma urealyticum* (Uurea), *Ureaplasma parvum* (Uparv), *Gardnerella vaginalis* (GV), *Trichomonas vaginalis* (TV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 & 2 \[[@CR12]--[@CR14]\]."
STIs are major health problem and the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 100 million persons acquire STIs every year and that 26 million people are infected in the Middle East \[[@CR15]\].
Data on the frequency of STIs in Islamic countries is markedly limited and in KSA there has been no implementation of national guidelines and/or screening program to monitor the rate of STIs despite the recent findings of several studies from the kingdom \[[@CR16]--[@CR23]\].
"Furthermore, the majority of these reports focused mainly on the prevalence of CT and NG and none of them measured the rate of other STIs and few were conducted on EP."
"Several methods are available for detecting the aforementioned microorganisms in clinical specimens including culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \[[@CR24]\]."
"PCR has advantages over the other standard methods with respect to rapidity, sensitivity and specificity \[[@CR24]\]."
"However, the microbiological aetiology of STIs involves multiple pathogens and therefore, multiplex PCR provides an additional advantage in screening since it detects multiple pathogens simultaneously in a single clinical sample with high sensitivity and specificity \[[@CR25]\]."
"We hypothesise that STIs, similar to other societies, represent a significant risk factor for the development of EP in KSA."
"The current study was therefore designed to measure the prevalence of *C. trachomatis*, *N. gonorrhoeae*, *M. genitalium*, *U. urealyticum/parvum*, *G. vaginalis*, *T. vaginalis* and HSV-1/2 by multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR in Fallopian tube tissue samples collected from Saudi females diagnosed with EP and the results were compared with those obtained from women who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) or tubal ligation (TL)."
The findings of this study may provide a better reflection on the role of STIs in the pathogenesis of EP and may possibly support the development of appropriate policies regarding screening and treatment of STIs especially for the healthcare policy makers in the kingdom.

Ethical approval {#Sec3}
----------------

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Umm Al-Qura university and Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences (AMSEC 10-15-9-2011)."
All tubal samples were collected following obtaining informed written consent from all the participants.
"Study design {#Sec4}
------------

This was a prospective case--control study."
Fallopian tube specimens were collected from 84 women diagnosed with tubal EP and they served as 'Case group'.
"For the 'Control group', tubal specimens were collected from 31 patients during tubal ligation and 20 patients following total abdominal hysterectomy."
"The inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarised in Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}."
"The study measured the frequency of *C. trachomatis*, *N. gonorrhoeae*, *M. genitalium*, *U. urealyticum/parvum*, *G. vaginalis*, *T. vaginalis* and HSV-1/2 by multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR in all samples and the results were compared between the case and control groups.Table 1Principle inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study groupsControl groupCase groupInclusion criteriaExclusion criteriaInclusion criteriaExclusion criteriaSaudiNon-SaudiSaudiNon-SaudiPatient age ≥ 18 and ≤ 42 years.Patient age \< 18 or \> 42 years.Patient age ≥ 18 and \< 40 years.Patient age \< 18 or \> 40 years.Cyclic women with a history of previous intrauterine pregnancy and no history of hydrosalpinx or ectopic pregnancyWomen with abnormal menstrual cycle, history of infertility treatment, history of PID, endometriosis and previous ectopic pregnancy.Ectopic pregnancy following spontaneous conceptionEctopic pregnancy following assisted conception, using IUD, History/symptoms of urogenital infection (e.g."

Study groups {#Sec5}
------------

A total of 135 participants were recruited from the Maternity and Children Hospital in Makkah (MH-M), Maternity hospital in Jeddah (MH-J) and Althager General Hospital in Jeddah (AH-J), KSA between January 2012 and February 2015.Ectopic pregnancy group (EP)Fallopian tube samples were collected from 84 women (mean age 32.7 ± 7.5 years) who attended the Emergency Department and/or the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit with complaints of vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain during the first trimester of pregnancy."
The diagnosis of EP was made either by transvaginal ultrasound or laparoscopy and salpingectomy was performed on clinical management grounds.
"The total numbers of patients recruited in this group from each centre during the 3 years of the study were 30 from the Maternity Hospital in Makkah (MH-M), 36 women from MH-J and 18 women form AH-J."
"Details of patient recruitment per year from each centre are summarised in Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type=""table""}.Table 2Details of recruitment of the 135 study participants according to study groups and study centres during the 3 years period of the studyMaternity Hospital-MakkahMaternity Hospital-JeddahAlthagar General Hospital-Jeddah*Year 1Year 2Year 3TotalYear 1Year 2Year 3TotalYear 1Year 2Year 3TotalEctopic pregnancy (n = 84)*1011930716133658518*Total Abdominal Hysterectomy ( n = 20)*4331032490101*Tubal Ligation (n = 31)*55313454132305*Total (n = 135)*1919155314232158712524Control groupA set of 40 Fallopian tubes were obtained from 20 cycling women (mean age 37.2 ± 5.1 years) who were undergoing routine total abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease not affecting the Fallopian tubes."
"All women had regular menstrual cycles, were of proven fertility with no evidence of tubal disease and were not taking exogenous hormones (Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type=""table""})."
"Another set of 62 tubal specimens were collected from 31 fertile women (mean age 36.1 ± 4.5 years) during tubal ligation for sterilisation at the time of caesarean section (Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type=""table""})."
The collected tubes from both TAH and TL groups served as controls.
"Sampling and processing {#Sec6}
-----------------------

All specimens were collected and processed under sterilised conditions."
"For the case group, the Fallopian tubes were excised and 1 cm from the implantation site was removed for routine histological analysis of the ectopic pregnancy."
The remaining portions of the collected tubes were immediately cut using RNase/DNase-free equipment (baked at 200 °C for 4 h) into small pieces of 1 cm each.
"These samples were then transferred in 10 ml of sterile RNA*Later* solution (Ambion, Warrington, UK) for preservation."
All the tissues were stored at −80 °C until processed for DNA extraction.
"DNA was extracted from a random piece from each tubal specimen using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and following homogenisation using electrical homogeniser and sterile plastic probes (Omni International, GA, USA)."
"The quality and quantity of extracted DNA were assessed with the BioSpec-nano (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and typically had an A260/A280 ratio of 1.7 to 1.9."
Extracted DNA from all tubes were diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/μl and aliquots of the diluted samples were stored at −20 °C until used.
Detection of human genomic DNA was performed by PCR using primers PCO3 and PCO6 specific for the human β-globin gene as previously described \[[@CR26]\].
The expected PCR product of 326 bp was visualised on a 0.8 % agarose gel after ethidium bromide staining.
"Multiplex-PCR for 7 sexually transmitted pathogens in tubal tissues {#Sec7}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplex PCR amplification was performed on ABI® 7500 platform from Applied Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warrington, UK) and using the FTD STD9 kit (Fast-track diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxembourg) according to the manufacturer\'s protocol."
"The kit is IVD CE certified and contained sets of primers and TaqMan probes that were specifically designed from highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for the 7 pathogens (*C. trachomatis*, *N. gonorrhoeae*, *M. genitalium*, *U. urealyticum/parvum*, *G. vaginalis*, *T. vaginalis* and HSV-1/2)."
"However, the kit does not distinguish either between the 2 *Ureaplasma* biovars or the HSV genotypes."
"As reported by the manufacturer, the kit has a detection limit of 10^3^ copies/ml for all pathogens except TV and GV, which could be detected until 10^2^ copies/ml, and HSV1 that only could be measured until 10^4^ copies/ml."
The analytical sensitivity of the kit also showed no loss of sensitivity of the FTD STD9 kit compared with singleplex assays as reported in the manufacturer validation document.
"The FTD STD9 kit included murine cytomegalovirus as internal control and it was added to each Fallopian tubal sample at the lysis buffer stage of the extraction process, and co-amplified with the target DNA from all clinical samples to assure that the isolation of nucleic acid was successful and the absence of PCR inhibitors."
The validation of the results was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and by using the provided positive and negative controls within the kit.
"Each well of the PCR plate contained 12.5 μl mastermix, 1 μl enzyme, 1.5 μl of primers and 10 μl (500 ng) DNA."
"The amplification was performed under the following conditions: 42 °C for 15 minutes hold, 94 °C for 3 minutes hold and 40 cycles (94 °C for 8 seconds and 60 °C for 34 seconds)."
"For those samples that were positive for NG, the results were validated by the FTD Gonorrhoeae confirmation kit (Fast-track diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxembourg) to confirm the results as per the manufacturer's instructions and as previously described \[[@CR27]\]."
"Since the kit is designed to be used with swab samples, culture, urine and thin prep samples and not with whole tissue, we performed an extra validation step for all samples that were negative to confirm the results."
"This step consisted of spiking the negative samples with the provided positive DNA controls at 4:1 ratio for a sample (8 μl) and positive control (2 μl), respectively."
A detection of a signal following this step was reassuring that the designated organisms were not present in the original negative samples.
The determination of the gene copies/ml for each microorganism was carried out according the provided formula by the manufacturer that was based on the amplification dynamics of positive control dilution series with a linear relationship between log10 gene copy numbers and Ct values.
"Statistical analysis {#Sec8}
--------------------

Statistical analysis of the results was performed using SPSS version 16."
"Cross-tabulation followed by Chi square (X^2^) test or Fischer's exact test were used for frequency analysis as appropriate, and a crude odds ratio (COR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated."
Binary regression was applied to measure the odds ratio (OR) and CI of each microorganism and single/multiple infection on the development of EP.
All tests performed were two-sided and *P* value \< 0.05 was considered significant.
"Results {#Sec9}
=======

Subject characteristics {#Sec10}
-----------------------

Between January 2012 and February 2015 a total of 135 women were recruited from 3 centres: 2 in Jeddah and the third from Makkah."
"The patients were 84 (62.23 %) women diagnosed with tubal ectopic pregnancy and who underwent salpingectomy, 20 women (14.81 %) who underwent routine total abdominal hysterectomy for benign diseases not affecting the tubes/endometrium and 31 patients (22.96 %) who had tubal ligation for sterilisation."
"For the EP group, 35.7 % of cases (n = 30) were recruited from Makkah and the remaining 64.3 % (n = 54) were from Jeddah city."
The cases of TAH were equally distributed between both cities (n = 10/city).
"On the other hand, 41.9 % (n = 13) of TL cases were recruited from Makkah and the remainder (n = 18) were from Jeddah."
"Details of the numbers of recruited patients from each study centre are summarised in Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type=""table""}."
There was a significant difference in the age of the case group (mean age 32.7 ± 7.5 years; range 26--38 years) when compared with the TAH group (mean age 37.2 ± 5.1 years; range 34--42 years) (*P* \< 0.05).
"However, no significant difference was detected between TL group (mean age 36.1 ± 4.5 years; range 33--41 years) either with EP or TAH groups."
"Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the age between EP and control (TAH + TL; n = 51; *P* = 0.1)."
"Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections {#Sec11}
---------------------------------------------

### A."
"Overall prevalence {#Sec12}

The M-PCR assay clearly distinguished and identified all seven STIs in tubal samples from the case and control groups either as single or co-infections."
Signals were also detected in all wells that included the provided positive controls.
"Furthermore, no signal was observed with the negative controls."
Spiked negative tubal samples with the provided DNA of the pathogens of interest also showed a positive signal reassuring the observed results of this study.
The overall prevalence of detecting the microorganisms of interest either as single or co-infections in the 135 study participants was 31.85 % (n = 43).
"By further analysis, the rates in descending order were 19.3 % (n = 26) for *C. trachomatis*, 15.6 % (n = 21) for HSV-1/2, 14.1 % (n = 19) for *M. genitalium*, 9.6 % (n = 13) *U. urealyticum/parvum*, 5.2 % (n = 7) *G. vaginalis*, 4.44 % (n = 6) for *N. gonorrhoeae* and 2.96 % (n = 4) for *T. vaginalis*."
"The frequencies of single infection and co-infections in the 135 study participants were 11.1 % (n = 15) and 20.7 % (n = 28), respectively."
"The latter group included 15 patients positive for 2 pathogens (53.6 %), 10 patients positive for 3 pathogens (35.7 %) and 3 patients positive for the 7 pathogens (10.7 %)."

There was a significant difference between ectopic and control groups in the frequencies of *C. trachomatis* (COR 6.03; 95 % CI: 3.8-21.3; *P* = 0.001); *M. genitalium* (COR 6.2; 95 % CI: 2.3-18.1; *P* = 0.009) and HSV-1/2 (COR 4.3; 95 % CI: 2.2 -- 15.6 %; *P* = 0.01)."
No significant difference was observed in the rates of the other microorganisms between the two groups (*P* \> 0.05).
The presence of an infection (single/co-infection) was associated with a greater risk (COR 4.71; 95 % CI: 1.9 -- 9.6; *P* = 0.0001) of developing EP.
The rates of single infection (15.5 % vs. 3.9 %; COR 4.48; 95 % CI: 2.4 -- 10.7; *P* = 0.02) and co-infections (27.4 % vs. 9.8 %; COR 3.5; 95 % CI: 1.22 -- 8.8; *P* = 0.01) were significantly higher in EP group compared with control.
"Nevertheless, *N. gonorrhoeae*, *G. vaginalis* and *T. vaginalis* were not detected as a single infection in both the case and control groups (Table [3](#Tab3){ref-type=""table""})."
"Furthermore, *M. genitalium* and HSV-1/2 were only detected as mono-infection in the ectopic group."
"By comparing between Makkah (single centre) and Jeddah (2 centres) cities, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of the candidate pathogens between the two cities except for *G. vaginalis*, which showed a significantly higher rates in those patients with EP and recruited from Makkah (Table [4](#Tab4){ref-type=""table""})."
"Additionally the frequencies of *C. trachomatis*, *M. genitalium* and HSV-1/2 were significantly higher in the EP group compared with control in both cities."
"Additionally, the rates of detecting each organism of interest did not vary significantly during the 3 years of the study period (data not shown)."
"Although the results of copies/ml for the organisms of interest were higher in the EP group compared with control, we were not able to compute statistical analysis since the numbers of positive cases in the control group were very small (Table [5](#Tab5){ref-type=""table""}).Table 4Distribution of positive cases of *C. trachomatis* (CT), *N. gonorrhoeae* (NG), *M. genitalium* (MG), *U. urealyticum/parvum* (U.

"However, neither the other microorganisms nor the age of patients increased the risk of EP (data not shown)."
"Discussion {#Sec14}
==========

Herein, we measured the prevalence of 7 sexually transmitted organisms (*C. trachomatis*, *N. gonorrhoeae*, *M. genitalium*, *U. urealyticum/parvum*, *G. vaginalis*, *T. vaginalis* and HSV-1/2) detected simultaneously by multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR in Fallopian tubal specimens collected from 84 Saudi women diagnosed with EP and the results were compared with 51 control tubes obtained from 20 total abdominal hysterectomies and 31 tubal ligations."
The prevalence of co-infections was significantly higher compared with single infection in the study participants and it was associated with 5 times greater risk of developing EP.
"The most prevalent microorganisms detected in EP were *C. trachomatis, M. genitalium* and HSV-1/2 and they were also associated with higher risks of EP."
"Although the rates of the other pathogens were also higher in the EP group, they were not statistically different between the case and control groups."
"Our results suggest that STIs are common in Saudi Arabia and infections with *C. trachomatis, M. genitalium* and HSV-1/2 are more frequent in Saudi women suffering from ectopic pregnancy."
"Furthermore, the majority of positive cases in the present study (20.7 %) were positive for 2 or more sexually transmitted organisms and multiple infections with ≥ 2 pathogens increased the risk of EP and hence the use of multiplex PCR for the screening of STIs could be useful, especially for patients with tubal damage."
STI is a worldwide health problem and the WHO has estimated that 26 million people are infected in the Middle East \[[@CR15]\].
Upper genital tract infection with sexually transmitted pathogens is a major risk factor for the development of PID and EP.
"An estimated 10 %--20 % of women with STI could develop PID if their infection was not identified \[[@CR28]\], and a history of PID is associated with a 7.5 times greater risk of developing EP following either natural or assisted conception \[[@CR29]--[@CR31]\]."
"Reports from KSA have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of patients (up to 50 %) diagnosed with EP had a history of PID and/or infertility \[[@CR4], [@CR32]--[@CR34]\]."
"Nevertheless, none of the aforementioned studies examined the types and rates of sexually transmitted organisms in specimens collected from EP \[[@CR5]\]."
*C. trachomatis* is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection worldwide and it has been estimated that 30 % of women will develop PID and tubal damage following infection with CT \[[@CR35]--[@CR38]\].
Several other non-chlamydial/non-gonococcal microorganisms have also been detected and isolated from infected upper genital tract tissue specimens and implicated in the pathogenesis of EP.
"*M. genitalium* has been associated with non-chlamydial/non-gonococcal urethritis, cervicitis as well as endometritis, PID and tubal factor infertility in women \[[@CR39]--[@CR42]\]."
"Additionally, HSV-1/2 are common sexually transmitted viruses and they have been isolated from tissue specimens collected from female upper genital tract \[[@CR43]--[@CR48]\]."
"Infection with HSV has also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of EP \[[@CR49], [@CR50]\], and has been reported to increase the risk of acquiring common STIs \[[@CR51], [@CR52]\]."
"Our results are in agreement with the previous reports as they showed a higher significant rates of *C. trachomatis*, *M. genitalium* and HSV-1/2 in specimens obtained from EP."
"Additionally, positive cases for these microorganisms showed co-infection with other STIs organisms, supporting the notion that tubal damage and development of EP could be induced by a variety of sexually transmitted pathogens alongside with *C. trachomatis*."
"Our findings also suggest that infection with *C. trachomatis*, *M. genitalium* and HSV-1/2 frequently colonise the female upper genital tract and could play a more important role in the pathogenesis of EP in KSA."
"However, the used kit in the present study could not discriminate between type 1 and 2 HSV and hence further studies using specific primers for the differentiation between the 2 types of HSV are needed to measure their rates in tubal tissue collected from EP."
"Furthermore, more studies are needed to explore possible socio-demographic risk factors that could be associated with acquisition of these microorganisms (e.g."
"educational level, income, etc.)"
and also possible pathogenic mechanism(s) by which these STIs induce tubal damage and promote the development of EP.
"Although several studies reported an association between *N. gonorrhoeae* \[[@CR53], [@CR54]\], *U. parvum/urealyticum* \[[@CR55]--[@CR61]\] and *G. vaginalis* \[[@CR13], [@CR62], [@CR63]\] with PID and tubal pregnancy, the current study detected non-significant higher rates of these pathogens in the EP group."
"Currently, there is no report in the literature from KSA on the prevalence of the aforementioned pathogens."
"Although, we observed high rates of *U. parvum/urealyticum* and *G. vaginalis* in our study population, our data does not provide evidence whether these bacteria could be involved in adverse reproductive outcomes in Saudi women."
"Hence, additional studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to measure the role of these microorganisms in upper genital tract infections and poor reproductive performance in KSA."
"Additionally, commercial kits and/or an in house PCR technique should be used to differentiate between the biovars of ureaplasmas since the currently used kit does not distinguish between *U. parvum* and *U. urealyticum* since these microorganisms, especially GV and *U. parvum* are common in normal women."
*T. vaginalis* is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection with and estimated annual prevalence of 170 million new cases worldwide \[[@CR14]\].
"Although TV is associated with bacterial vaginosis and the subsequent development of PID \[[@CR64], [@CR65]\], currently there is no direct association between the protozoa and EP."
"However, several reports have previously demonstrated the isolation of TV from pelvic organs and upper genital tract tissues \[[@CR65]--[@CR67]\]."
The current findings are in agreement with the previous observations as we were able to detect TV in 4 tubal specimens collected from EP and none from the control group.
"However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the frequency of positive cases."
"Additionally, all positive cases had multiple infections with other sexually transmitted pathogens, suggesting that TV could indirectly induce EP by promoting the acquisition of other STIs \[[@CR68]--[@CR70]\]."
Further studies are required to explore the role(s) of TV in the pathogenesis of PID and tubal damage.
"Information about STIs in Islamic countries generally and in KSA specifically is notably limited \[[@CR18], [@CR71]\]."
Furthermore the majority of reports generated from Saudi Arabia focused on the frequency of *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae* and little is known about the other STIs included in our study.
"The first report by the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) on STIs between 1995--1999 has shown that among 39049 reported cases of STIs, the majority of patients were Saudi (70.4 %) and the prevalence among them was 84.1 % for non-gonococcal urethritis, 70.9 % for trichomoniasis, 77.1 % for gonococcal infection and 78 % for genital herpes."
"Furthermore, the estimated annual incidence was 14.8 for non-gonococcal infection, 9.4 for trichomoniasis, 5.2 for gonococcal urethritis and 0.1 for HSV per 100.000 population during the same period \[[@CR71]\]."
A more recent retrospective report that examined the records of the MOH during 2009 has also shown that STIs were more common in Saudi compared with non-Saudi and the majority of positive cases were females (92.2 %) during the reproductive age \[[@CR18]\].
"Studies that examined individual sexually transmitted pathogen have reported a prevalence of 4 to 21 % for chlamydial infection in asymptomatic pregnant women \[[@CR16], [@CR22], [@CR72]--[@CR75]\]."
Similar results were also reported by Alzahrani et al.
(2010) and they showed that 10.5 % of 95 healthy pregnant women were positive for *C. trachomatis* by serology and culture*.
"* However, the prevalence of chlamydial infection in 102 female patients attending the gynaecology clinic of the same hospital with symptoms of lower genital tract infection was 34.4 % \[[@CR16]\]."
"Additionally, more recent studies conducted among infertile women in the kingdom have reported *C. trachomatis* in 9.6 % by serology and 12.03 % by culture method \[[@CR22]\] and, the frequency ranges between 8-25 % by PCR \[[@CR17], [@CR21], [@CR76]\]."
The published reports on the prevalence of non-chlamydial sexually transmitted pathogens in KSA are few.
The rate of *N. gonorrhoeae* was 7.8 % among women with symptoms of lower genital tract infection \[[@CR16]\].
"Previous studies also demonstrated that the seroprevalence of HSV-1 among adult Saudi was 60 % using indirect immunoassay \[[@CR77], [@CR78]\]."
"Later, Ghazi et al."
(2002) reported a seroprevalence of 90.9 % for HSV-1 and 27.1 % for HSV-2 in normal pregnant women \[[@CR79]\].
"A more recent study showed that the frequency of HSV-1 and HSV-2 among 459 pregnant Saudi women was 84.1 % and 6.8 %, respectively \[[@CR80]\]."
"Furthermore, Fageeh (2009) has reported an overall frequency of 74.5 % for HSVs in pregnant women attending to the emergency ward and among the positive HSV cases, IgG antibodies against CMV, *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae* were detected in 11.3 %, 12.8 % and 4.7 %, respectively \[[@CR23]\]."
"Recently, we have shown that the prevalence of *C. trachomatis* IgG, but not IgM, was significantly higher in Saudi patients with EP (18.5 %) compared with normal pregnancy (5 %)."
"Additionally, the frequency of HSV-1 IgG, but not HSV-2, was also higher in ectopic pregnancy (94.3 %) than in normal pregnancy (64 %) and the rate of detecting both IgM and IgG antibodies together either against HSV-1 or HSV-2 was higher in the ectopic (41.1 % and 30 %, respectively) compared to control (9 % and 16 %, respectively) \[[@CR81]\]."
Our results are in agreement with the previous studies conducted in the kingdom and they showed an overall prevalence of 19.25 % for chlamydia infection.
"The frequency was 27.4 % for EP, which is comparable to those reported from patients with infertility and urogenital symptoms \[[@CR16], [@CR17], [@CR76]\]."
"Additionally, positive cases for HSV-1/2 DNA represented 15.6 % of the study population and the rates were also significantly higher in the EP group (21.4 %) compared with control (5.9 %)."
The overall rate of gonococcal infection in this report was 4.44 % and there was no significant difference in the frequency of positive cases between the EP (5.9 %) and control (1.9 %) groups.
"Our observations provide further support for the recent call to implement a national screening program for the detection of STIs in KSA \[[@CR5], [@CR16], [@CR21], [@CR76]\]."
A drawback to our study is that we did not include other urogenital specimens (e.g.
"first void urine) and/or not performing serological studies, which would reflect on the prevalence of lower genital tract infection and previous exposure to the pathogens of interest in our study population."
"Nevertheless, the currently used samples are more appropriate to provide a better reflection on the rate of upper genital tract infection, which is aligned with our study objectives."
"Additionally, we did not confirm the results of this study by a different technique and/or other well-established commercial PCR kits."
"However, the used kit is IVD CE certified and we further performed extra steps to validate the observed results."
"Nevertheless, future studies should consider the inclusion of other commercial/in-house PCR protocols or confirm the results with additional laboratory techniques."
A further limitation is that we were not able to identify other confounding factors that could have a role in the observed increase in the prevalence of STIs among Saudi women diagnosed with EP (e.g.
"number of sexual partners, socio-economic factors, etc."
"), which was mainly due to social and culture restrictions since discussion of STIs in the Saudi community is considered taboo due to ethics and many social factors that create several obstacles \[[@CR5], [@CR16], [@CR17], [@CR19], [@CR21]\]."
"Conclusions {#Sec15}
===========

Infection of the upper genital tract with STIs is common in Saudi women from the Western region during the reproductive age and the prevalence of *C. trachomatis*, *M. genitalium* and HSV-1/2 was significantly higher in the EP group."
"Hence, future studies on the effect of these microorganisms on tubal ciliary beat frequency and the expression of implantation markers by the tubal epithelium are required to establish whether they play a role in the pathogenesis of EP."
"Additionally, the observed high rates of co-infection advocate the necessity of establishing national guidelines and/or screening program in the kingdom that could probably adopt syndromic approach using multiplex PCR technique for the simultaneous detection of the common sexually transmitted pathogens among high risk groups."
Further studies are needed to explore the potential socio-economic risk factors associated with the acquisition of STIs and to measure their secondary adverse reproductive outcomes in Saudi Arabia.

"Introduction {#sec1-marinedrugs-18-00412}
===============

Strategies to help promote immune competence remain of interest for a range of specific population groups and have frequently included the use of dietary supplements."
The use of bioactive ingredients from marine-based sources for formulation as food constituents and nutritional supplements is recognized as under-explored in comparison to ingredients from traditional agricultural or synthetic sources \[[@B1-marinedrugs-18-00412]\].
"The global market for nutraceutical-type products has been estimated to exceed \$380 billion per annum by 2020 \[[@B2-marinedrugs-18-00412]\], and there is a critical need for further exploration of marine-based bioactives to ensure that consumer demand is met by products that are both safe and have demonstrated positive health effects."
The potential for whole seaweed consumption to have positive health effects has been reviewed previously \[[@B3-marinedrugs-18-00412]\].
"Further, the bioactive properties of constituent compounds isolated from marine algae continues to be of interest."
One such compound is fucoidan.
"Fucoidans are a group of high molecular weight, fucose-based polysaccharides recognized as a key component of particular brown macroalgae species \[[@B4-marinedrugs-18-00412]\]."
"The bioactive properties of fucoidan preparations have been assessed in a range of in vitro and animal models \[[@B5-marinedrugs-18-00412]\] and include demonstrated antimicrobial \[[@B6-marinedrugs-18-00412]\], antiviral \[[@B7-marinedrugs-18-00412]\] and anticancer \[[@B8-marinedrugs-18-00412]\] effects."
"While evidence from animal models suggests fucoidans may also possess immune-modulating effects \[[@B9-marinedrugs-18-00412],[@B10-marinedrugs-18-00412]\], the ability of fucoidans to act as potential modulators of mucosal health generally, and mucosal immune function appears underappreciated and requires further investigation given (i) the fucose-based structure of fucoidans, (ii) the role of fucose as a terminal sugar in human mucin glycoproteins \[[@B11-marinedrugs-18-00412]\], and (iii) evidence from ex vivo tissue preparations suggesting fucose may regulate gut motility \[[@B12-marinedrugs-18-00412]\]."
We utilized a cohort of professional team-sport athletes to explore the potential impacts of fucoidan on gut markers of immunity and inflammation.
"The potential for intense physical activity to induce alterations in immune function, including markers of mucosal immunity, and increase risk for upper respiratory symptoms has been of interest for several decades \[[@B13-marinedrugs-18-00412],[@B14-marinedrugs-18-00412]\]."
"Assessment of mucosal immune competence in athletes has typically utilized saliva samples and included assessment of both innate (e.g., lactoferrin and lysozyme) and adaptive (e.g., secretory immunoglobulin A; sIgA) markers and is considered relevant to protective mechanisms in the upper respiratory tract."
"Indeed, associations between low mucosal (tear) lysozyme concentrations \[[@B15-marinedrugs-18-00412]\] and salivary IgA \[[@B16-marinedrugs-18-00412],[@B17-marinedrugs-18-00412]\] and risk for upper respiratory tract infection are reported in the literature."
"Interestingly, assessment of immune markers from other mucosal sites has been less common, which is somewhat surprising given the growing interest in gut health in athletic populations."
"In this regard, high-performance and elite athletes represent a unique population for assessment of potential positive effects of fucoidan supplementation on markers of mucosal immune function."
2.
"Results {#sec2-marinedrugs-18-00412}
==========

The supplement was well-tolerated by participants with no adverse events reported."
"At baseline, fecal lysozyme concentrations were \~73% higher in the healthy adults compared to the professional athletes (*p* = 0.001; [Table 1](#marinedrugs-18-00412-t001){ref-type=""table""})."
No significant differences in baseline concentrations between groups were observed in either fecal calprotectin (*p* = 0.45) or sIgA (*p* = 0.76).
"Consideration of patterns of change in fecal markers (i.e., proportion of individuals showing an increase, decrease or no change in response to supplementation) in response to the seven days of supplementation suggested fecal calprotectin (*p* = 0.44) and sIgA (*p* = 0.37) responses did not differ between groups."
"In contrast, a different pattern of response was noted between groups for fecal lysozyme (*p* = 0.002), with a greater proportion of the professional athletes (74% of the group) showing an increase in response to supplementation when compared to the healthy adults (9% of the group)."
"For the professional athletes, a significant (\~45%) increase in fecal lysozyme was observed following the supplementation period (*p* = 0.001; [Table 1](#marinedrugs-18-00412-t001){ref-type=""table""})."
"For the healthy adults, trends for reductions in both fecal calprotectin (\~25%; *p* = 0.07) and lysozyme (\~15%; *p* = 0.06) were observed following the supplementation period ([Table 1](#marinedrugs-18-00412-t001){ref-type=""table""})."
"Individual responses are illustrated in [Figure 1](#marinedrugs-18-00412-f001){ref-type=""fig""}."
3.
"Discussion {#sec3-marinedrugs-18-00412}
=============

Collectively, these data provide preliminary evidence to support the potential for fucoidan to positively impact fecal innate immune markers."
Of particular note was the significant increase in fecal lysozyme concentrations in professional athletes in response to supplementation.
"Lysozyme is secreted from Paneth cells, in the intestinal crypts, onto the mucosal surface \[[@B18-marinedrugs-18-00412]\] and is excreted with the gut luminal contents allowing for determination of fecal lysozyme concentrations."
"Lysozyme is recognized as possessing both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions \[[@B19-marinedrugs-18-00412]\], and evidence from animal models suggests a role for lysozyme in promoting mucosal barrier integrity \[[@B20-marinedrugs-18-00412]\]."
"Considering these functions, the increase in fecal lysozyme may reflect improvements in mucosal health."
The increase in fecal lysozyme concentrations in professional athletes is also worth considering further given that lower fecal lysozyme concentrations were observed compared to the healthy adults prior to supplementation.
"This observation is not dissimilar to reports of impaired immune defenses (primarily at other mucosal sites) in elite athletes, including reports of decreasing salivary lysozyme in rugby players across a sporting season \[[@B21-marinedrugs-18-00412]\]."
"Considering this, the return of fecal lysozyme concentrations to levels comparable to those noted for the healthy adults suggests that further exploration of the ability of fucoidan to promote the secretion of antimicrobial peptides at mucosal surfaces in specific population groups is warranted."
"It is also worth mentioning that the trend for a modest (15%) reduction in lysozyme concentrations among healthy adults appears to be driven by a small number of individuals ([Figure 1](#marinedrugs-18-00412-f001){ref-type=""fig""}A)."
The heterogeneity in this response means it is difficult to conclude whether fucoidan supplementation would be similarly beneficial in population groups where fecal lysozyme concentrations are within adequate homeostatic norms.
This should be explored in future studies.
Changes in other fecal markers were not as compelling in response to fucoidan supplementation in either group.
Fecal calprotectin is used clinically as a marker of intestinal inflammation \[[@B22-marinedrugs-18-00412]\].
"While fecal calprotectin concentrations were generally considered negative (based on a clinical threshold of 100 mg/L), suggesting a likely absence of active inflammation of the gut mucosa in the study participants, we did note a trend for reduced concentrations in the healthy adults."
"\[[@B22-marinedrugs-18-00412]\] Given the modest concentrations observed and the heterogeneity in the patterns of response between healthy adults ([Figure 1](#marinedrugs-18-00412-f001){ref-type=""fig""}B), the trend for a reduction in calprotectin in response to fucoidan supplementation needs to be confirmed in additional cohorts, including where evidence of intestinal inflammation (elevated calprotectin) exists."
The potential for fucoidan supplementation to modulate intestinal inflammation has been reported previously in a murine mucositis model \[[@B23-marinedrugs-18-00412]\].
"Similarly, reports indicating that fucoidan can enhance the expression of key intestinal tight junction proteins in an in vitro model \[[@B24-marinedrugs-18-00412]\], when considered in conjunction with the findings described here, support the need for further assessment of the potential for fucoidan to promote gut health, in additional to potential beneficial mucosal immune effects."
This study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that fucoidan may have the potential to promote the secretion of antimicrobial peptides at the gut mucosa and contribute to the regulation of mucosal inflammation.
"It is recognized that the modest sample size and lack of dietary control in the current study necessitates that these findings be confirmed in a larger controlled trial, and this further work may help to resolve the heterogeneity observed in some of the patterns of response (for example the trends for reduced fecal calprotectin and lysozyme in healthy adults following supplementation)."
"However, the outcomes provide early evidence to suggest that fucoidan may be a supplement that could be beneficial in promoting mucosal immune competence in specific population groups."

"Materials and Methods {#sec4-marinedrugs-18-00412}
========================

To explore the potential impacts of fucoidan on gut markers of immunity and inflammation, we performed a retrospective analysis of stored fecal samples collected from professional team-sport athletes (*n* = 22; all male; age: 24.7 ± 4.6 years; BMI: 25.1 ± 1.2 kg/m^2^) who supplemented 1 g/d fucoidan (*Fucus vesiculosus*/*Undaria pinnatifida* extract, Marinova Pty Ltd., Cambridge, TAS, Australia) during a week-long pre-season training camp."
Samples were stored at −80 degrees following collection and had been thawed once prior to the analysis described herein.
"Comparisons were made to accessible samples which had been obtained from otherwise healthy adults (*n* = 11; 6 females, 5 males; age: 38.8 ± 9.8 years; BMI: 22.9 ± 2.5 kg/m^2^) prior to and following one week of supplementation with fucoidan (1 g/d)."
"The composition of the fucoidan supplement was 50.5% neutral carbohydrates, 18.6% sulfate, 7.0% counter-ions, 11.2% polyphenols and 4.6% uronic acids."
This analysis was performed with the approval of the Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee (ref \#2018/923).
All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.
"Assessment of fecal concentrations of calprotectin, sIgA and lysozyme were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA; Immunodiagnostik, Bensheim, Germany) specific for assessment of fecal samples."
"Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and all samples were assessed in duplicate."
"Typical intra-assay variability was 4.0% for calprotectin, 4.0% for sIgA and 5.2% for lysozyme."
A high-range and low-range quality control were provided for inclusion in each assay; all quality controls measured within the suggested ranges.
The impact of fucoidan on fecal markers was assessed by comparing concentrations pre- and post-supplementation.
"Patterns of change in each outcome measure were initially assessed in a semi-quantitative manner and classified as either an increase, decrease or no change (less than a 10% increase or decrease)."
Differences in patterns of response between groups were assessed using a Chi-squared test.
"Subsequently, the distributions of outcome measures were inspected, and data were log-transformed to approximate conditional normality."
Differences between pre- and post-supplementation time-points were assessed using a paired sample *t*-test.
An independent sample *t*-test was used to compare baseline (pre-supplementation) concentrations between groups.
"Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA)."
Statistical significance was accepted at *p* \< 0.05.

"Quote:

So how does a government, such as ours, go from limited power that literally had no direct impact on the lives of the citizens of the states to one of tyrannical proportions?"
You cannot make improvements to your own property without permission and paying a tribute.
You have the flow of toilets and shower heads dictated to you on what you can and cannot have.
"We have been using incandescent light bulbs for years but now the government is forcing you to use highly toxic, mercury filled, bulbs (for our own good)."
And the list of expansive government powers is as long as the list of government agencies and sub-agencies within the federal government.
But it did not happen overnight.

"I sympathize with the Oath Keepers, and I see where they are coming from; widespread, ever more intrusive regulation is problem on all levels of government."
"On the other hand, there ARE such things as externalities and market failure, and there ARE such things as water shortages and pollution."
Nor will these problems spontaneously solve themselves.
"Nor is the government going to knock down your door and seize your light bulbs, or your toilet, or your shower head."
They are regulating what may be sold.
"That is a constraint on freedom, but you know, not in the same category as, well, indefinite detention or the gun point seizure of old fashioned light bulbs."
"I'll also point out that most other civilized countries have comparable environmental regulations, and yet have no equivalent to the NDAA."
"Or the TSA, for that matter."
"Indeed, much have much more oppressive environmental regulations than we do, and yet they seem to have a far lower rate of doors being violently knocked down for regulatory violations ."
.
.
"I fear, Oathkeepers, that the problem lies not in our environmental regulations, but in ourselves."
Because the public actually seems to care more about lightbulb regulations and toilets than it does about indefinite detention.
"Indeed, the House has tried to delay the implementation of the lightbulb regulations ."
.
.
but they did not even blink at the NDAA.
"Apparently, we can cite the Constitution and all our Congressmen about our right to use an inefficient lightbulb (indirectly harming other citizens in the long run) a right that is not expressly stated in the Constitution, but we cannot bother to do so to protect our right not to be detained indefinitely without trial, a right that certainly IS expressly guaranteed by the Constitution."
"Oh, and actually ."
.
.
about those light bulbs .
.
.
"you are not forced to use compact florescents (which, by the way, are not all that toxic unless you got in the habit of eating them or are the world's absolute clumsiest homeowner)."
The light bulb companies have developed more efficient incandescent bulbs for people who want to use them and will be making them available.
"If you like, you can use those."
LEDs are also becoming more feasible as bulbs.
The change in the law seems to have spawned a wave of light source innovation as companies are forced to find a way to produce a light bulb that people like and find affordable.
"Perhaps that would have happened anyway, perhaps not."
"But lets represent the situation accurately, please?"

Unfortunately, the result of such rhetoric is a public that doesn't see a difference between lightbulbs and indefinite detention, or worse, gets really upset about lightbulbs but cheers torture and indefinite detention."
"Feeding the ignorance of a public that deals only generalities and only responds to hyperbole simply results in an ever more hysterical and ill-informed public (and worse, convinces moderate members of the public that people objecting to grievous civil rights violations are paranoid lunatics) Not to mention the alienation of allies that think ""I'm talking about fundamental human and civil rights, and you're comparing it to light bulb regulations?"
"Excuse me?"""
"Although I recognize that ever increasing involvement in people's lives is a matter for concern, and the ever increasing number of federal crimes and incomprehensible regulations is a genuine liberty issue, I'll point out that the sort of gross violations of the Constitution represented by the NDAA have occurred virtually since the Founding (see e.g."
the Alien and Sedition Acts).
It is not a straight line from petty economic regulations to arrest and detention without trial.
"Both may be unconstitutional, but they are not strongly interconnected ."
.
.
"and actually, the light bulb and toilet regulations are bad examples of that, since although I'm sure they weren't foreseen at the founding, they plausibly fit under the Commerce Clause."

"Lucknow: BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday tried to put BJP president Amit Shah on the dock over his claim that 250 terrorists were killed in the Indian air strikes in Pakistan, asking him why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""silent"" over it."
"""BJP chief Amit Shah is arduously making claim that IAF strike had killed over 250 terrorists in Pakistan but why his guru PM Modi who is always keen to take credit for everything is silent over it?"
"Terrorists killed is good news, but what is the secret behind deep silence of PM over it?,"" Mayawati posted on Twitter."
"At an event in Ahmedabad on Sunday, Shah had said the Indian Air Force (IAF) air strikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot last Tuesday ""killed more than 250 terrorists""."
"Mayawati also hit out at the economic policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, saying that benefits of economic growth not reaching to most of the poor, labourer, farmers of 130-crore population of country was a ""matter of serious concern""."
"""...what will be Modi Govt reply & jumlebazi (rhetoric) over a slowdown in farm and manufacturing pushing GDP growth to a low of 6.6%...?"""

Banking Made Personal Through Video

Updated August 9, 2018."
"In recent years, banks have created video advertisements that relay a common theme: personalized retail banking."
"This popular trend may be due to the negative connotations and lack of trust associated with big banks, especially since The Great Recession."
"According to a 2017 study by Statista, only 30% of people put a great deal of trust in big national banks."
"Although Accenture states trust in banks has been at its highest since 2012, “two-thirds of surveyed consumers said it was important a bank used personal data to provide advice relevant to their personal circumstances."
"In fact, personalization was the top cited factor for choosing a current bank account provider.”

With Bank of America’s reputation as the bank with the “broadest range of vulnerabilities,” it’s no surprise that the corporation has been trying to change its image."
"In hopes to gain client trust, the bank created an advertisingcampaign focusing on heartfelt relationships, the needs of the customer, and most prominently, personal connections."
"Each new ad ends with the message: “Life’s better when we’re connected.”

In the video titled Portraits, the central message, “we know we’re not the center of your life, but we’ll do our best to help you connect to what is,” helps portray Bank of America as a supportive and humanistic brand."
"The setting, characters, and flashbacks in the video also tug at the emotions of viewers and make the story relatable."
Chase Bank took a different personalized approach.
"In this funny commercial, a quirky couple walks their pet pig into Chase Bank to discuss their retirement plan."
"With “Boombastic” by Shaggy playing in the background, this lighthearted ad makes the bank feel like an approachable, trustworthy brand that will cater to you specifically."
"Associating the bank with peoples’ lives, instead of just “dollars and information” is a key aspect of the video which also personifies the company."
"U.S. Bank takes another creative, personal approach in The Escape."
The majority of this video is from a dog’s point of view.
"In NYC, this adorable pup doesn’t have a lot of space to roam free and play."
"At the end, he excitedly barks as we jump to a suburban setting with a nice home and a big backyard that his owners just bought."
He finally gets to run around freely.
"The narrator states, “whatever your financial goals are, a U.S. Bank wealth management advisor can help make them a reality.” This ad certainly plays on the emotions of viewers (especially pet owners/lovers in urban settings), and provides a nice touch with the message that U.S. Bank is there to help you reach your personal aspirations, like purchasing a big suburban home."
These are just a few of the many financial institutions trying to create a more client-friendly image through video.
"Building consumer trust in banks isn’t an easy task, but with videos like these, it’s certainly possible."

Frequency of administration of recombinant human erythropoietin for anaemia of end-stage renal disease in dialysis patients.
Although the benefits of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu EPO) administration in dialysis patients have been demonstrated the optimal frequency regimen has not as yet been established.
"Treatment with rHu EPO is expensive, there is therefore a need for optimising the efficiency of its administration."
"The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of different frequency regimens of rHu EPO administration in dialysis patients in terms of i) effectiveness (correction of anaemia, quality of life and freedom from adverse events) ii) efficiency (optimal resource use) of different rHu EPO dose regimen policies."
"We searched MEDLINE (1980 to May Week 3 2001), EMBASE (1984 to Week 24 2001), BIOSIS (1985 to January 1997), CINAHL (1982 to October 1997), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 1997), CHEMABS (1984 to November 1996), SIGLE (1980 to June 1996), CRIB (10th edition, 1995), UK NRR (14th consolidation, September 1996), RSC ( 1980 to February 1997), HealthSTAR (1995 to October 1997), IBSS (1984 to July 1997), NEED (July 1997) and reference lists of relevant articles."
We contacted biomedical companies and investigators in the field and we hand searched Kidney International (including all supplements but excluding all conference proceedings except for 1994) July 1983 to May 1997 inclusive.
The Internet was also searched on: August 1997.
We had also identified some studies from a previous broad search for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to the management of end-stage renal disease.
Date of the most recent search: June 2001.
All randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials comparing different frequencies of rHu EPO administration in dialysis patients.
Subgroup analyses were performed comparing haemodialysis and CAPD patients and also subcutaneous and intravenous administration.
Only published data were used.
Data were abstracted by a single investigator on to a standard form.
"The data abstracted were relevant to the predetermined outcome measures: measures of correction of anaemia, rHu EPO dose, quality of life measures, adverse events, number of withdrawals from study, mortality."
"Where appropriate, a summary relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data and a weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data."
Eight studies met our inclusion criteria.
"When once a week administration was compared with twice weekly there was no significant difference in the ability to maintain the target haemoglobin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.40)."
"Mean haemoglobin after twelve weeks of therapy was not different between the two groups (WMD -0.21g/dl, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.56)."
"No difference was found in mean haemoglobin or haematocrit at the end of any studies which compared once with thrice weekly administration of rHu EPO (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.06)."
"A single study which compared once with more that thrice weekly administration showed no significant difference in mean haemoglobin at the end of the maintenance phase (mean difference -0.2g/dl, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.25)."
"The dosage of erythropoietin required by those on haemodialysis receiving rHu EPO once weekly was just significantly more (WMD 12.0 U/kg, 95% CI 0.24 to 23.76) than those receiving it twice weekly but the confidence interval is wide."
"No such difference was found for CAPD patients nor when the results were combined (WMD 5.15 U/kg, 95% CI -3.74 to 14.05)."
"The result was not significant when comparing once weekly with thrice weekly administration (WMD 10.00 U/kg, 95% CI -80.87 to 100.87)."
There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events between any of the groups studies.
There is no significant difference between once weekly versus thrice weekly subcutaneous administration of rHu EPO.
"Once weekly administration of rHu EPO would require an additional 12U/kg/week for patients on haemodialysis, however this is based on one very small study."
"The cost of this additional hRu EPO nee, however this is based on one very small study."
"The cost of this additional hRu EPO needs to assessed, in particular with regard to patient preference and compliance."
"INTRODUCTION
============

There is a large literature in both cognitive neuroscience and behavioral psychology that seeks to characterize aspects of inner experience."
"A growing subset of studies has sought to use fMRI to identify neural correlates of inner experience, for example by studying thinking that is not tightly related to the current task."
This has been variously called mind wandering ([@B37]; [@B38]; [@B54]); inner experience during resting state ([@B12]); undirected thought ([@B40]); stimulus independent thought ([@B18]; [@B43]); task unrelated thought ([@B17]; [@B54]); spontaneous thought ([@B39]); daydreaming ([@B53]); free thought ([@B11]); and so on.
"Those terms have somewhat different meanings, but all depend centrally on directly apprehended phenomena of inner experience: for example, at time *t* I was thinking about my girlfriend while I was supposed to be doing my homework."
"Following [@B6], we will refer to all of these as ""undirected thoughts."""
Capturing the incidence and flow of such inner experience is an intriguing challenge for neuroimaging.
"Undirected thoughts have been mostly studied either by contrasting passive ""baseline"" periods with an active, stimulus-driven task (see [@B52]) or in terms of connectivity between different brain regions in a resting state (e.g., [@B19])."
"The identification of brain areas and networks associated with rest allows for brain-behavior correlations to be examined: for instance, self-reports of a particular experience, such as anxiety, can be correlated across a group of individuals with responses in particular brain regions ([@B44]; [@B9]; [@B11])."
"Of particular note, the ""default mode network"" (DMN) refers to a set of regions that appear to be consistently anti-correlated with task-positive activity and associated with introspective processes ([@B48]; [@B5])."
"There are, however, a range of other networks also thought to be active during resting periods, such as those guiding attentional and executive control ([@B54])."
"Recently a number of novel methods have been developed to induce and examine undirected thoughts, most of which have targeted instances of mind wandering."
"One approach is to train participants on a particular cognitive task that is conducive to mind wandering, deploy the task in the scanner, ask participants to report instances of mind wandering, and then correlate this with DMN activity ([@B45]; [@B43])."
Another approach has been to ask participants to respond to random probes and report on their subjective state while performing a repetitive task in the scanner ([@B7]; [@B1]; [@B55]) or during task-free rest periods ([@B56]).
"For instance, [@B7] probed participants during a go/no-go task and asked them to use Likert scales to indicate (a) whether their attention was focused on the task and (b) whether they were aware of their attentional state at that time (""concurrent awareness"")."
"Self-reported mind wandering states were associated with increased activation of typical areas of the DMN and the central executive network, and this was particularly the case for mind wandering without concurrent awareness ([@B7])."
These methods offer novel ways of investigating undirected thoughts.
"Nevertheless, they all involve a trade-off of some kind."
Experiences can be sampled immediately by asking participants to make a forced-choice discrimination while in the scanner.
"But such techniques almost always preclude detailed descriptions of experience; experience sampling techniques are typically used simply as classifiers of two or three different ""modes"" of thinking (such as being ""on-task"" vs. ""off-task""; [@B7])."
"If researchers have wanted to know more about the nature of that state, they have occasionally inquired via questionnaire or interview, but these inquiries have always been retrospective, outside the scanner ([@B8]; [@B11]; [@B10])."
"However, such retrospective reporting undermines the immediacy of the sampling method, because self-reporting on experience after a delay may be subject to a range of reporting biases ([@B12]) and is likely to reflect presuppositions about the experience rather than direct apprehensions of experiential phenomena ([@B25])."
"A technique with the potential to offer an alternative method is descriptive experience sampling (DES; [@B22], [@B23], [@B24]; [@B28], [@B29], [@B30]; [@B26]; [@B34]; [@B20]; [@B21]; [@B33])."
"DES uses a random beeper to signal participants to attend to the experience that is ongoing at the moment of the beep, and immediately thereafter to jot down notes about that ongoing experience."
"Within 24 h the DES investigator conducts an ""expositional interview"" to discover the characteristics of the beeped pristine experience."
This process is repeated over a number of days (usually 4--6).
"DES differs from other experience sampling methods in that it aims to help participants bracket their tendencies to report presuppositions and thereby aims to produce high fidelity descriptions of ""pristine"" inner experiences---thoughts, feelings, sensations, seeings, hearings, and so on as they naturally occur in a person's everyday environment."
"It therefore does not specify characteristics that are to be rated in a forced-choice manner, but instead explores characteristics that emerge ([@B24]) from the individual person's own experience, untainted (as much as possible) by the investigator's predilections."
"There are five experiential phenomena that DES claims occur frequently ([@B20]); we will call those the 5FP for ""5 frequent phenomena"": inner speaking ([@B33]), inner seeing (aka visual imagery), unsymbolized thinking ([@B27]), sensory awareness ([@B32]), and feelings ([@B21])."
"However, DES is fundamentally an idiographic procedure, which implies that in any particular individual it is possible that one or more of those characteristics are present, that none of those characteristics are present, or that one or another of those characteristic might be present in an idiosyncratic way."
"Thus the 5FP are sometimes convenient ways to characterize an individual, sometimes not."
"That is, DES in general has no expectations about what might emerge as the characteristics of any individual's inner experience."
"The DES procedure is ""open-beginninged"" ([@B30]; [@B34]; [@B25]) in the sense that the DES interviewer does *not* set out to inquire whether a participant is innerly speaking, or is innerly seeing, or so on."
"If a participant, describing her experience without benefit of the DES categories, describes (for example) inner speaking (regardless of the words she chooses in so describing), the DES investigator will continue to explore whether inner speaking was ongoing at the moment of the beep."
The DES process can produce surprising results.
"For example, inner speech is held by some to occur during every waking moment ([@B2]; [@B3]; [@B35]) and by others to occur about three-quarters of the time (e.g., [@B40])."
"DES studies by Hurlburt and colleagues, however, hold that inner speaking is present on average only about one-quarter of the time and in many people never or only very rarely ([@B20]; [@B33])."
"[@B25] has argued that discrepancies in reports of many experiential phenomena are common because many if not most people do not know the characteristics of their own inner experience, and instead rely on presuppositions that interfere with their ability to report reliably and accurately."
"Furthermore, [@B20] report huge individual differences in the frequency of inner seeing, feelings, and other forms of inner experience, raising further concerns about how assumptions about the nature of inner experience might influence self-report."
"In contrast to other methods, then, DES aims to clear out these assumptions and train participants to be more careful in reporting their experiences by avoiding generalizations, focusing on a precise moment (just before the beep), and interviewing participants not just once but on multiple occasions, in an iterative manner ([@B24], [@B25])."
It remains to be seen whether such an idiographic procedure can be of value to neuroscientific investigations of inner experience and undirected thought.
"The challenge is to convert such a highly detailed method for use with fMRI, and then to test (using evidence from cognitive neuroscience) the claim that DES can offer a reliable reflection of participants' experiences."
"Two of us (SK, a neuroscientist, and CF, a psychologist) invited DES-creator Hurlburt (hereafter called RH, whose work we knew but with whom we had no relationship) to put the DES method to the test."
"We recruited five participants, all unknown to RH and unrelated to us, and invited RH to perform a typical DES investigation with each."
"Data on all five participants is reported elsewhere as part of a wider study (Hurlburt et al., in preparation)."
"Our aim here is to establish proof-of-principle in a single participant that idiographic investigation of inner experience, such as is provided by DES, can be successfully combined with fMRI."
"As such we only report here on one of those participants, ""Lara,"" an 18 year-old-woman."
"As with the other participants, RH trained Lara in the usual DES way (four sampling days in her natural environments); then we delivered random DES beeps to her in nine sessions while she was in an MRI scanner, four random beeps per 25-min session."
"Immediately after each session, RH conducted a typical DES interview with her about the four beeped experiences."
"Before the fMRI data were analyzed, RH descriptively characterized those 36 in-the-scanner moments of Lara's experience; these 36 DES characterizations were used to form participant-specific categories on which the fMRI contrasts would be based."
"In a preliminary phase at the start of the study, for possible comparison with the DES results, we also asked Lara to perform conventional neuroscience imagination tasks in the scanner: we directed her to generate specific verbal, auditory, visual, emotional, and somatosensory imagery when instructed by prompts such as ""to see a pencil"" or ""to say 'lamp'."""
"These conventional tasks could then be used to test whether the neuroimaging results derived from the DES method were plausible, localizable, and comparable to brain activity determined by conventional (non-introspective) means."
"Because of the idiographic, open-beginninged nature of DES, at the outset of Lara's DES sampling, we had no expectations about whether one or more of the 5FP might emerge as a salient characteristic of her inner experience."
"Nonetheless, to facilitate nomothetic comparison it is useful to consider the 5FP if they emerge."
"It turned out that for Lara, according to DES, sensory awareness was the most frequent of the 5FP (27 occasions or 75% of Lara's 36 in-scanner samples); however, its varying modality (visual, bodily, auditory, etc.)"
made it an unlikely candidate for neural correlation.
"Inner seeing occurred in 8 (22%) of Lara's 36 in-scanner samples; however, inner seeing had never occurred in Lara's natural environment DES sampling, so it seemed likely to be an artifact of the scanner situation."
"Inner speaking occurred in 8 (22%) of Lara's 36 in-scanner samples; it had also occurred in 13% of Lara's natural environment DES sampling, so inner speaking seems a good candidate for further consideration."
"Of the remaining 5FP phenomena, unsymbolized thinking and feelings were too rare \[one occasion (3%) each\]."
(Percentages do not add to 100% because multiple ratings are possible.)
"Thus, as a result of Lara's idiographic experiential result, we will focus here on Lara's inner speech-related neural processing."
"The neuroimaging literature suggests that language or speech-based samples are typically associated with brain areas such as left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the superior and middle temporal gyri ([@B47]; [@B15]), with inner speech processes in particular being linked to activation in left IFG and lateral temporal areas ([@B51], [@B50]; [@B36]; [@B42]; [@B41])."
"Damage to left IFG is also associated with impairment on inner speech tasks (e.g., [@B16])."
"If Hurlburt's claims about DES were correct, the fMRI data collected during Lara's eight inner-speaking (according to DES) moments should involve brain activation in some or all of the above-mentioned areas."
"If this was observed, it would provide support to the principle that DES and fMRI might be profitably combined."
"MATERIALS AND METHODS {#s1}
=====================

The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, with approval of the German Psychological Society Ethics Committee."
"Lara was scheduled for 19 sessions across a 2-week period, which was divided into four phases."
She was right-handed and aged 18.
"In Phase 1 (*introduction/in-scanner elicitation*), we fully explained the study; administered the initial questionnaires not relevant to the present report; and familiarized Lara with the MRI scanner and procedures."
"Then Lara entered the scanner, where we conducted a 10 min structural scan and a 5 min resting state scan according to standard fMRI research procedures (keep the eyes closed, stay relaxed and calm)."
"Then we administered the imagination task, derived from a recent fMRI paradigm used by [@B4]."
"Participants in the scanner were shown short written prompts to imagine saying (e.g., ""to say 'pencil',"" or ""to say 'lamp""'), seeing (""to see a pencil,"" ""to see a lamp""), hearing, feeling, or sensing something."
"The stimuli were presented in mini-blocks consisting of four prompts of one of the five categories, each shown for 7 s with 1 s inter-stimulus interval ( =32 s in total)."
Thus one mini-block consisted of four seeing prompts; another mini-block consisted of four saying prompts; and so on.
Participants were instructed to imagine vividly what was shown on the screen for the duration of the presentation of the prompt.
After four prompts a fixation cross was shown for 19 s before the next mini-block of prompts was presented.
"In Phase 2 (*natural-environment DES*), we instructed Lara in the use of the DES beeper and the sampling task ([@B30]; [@B25]): she was to wear the beeper in her natural environment for approximately 3 h, during which she would hear (through an earphone) six randomly occurring 700 Hz beeps."
"Her task was to terminate the beep (a button press) and then immediately to jot down notes about her ongoing inner experience that was ""in flight"" at the moment the beep sounded."
"Later that day or the next day she returned for a DES expositional interview about those six beeped experiences; this interview was conducted by RH and at least one and as many as four additional interviewers (the study was part of a training program), usually including some combination of SK, CF, and BAD."
"The expositional interviews were ""iterative"" ([@B24], [@B25]), designed to provide increasing-across-sampling-days skill in apprehending and describing inner experience."
"Following this interview, Lara returned to her everyday environment, during which (and on the same day) she responded to six more random beeps."
The following day she returned for a second expositional interview about the second-sampling-day's six beeped experiences.
"This sequence was repeated twice more, so that Lara sampled in four natural-environment periods, each followed by an expositional interview."
"In Phase 3 (*in-scanner DES*), Lara (having been trained in DES in the natural environment) entered the scanner for a 25-min session with the instruction to keep the eyes open, stay relaxed and calm."
"That is, we did not set any particular task for her other than to respond to the DES beep (700 Hz, except these beeps were of 1.4 s duration); she had been instructed to note her experience that was ongoing *just prior* to the beep (that is, in the usual DES way)."
"At four quasi-random times, she received a DES beep through a headphone."
"Immediately after each beep, she jotted a few notes about her experience on a clipboard positioned on her lap (viewable through a mirror); that is, this procedure mirrored as closely as possible the natural-environment DES procedure."
"Immediately after she exited the scanner she participated in a DES expositional interview (conducted by RH and some combination of SK and BAD) about each of her four randomly beeped experiences, in the order in which they appeared (although doubling back and looking ahead was allowed)."
"This 25-min fMRI scan/four beeps with jotted notes/expositional interview sequence was repeated a total of nine times, resulting in 4 × 9 = 36 random samples of experience occurring in 25 × 9 = 225 min of fMRI scanning."
"In Phase 4 (*post-DES resting state*), Lara entered the scanner for another 10 min structural scan and a 5 min standard resting-state scan."
"Immediately after exiting the scanner, she completed questionnaires not relevant here."
Then she was candidly debriefed.
"SCANNING PROCEDURE
------------------

Images were collected on a 3T Magnetom Trio MRI scanner system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel radio frequency head coil."
"Structural images were obtained using a three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE) based on the ADNI protocol ([www.adni-info.org](http://www.adni-info.org)) \[repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms; echo time (TE) = 4.77 ms; TI = 1100 ms, acquisition matrix = 256 × 256 × 176, flip angle = 7; 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm voxel size\]."
"Functional images were collected using a T2^∗^-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, image matrix = 64 × 64, FOV = 216 mm, flip angle = 80, voxel size 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm, 36 axial slices)."
"fMRI DATA PRE-PROCESSING AND MAIN ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------

The fMRI data were analyzed using SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK)."
The first four volumes of all EPI series were excluded from the analysis to allow the magnetization to approach a dynamic equilibrium.
Data processing started with slice time correction and realignment of the EPI datasets.
"A mean image for all EPI volumes was created, to which individual volumes were spatially realigned by means of rigid body transformations."
The structural image was co-registered with the mean image of the EPI series.
"Then the structural image was normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, and the normalization parameters were applied to the EPI images to ensure an anatomically informed normalization."
A commonly applied filter of 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) was used.
Low-frequency drifts in the time domain were removed by modeling the time series for each voxel by a set of discrete cosine functions to which a cut-off of 128 s was applied.
The statistical analyses were performed using the general linear model (GLM).
The imagination task was modeled as blocks with a duration of 32 s. The beeps of the DES procedure were modeled as events on the onset of the beep with a duration of 0.
These vectors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its temporal derivatives.
"For the DES procedure, we asked RH, on the basis of the DES expositional interviews he (and others) had conducted, to classify each of Lara's 36 in-the-scanner experiences into four modalities: verbal, visual, bodily, and auditory (categories could overlap)."
"We also asked RH to classify each of Lara's experiences according to which (if any) of the 5FP (inner speaking, inner seeing, unsymbolized thinking, feeling, and sensory awareness) were present."
RH's classifications were checked by at least one other person who had been present at the relevant interview; disagreements were resolved by consensus.
"Then, regressors were built coding the categories that RH had assigned to the 36 events."
For display purposes the resulting SPMs were thresholded at *p* \< 0.001 and a significant effect was reported when the volume of the cluster was greater than the Monte-Carlo-simulation-determined minimum cluster size above which the probability of type I error was \< 0.05 (AlphaSim; [@B57]).
The resulting maps were overlaid onto a normalized T1 weighted MNI template (colin27) and the coordinates reported correspond to the MNI coordinate system.
"RESULTS
=======

In Phase 1 (*introduction/in-scanner elicitation*) we investigated whether Lara would produce results that aligned with what conventional neuroscience would predict for inner speaking."
"**Figure [1A](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}** shows a comparison of mini-blocks in which Lara had been instructed to imagine herself speaking (but not actually speaking aloud) compared against mini-blocks in which a fixation cross was shown."
"This figure shows that Lara's brain produced the predicted activation of the inner speech network: left IFG and STS as well as superior and middle temporal gyrus (see also **Table [1A](#T1A){ref-type=""table""}**)."

There was no fMRI data collected during Phase 2."
In Phase 3 we ask first whether the DES interviews conducted by RH are capable of classifying Lara's verbal experience in ways that correspond to her neurophysiological activation.
"**Figure [1B](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}** shows that when we compare Lara's brain activity in those moments that RH classified as verbal to those classified as nonverbal (visual, bodily, or auditory), Lara showed the predicted activation of left IFG (see also **Table [1B](#T1B){ref-type=""table""}**)."

Next in Phase 3, we examine the 5FP category of inner speaking."
"Samples that included inner speaking were spread throughout the scanning sessions: three samples occurred during the third scanning session, one each during the fourth, seventh, and eighth scans, and two during the ninth scan."
We modeled brain activity across all 36 samples as a function of whether RH had said inner speaking was or was not present.
"We did the same kind of univariate modeling across all 36 samples for each of the remaining four 5FP characteristics (that is, for inner seeing, for unsymbolized thinking, for feelings, and for sensory awareness)."
"Then across the eight samples in which RH had said inner speaking was present, we compared the average of results of the inner speaking model to the average of the results of the four remaining models; this analysis indicated the presence of activity in left IFG, the core of the inner speech network (**Figure [1C](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}**, **Table [1C](#T1C){ref-type=""table""}**)."
We compared inner speaking to the non-inner-speaking samples instead of comparing against baseline because baseline includes times during which Lara was responding to (jotting down notes about) samples.

Because DES is primarily an idiographic technique, it is held to be capable of describing characteristics that apply to one individual, regardless of whether those characteristics are important for many or any other individuals."
"Therefore we asked RH to identify characteristics that might emerge from Lara's participation in the DES procedure (during either or both the natural environment and the in-the-scanner phases) that are not standard modality features (verbal, visual, bodily, and auditory) and that are not identified as 5FP, regardless of whether the feature was a characteristic of any other DES participant."
"One such feature that RH noted was that when Lara experienced inner words, they ranged on a continuum from innerly spoken to innerly heard ([@B33])."
The distinction between speaking and hearing may be illustrated by the metaphor of speaking into a tape recorder (production) and hearing your voice being played back (reception).
"Contrasting Lara's brain activity during moments of inner speaking vs. moments of inner hearing of her own voice resulted in increased activity in left IFG (**Figure [1D](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}**, **Table [1D](#T1D){ref-type=""table""}**)."

DISCUSSION
==========

To summarize, whether prompted using a conventional imagery-based fMRI paradigm or classified via use of the DES, Lara's experiences of inner speaking were, as expected, reliably associated with activation in left IFG."
"This validates the suggestion that it is indeed possible for the DES procedure to apprehend features of inner experience and to do so as they naturally occur---the present study, for example, did not set out to investigate inner speaking; it set out to investigate naturally occurring characteristics of Lara's inner experience *whatever those characteristics might be*."
"DES identified inner speaking as an important feature of Lara's experience, and our study design allowed us then to demonstrate predicted fMRI activations during the occurrence of that feature."
"The validation of high fidelity apprehensions of inner experience demonstrated in the present study should not be taken as a validation of all introspective or subjective reports---DES is, by [@B46]'s ([@B46]; cf."
"[@B25], p. 195) analysis, an exceptional method."
"Furthermore, the present study should not be taken as a validation of all DES-type reports---the demonstration here was by just one DES investigator (and his colleagues) with one participant."
"However, [@B29] showed that inter-rater reliability could be high between DES practitioners."
"A related question is the one raised previously, namely why we presented the case of Lara and not some or all of the other participants."
"First, it is not possible to combine disparate idiographic cases in a single journal article."
"Second, even if the case of Lara were the only interesting case of the five, it is enough to establish an important principle: fMRI data and particular-moment-experiential data can be profitably combined at least for some participants in some situations."
"The combination of phenomenology and neurophysiology might be understood as a validation of DES: claims about private experience are always questionable, and the fact that the DES claims correlate with known neurophysiological results lends non-trivial support to the adequacy of the DES claims."
"However, the validation could be understood to operate the other way around: that the DES descriptions lend support to fMRI techniques as a way of investigating short-duration phenomenological characteristics."
"Either way, such a merger might answer important questions that are impossible even to pose without experiential data aimed at particular moments of consciousness."
Here are two examples.
"First, Lara's inner speaking results show that (at least for Lara) there is a phenomenological distinction between innerly speaking one's voice and innerly hearing one's voice being spoken."
"To our knowledge, such a distinction is typically not attended to in contemporary models of inner speech ([@B13]; [@B49]), but it may be a crucial one for future studies."
"For example, theories of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) that emphasize monitoring of inner speech (e.g., [@B14]) may benefit from investigation of localizable differences between inner speaking and inner hearing."
"Also of interest was the relatively wider spread of activation associated with imagined inner speech (**Figure [1A](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}**) as compared to unprompted moments of inner speaking classified by the DES (**Figure [1B,D](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}**)."
"It must be borne in mind that these activation maps have differing levels of temporal precision in that the imagery data come from a block design (continually producing bits of inner speech over an extended period of time), whereas the DES samples, by their nature, are targeted at very specific moments."
"Nevertheless, one could speculate that these results reflect genuine differences---that is, when Lara is prompted to imagine speaking, her *actual* inner speaking is somewhat different (possibly dramatically different) from her naturally occurring inner speaking both phenomenologically and neurologically (see Hurlburt et al., in preparation)."
One interpretation is that Lara's actual experience following the inner speech prompt also included some processing of the prompt itself and some monitoring of inner speech production.
"It should be noted that prompted inner speech is an unnatural phenomenon ([@B36]), occurring very rarely outside of psychological research laboratories."
"However, nearly all psychological studies of inner speech are either retrospective or of the prompted variety."
"Given that this is a single case, we do not know whether distinctions such as between inner speaking and inner hearing and between prompted and unprompted inner speaking reflect idiosyncratic characteristics of Lara (and/or of RH) or are characteristic of other individuals who would regularly report inner speaking as part of their everyday experience."
"The present study cannot answer such questions, but it does provide a method whereby such questions might be answered."
"Furthermore, this study does not by itself establish a principle about introspections in general, because it investigated only one method (DES) and one investigator (RH)."
"For example, this study should *not* be understood as saying that we should simply believe people when they tell us they are talking to themselves; [@B25] holds that people are often substantially mistaken about such reports unless an adequate method is used."
"This study should *not* be understood as saying that questionnaires about experience or non-DES experience sampling are valid descriptors of experience ([@B31]; Alderson-Day et al., in preparation; Hurlburt et al., in preparation)."
"This study does not explore the boundaries or parameters of confidence in DES (or in RH)---that is, it does not characterize the situations where we can be more (or less) confident about the correspondence between self-reports and associated brain activity."
"However, this study does suggest a new set of opportunities for cognitive neuroscience investigations."
Most fMRI studies ask the participant in the scanner to perform a task that indirectly invokes a particular set of brain functions in the scanner.
"Whether receptive (e.g., merely viewing a flashing display) or active (e.g., memorizing syllables), the aim of those tasks is indirect in the sense that the task and stimuli are presumed to elicit the desired brain functions."
"That is, participants do not observe or report any aspect of their brain or mental function; they simply engage in the task that presumably indirectly evokes the brain function."
"As noted in the Introduction, some fMRI studies ask participants in the scanner directly to rate their cognition or mental activity on some predefined measure (e.g., [@B7])."
"But until now, no study has tried to link fMRI measurements to naturally occurring rather than task-elicited features of a participant's experiential phenomena in the scanner (Hurlburt et al., in preparation)."
"Now that we have established that such studies are possible, future investigations can explore the utility, limitations, and boundaries of such studies, for example comparing DES with other introspection methods and their correlation with brain activity."

The Department conducted an investigation of your allegation.
"As a result of the investigation, the Department has concluded that there was no violation of the LMRDA."
You allege that the election committee unfairly sought detailed information from candidate employer and also improperly communicated with ATU President Larry Hanley regarding nomination.
The investigation did not substantiate your allegation.
Section 401(e) of the LMRDA requires unions to hold covered elections in accordance with their validly adopted constitution and bylaws.
It also provides that every member in good standing shall be eligible to be a candidate and to hold office subject to “reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed.” see 29 C.F.R.
§ 452.2.
The Local 757 Bylaws require that candidates be on the payroll and drawing wages from a job covered by one of the Local’s collective bargaining agreements.
"At the time of nominations, was coded as a retiree in the union database that the Local used to verify candidates’ eligibility."
"As a result, the election committee sought more information on status, which provided in the form of a letter from MV Transportation affirming his employment as a part-time utility worker."
There is no evidence was unfairly singled out for a more rigorous review of his qualifications.
"Rather, the election committee co-chair, requested guidance from the international union on how to address the issue of eligibility."
The ATU international president responded with recommendations to the election committee as to what they should consider in making a determination.
"For the reasons set forth above, the Department has concluded that there was no violation of Title IV of the LMRDA that affected the outcome of the election, and we have closed the file in this matter."

The Department conducted an investigation of your allegations.
"As a result of the investigation, the Department has concluded that there was no violation of the LMRDA."
You allege that the union did not allow you to inspect the membership list before the election.
The Department’s investigation did not substantiate this claim.
Section 401(c) of the Act provides that a candidate has the right to inspect a list containing the names and last known addresses of all members once within 30 days prior to the election.
"The investigation found that no candidate, including you, requested to inspect the membership list."
"Further, the union provided candidates with an information packet at the nominations meeting which contained a letter notifying candidates of their right to inspect the membership list."
There was no violation of the LMRDA.
You also allege that a letter endorsing candidate Mary Longoria was: (1) prepared and signed by the executive board on union property; and (2) that Vice President Sam Schwarz and the executive board engaged in campaigning when they prepared the letter during a board meeting.
"Similarly you also allege that the retiree executive board used the union’s facilities to prepare, produce and mail its endorsement letter for Longoria."
Section 401(g) prohibits the use of employer and union funds to promote the candidacy of any person in an election covered by the LMRDA.
"In this case, the investigation did not substantiate your allegations."
"Rather, it found that there is no prohibition against campaigning at the union hall and no candidate was prohibited from doing so."
"Further, the investigation found that the 10 executive board members who signed the letter did
so during breaks or after the May 18, 2012 meeting and that executive board member paid for the letter and mailing."
"With regard to the retiree executive board, the investigation found that candidates and Longoria paid for the production and mailing of the retiree executive board endorsement letter."
"Further, the investigation found that the retiree executive board invited all at-large candidates to speak to the board but you declined the invitation."
There was no violation.
"Finally, you allege that the interval between the ballot mailing and the tally did not provide sufficient time for members to vote."
You further allege that the union delayed signing up 26 new hires until it was too late for them to vote.
Section 401(e) of the LMRDA requires that notice of the election must be mailed to each member at his last known address at least 15 days prior to the election and that every member in good standing is entitled to one vote and that those votes be counted.
The investigation did not substantiate your allegations.
"The investigation found that the union sent notice of the election to its members via its publication, Northwest Labor Press & The Bulletin, on May 4, 2012."
"The election contractor mailed the ballots on May 29, 2012 and the ballot tally was on June 15, 2012."
"Further, the investigation did not identify any member who did not vote because he or she did not have enough time."
"In addition, the investigation found that an employer notified the union on May 31, 2012, that 26 new hires would begin work June 4."
"Twenty-three (23) new hires eventually signed their dues deduction authorizations, but not in time to vote."
There is no evidence the new hires received anything other than routine treatment with regard to their applications and authorizations.
"For the reasons set forth above, the Department has concluded that there was no violation of Title IV of the LMRDA that affected the outcome of the election, and we have closed the file in this matter."
"Azure #CosmosDB – database for serverless era

Up until recently, software development has been revolving around the concept of a server."
"Provisioning, maintaining, and scaling applications has been something that developers needed to spend a lot of time and effort on."
We are now entering the era of serverless.
"With serverless architecture, there is a whole new range of applications emerging, in particular serverless event-driven apps."
"When the event is triggered, your application pops into action, does what it needs to do and disappears again."
"That’s why we start calling it “severless” because, in essence, your server does not exist until it is needed."
"As many of you know, Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed, massively scalable, multi-model database service."
"The service is designed to allow customers to elastically and horizontally scale both throughput and storage across any number of geographical regions, and it offers guaranteed <10 ms latencies at the 99th percentile, 99.99% high availability and five well defined consistency models to developers to make precise tradeoffs between performance, availability and consistency of data."
"Azure Cosmos DB is also the first globally distributed database service in the market today to offer comprehensive Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for throughput, latency, availability and consistency."
Today we are announcing the availability of native integration between Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Functions.
"With this native integration, you can create database triggers, input bindings, and output bindings directly from your Azure Cosmos DB account."
"Using Azure Functions and Azure Cosmos DB, you can create and deploy event-driven serverless apps with low-latency access to rich data for a global user base."
"Figure: Example of e-commerce serverless event-driven architecture

The beauty of this architecture is that

It lets you break down your system into smaller and simpler pieces that are easier to manage

It takes away the pain associated with running and maintaining servers to a point where developers can concentrate on their code instead of infrastructure."
"Simpler architecture is not only a lot more manageable, but is also a lot more economical to run."
Each function can be invoked separately when required and then disappear again leaving a much smaller resource footprint.
Another big advantage is that performance is enhanced due to code reusability.
"Azure Cosmos DB further powers the above architecture by making your massive and diverse data available close to where your users are, worldwide."
"Azure Cosmos DB – the database for all serverless apps

Azure Cosmos DB is the database of the future - it is what we believe is the next big thing in the world of massively scalable databases!"
"It is a globally distributed, multi-model database service for building planet scale apps with ease by using the API and data model of your choice."
"Azure Cosmos DB is the recommended database for all your serverless computing architectures for the following reasons:

Instant access to all your data: You have fine- granular access to every value stored because Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes all data by default, and makes those indexes immediately available."
"This means you are able to constinuously query, update, and add new items to your database and have instant access via Azure Functions."
Schema-less.
"Azure Cosmos DB is schema-less, so it's uniquely able to handle any data output from an Azure Function."
"This ""handle anything"" approach makes it straightforward to create a variety of Functions that all output to Azure Cosmos DB."
Scalable throughput.
Throughput can be scaled up and down instantly in Azure Cosmos DB.
"If you have hundreds or thousands of Functions querying and writing to the same collection, you can scale up your RU/s to handle the load."
All functions can work in parallel using your allocated RU/s and your data is guaranteed to be consistent.
Global replication.
"You can replicate Azure Cosmos DB data around the globe to reduce latency, geo-locating your data closest to where your users are."
"As with all Azure Cosmos DB queries, data from triggers is read from the Azure Cosmos DB closest to the region."
"What you can do with Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Functions Now

The native integration between Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Functions enable you to do the following:

You can create an Azure Cosmos DB trigger in an Azure Function."
This enables to build event-sourced and event-driven serverless apps with incredible ease.
This trigger relies on Change Feed streams to monitor your Azure Cosmos DB container for changes.
"When any changes are made to a container, the change feed stream is sent to the trigger, which invokes the Azure Function."
"For quickstart instructions, see Create an Azure Cosmos DB trigger in the Azure portal."
"Rich Event-Driven Serverless Apps, from retail to IoT, in minutes

The following use cases demonstrate a few ways you can make the most of your Azure Cosmos DB data - by connecting your data to event-driven Azure Functions."
"Retail: In retail implementations, when a user adds an item to their basket you now have the flexibility to create and invoke functions for optional business pipeline components."
"You can create an Azure Cosmos DB trigger by listening to the change feed, and be sure there won’t be any delay for critical order processing events in the process."
"Finance: In financial applications, you can invoke a function when a bank account balance falls below a certain threshold."
"Using a Timer trigger, you can retrieve the bank account balance information stored in an Azure Cosmos DB container using the input bindings."
"The timer can be set to a daily or weekly cadence, where the user can set a threshold for what would be considered as a low balance, then follow that with an action from the Azure Function."
"IoT: In an IoT application, e.g., a connected car scenario, you can use an Azure Cosmos DB trigger to trigger events related to car alerts, such as the check engine light coming on in a connected car."
"The trigger is invoked on every data-change to the sensor data collection and if a threshold condition is met, the function can send the sensor data to the warranty department."
Another function can be created to send the related owner information to a task that manages mailers related to car maintenance.
The output binding on one of the functions can update the car record in another Azure Cosmos DB container to store information about the check engine event.
"Games: In gaming, when a new user is created you can search for other users who might know them by using the Azure Cosmos DB Graph API."
You can then write the results to an Azure Cosmos DB database for easy retrieval.
"Using an Azure Cosmos DB graph database to store all users, you can create a new function with an Azure Cosmos DB trigger."
"Whenever a new user is inserted, the function is invoked, and then the result is stored using an output binding."
The function can query the graph database to search for all the users that are directly related to the new user and return that dataset to the function.
"This can then be stored in an Azure Cosmos DB Table database as a key-value set of pairs, which can then be easily retrieved by any front-end application that shows the new user their connected friends."
"Try Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Functions now

It is extremely easy to try out Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Functions – you can create Azure Cosmos DB triggers from the Azure Cosmos DB portal, or the Azure Functions portal by clicking Add > New Item >Azure Function."
The following image shows how to add an Azure Cosmos DB trigger to a function in the Azure Functions portal.
"Using Azure Functions and Azure Cosmos DB, you can create and deploy an event driven, serverless app to numerous datacenters across the world."
When Azure Functions are combined with a globally-distributed database like Azure Cosmos DB we can provide extremely low-latency access to data for a huge number of customers across the globe.

Axon regeneration in peripheral nerves is enhanced by exercise in the form of modest daily treadmill training.
This project will study three inter-related aspects of exercise as a potential therapy for treatment of peripheral nerve injuries to help move it closer to actual translation.
Marked sex differences in the efficacy of different training paradigms to promote axon regeneration exist and androgens are implicated in both sexes.
"In Aim 1, the androgen dependence of the effect of exercise will be studied in conditional androgen receptor knockout mice."
"The effects of different exercise paradigms on the lengths of regenerating axons, the numbers of neurons whose axons regenerate successfully, and the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, trkB, in motoneurons, dorsal root ganglion neurons, and growth cones of regenerating axons will be studied both in systemic and neuron-specific knockouts."
"As a therapy, different exercise paradigms will be needed for use when different nerves are injured."
Establishing guiding principles for their design will be important.
"The most obvious of these principles may be that the activity of neurons whose axons are regenerating is both necessary and sufficient for the enhancement of regeneration produced by the exercise, but this has not been studied in vivo."
"In the experiments in Aim 2, axotomized neurons will be activated directly using optogenetic technologies, to simulate their activity during treadmill training in male and female mice, and the sufficiency of this activation will be assayed by measuring the growth of regenerating axons and the expression of BDNF and trkB in neurons and growth cones."
"Using similar technologies in different mice, neuronal activity will be blocked during exercise and the effects assayed similarly to determine the requirement for activity for the effects of exercise."
Whether exercise or optical activation of neurons that results in enhanced axon regeneration also leads to improved functional recovery will be studied in Aim 3.
Nerve conduction studies will be used to monitor the time course of muscle reinnervation and H reflex restoration in exercised mice and optically activated mice.
Kinematic analyses of limb movements during walking on different slopes will be used to measure these effects on functional recovery behaviorally Effects of sex and training/activation paradigm will be studied separately.
This potential therapeutic use of exercise addresses an important public health issue.
It is low-tech and requires only modest supervision by skilled practitioners.
Patients can assume a lot of the responsibility for their own functional recovery.
At the end of this study we will have acquired evidence in support of three significant aspects of the efficacy of exercise that will add to its translational promise.

============

*S. pyogenes* is an important human pathogen causing an estimated 500,000 deaths yearly [@pone.0035218-Carapetis1]."
"The bacterium is associated with a wide disease spectrum ranging from mild infections of the skin and mucosa such as impetigo and tonsillitis [@pone.0035218-Cunningham1] to severe invasive infections associated with high mortality, such as toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing faciitis [@pone.0035218-Olsen1], [@pone.0035218-Johansson1]."
"Although *S. pyogenes* is often found extracellulary in the host, we and others have demonstrated that the pathogen can reside intracellularly and circumvent bacterial killing in both human macrophages [@pone.0035218-Thulin1], [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1] and neutrophils [@pone.0035218-Staali1], [@pone.0035218-Staali2]."
"In macrophages, *S. pyogenes* resides within phagocytic vacuoles that not only serve as safe-havens but also niches for replication [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1]; thereby contributing to bacterial persistence during invasive infection."
"In these phagocytic cells, the bacterial surface anchored M protein was recognized as an important factor contributing to *S. pyogenes* intracellular survival [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1], [@pone.0035218-Staali1]."
"During the infection process, it is of importance for bacteria to efficiently adapt to the changing environments within the host."
Pathogenic bacteria have been shown to employ various mechanisms to fine-tune expression of virulence factors in response to growth conditions and stresses encountered in different niches and stages of infection [@pone.0035218-Kreikemeyer1].
"Normally, a distinct set of virulence factors are expressed during each stage of infection, many of which are regulated by TCSs."
"The TCSs generally consist of a sensory and a regulatory component where the sensor component is typically a transmembrane histidine kinase that recognizes one or more environmental signals, such as changes in ion concentration, osmotic pressure or pH [@pone.0035218-Stock1]."
"The majority of response regulator are cytoplasmic transcription factors that may either repress or activate transcription of target genes [@pone.0035218-Kreikemeyer1], [@pone.0035218-Stock1]."
"In *S. pyogenes*, 13 different TCSs have been mapped, out of which 4 have been studied in more detail: CovR/S, FasBCAX, SptR/S and Ihk/Irr."
"The best characterized is the [c]{.ul}ontrol [o]{.ul}f [v]{.ul}irulence (CovR/S) system, also known as CsrR/S [@pone.0035218-Levin1], [@pone.0035218-Federle1]."
"CovR/S affects around 15% of the bacterial genome and acts primarily by repressing transcription of virulence factors such as the hyaluronic acid capsule, streptokinase, streptolysins O and S, and cysteine protease Mac/IdeS [@pone.0035218-Federle1]--[@pone.0035218-Kansal1]."
"Recently, CovR/S has received considerable attention due to the emergence of specific hyper-virulent streptococcal strains associated with *in vivo* selection of mutations in *covS* [@pone.0035218-Kansal1]--[@pone.0035218-Hollands1]."
"FasBCAX regulates fibronectin/fibrinogen binding, hemolytic activity and streptokinase transcription [@pone.0035218-Kreikemeyer2], SptR/S has been shown to be important for the persistence of *S. pyogenes* in human saliva [@pone.0035218-Shelburne1] and the Ihk/Irr was recently reported to be important for *S. pyogenes* resistance to neutrophil killing [@pone.0035218-Voyich1]."
"Once inside the cell, bacterial survival and replication depend on significant metabolic adaptation, so that available nutrients can be efficiently utilized."
"As human bacterial pathogens are heterotrophs, there is a constant need for carbon inside the cell to serve as energy sources and as substrates for the production of the different macromolecules, such as protein and cell envelope components utilized by the pathogen."
"The major carbon and nitrogen substrates are normally transported by specialized pathways and uptake systems, such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and phosphotransferase systems (reviewed in [@pone.0035218-Eisenreich1])."
"In *S. pyogenes* (strain SF370), 36 ABC transporters have been identified, and their functions suggested to be associated with systems regulating transport of iron, phosphate, inorganic ions, sugars, dipeptides/oligopeptides and amino acids [@pone.0035218-Ferretti1]."
We have previously shown that *S. pyogenes* can survive inside human macrophages through M protein dependent inhibition of phagosomal maturation [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1].
"In the present study, we sought to identify bacterial genes involved during early stages of intracellular persistence in macrophages, i.e."
the primary host cell harboring *S. pyogenes* at the tissue site of infection [@pone.0035218-Thulin1].
Using microarrays we established the gene expression profile of intracellular *S. pyogenes* in human macrophages.
Our results revealed a differential gene expression profile with 145 altered genes in intracellular as compared to extracellular bacteria.
"Notably, we observed significant up-regulation of the *ihk/irr* TCS in intracellular *S. pyogenes* at the early phase of infection."
Our results suggest a multifaceted bacterial adaptation to the intracellular environment in macrophages.

Differential Gene Expression Patterns between Intracellular and Extracellular Bacteria {#s2a}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The infectious cycle of bacteria within host cells involves several distinct phases, where each phase is likely to be associated with specific gene expression profiles [@pone.0035218-Aziz1]."
Here we aim to model the early adaptive phase that is required to support intracellular survival.
"For this purpose, bacterial transcriptome profiles were determined 2h post-infection (pi) of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages."
"Only intracellular bacteria were taken into account, as extracellular or adherent bacteria were killed off by antibiotics."
"All infections were done with the clinical *S. pyogenes* 5448 isolate of the M1T1 serotype, previously well-characterized with respect to intracellular trafficking and survival in macrophages [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1]."
Extracellular control bacteria were cultured without cells under identical growth conditions.
"Bacterial RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA and hybridized to customized microarrays of printed oligonucleotides [@pone.0035218-Aziz1], [@pone.0035218-Kansal1]."
We observed stark differences in gene expression profiles of intracellular bacteria when compared to extracellular bacteria with 145 genes having a significantly altered expression (*P* \< 0.05) ([Fig.
"1A](#pone-0035218-g001){ref-type=""fig""})."
The majority of the up-regulated genes in intracellular bacteria were involved in cell wall synthesis and energy production ([Fig.
"1B](#pone-0035218-g001){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Phage-encoded genes is another category in which many genes were found to be up-regulated, some as high as 50-fold."
"The genes were associated with different prophages, including Ф70.1, Ф370.2 and Ф370.3."
"The two most strongly up-regulated were Spy0676 and Spy0698 (20 and 50-fold, respectively), both associated with Ф370.1."
"These genes, as well as most of the other deregulated phage-associated genes, encoded for hypothetical proteins with unknown function."
"The phage-encoded category also included a transcriptional repressor, which was down-regulated 4-fold."
"In contrast, genes associated with nucleotide metabolism, transcription and oxidative stress were in general down-regulated in intracellular *S. pyogenes* when compared to extracellular bacteria ([Fig."
"1B](#pone-0035218-g001){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Other functional categories such general metabolism, protein synthesis and transporters varied greatly and no trend of up- or down-regulation could be seen observed ([Fig 1B](#pone-0035218-g001){ref-type=""fig""})."
"However, some genes were clearly differentially expressed."
"These include the ABC transporters (Spy2032/2033 and Spy0385), which are of importance for efficient metabolism due to their involvement in import and export of nutrients as well as in transport of ions."
Our microarray data revealed an 8-fold up-regulated activity of an ABC transporter (Spy 2032/2033) and of the iron ABC transporter (Spy0385) ([Fig.
"2A](#pone-0035218-g002){ref-type=""fig""})."
Another interesting finding was that the TCS *ihk/irr* genes (Spy2026/2027) were respectively 7- and 3-fold up-regulated in intracellular *S. pyogenes* ([Fig.
"2A](#pone-0035218-g002){ref-type=""fig""})."
"To validate these data, new infection assays were performed from which RNA was extracted and analyzed for selected genes using TaqMan qRT-PCR."
"In agreement with the previous result, *ihk/irr* genes and the ABC transporters all showed marked up-regulated expression ranging between 8--14-fold in intracellular when compared to extracellular bacteria ([Fig."
"2B](#pone-0035218-g002){ref-type=""fig""})."

The Ihk/Irr TCS has previously been reported to influence expression of 351 genes, as identified by microarray analyses of wildtype and *irr*-deficient *S. pyogenes* mutant strains [@pone.0035218-Voyich2]."
"Here we find that 22 of the 145 differentially expressed genes in intracellular *S. pyogenes* 2h pi are among the Ihk/Irr regulated genes ([Table 1](#pone-0035218-t001){ref-type=""table""})."
"Several of these genes did not have the same regulatory pattern (up-- or down-regulation), which is not surprising considering the large variation seen between early and late exponential phase, as reported by Voyich et al [@pone.0035218-Voyich2]."
"However, 9 genes did show the same regulatory pattern, most being identified during the early exponential phase and involved in biosynthesis or metabolism ([Table 1](#pone-0035218-t001){ref-type=""table""})."

"Fine-tuned Gene Regulation through Temporal Expression of TCSs During the Infectious Cycle {#s2b}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gene expression data, together with the fact that TCSs are commonly involved in bacterial adaptation to environmental stimuli, suggests a role for Ihk/Irr in the early adaptive phase of *S. pyogenes* to the macrophage intracellular environment."
"Our recent study [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1] demonstrated that at later time-points, following a replicative phase, *S. pyogenes* egress out of the cells, at which point they are fit to infect new cells."
"Thus at this point, the bacteria must be equipped with appropriate virulence factors for infectivity."
It seems unlikely that the Ihk/Irr would also support the later phases of infections considering that only few virulence genes has been reported to be regulated by Ihk/Irr.
"To test this, the gene expression experiments were extended to include a 6h time point, representing a late phase of macrophage intracellular infection."
"In addition to *ihk/irr*, the *emm*1 gene and the TCS CovR/S were selected for the analyses."
"The latter is a negative response regulator of many streptococcal factors including the capsule, which confers anti-phagocytic activity."
Real-time qRT-PCR analysis revealed a pronounced shift between the two TCSs over time ([Fig.
"3A and B](#pone-0035218-g003){ref-type=""fig""})."
"During the early adaptation phase, both *ihk* and *irr* genes are highly up-regulated but their expression decreases as the infection proceeds."
"In contrast, *cov*R and *cov*S genes were markedly up-regulated at 6h when compared to 2h pi."
"Interestingly, the highest expression of *ihk/irr* was seen at 2h pi, whereas at 1h pi the levels were lower, although not as low as at 6h pi (3D)."
"As we are using an infection model without centrifugation, bacterial uptake occurs over an extended period, which results in a heterogeneous intracellular bacterial population with respect to the stage/phase of infection."
"Thus, samples at 1h pi are likely to include a substantial portion of bacteria that have just entered and not yet adapted to the intracellular environment."
This in turn could explain differences in gene expression between 1h and 2h pi.
"In line with this reasoning, expression of *cov*R/S varied greatly between donors (3E)."
"This temporal transition from Ihk/Irr to CovR/S is consistent with our hypothesis that the gene expression reverts from an adaptive/replicative profile to a profile that can promote bacteria-mediated cell lysis, infectivity and further dissemination of infection."
"To further support this, we analyzed the expression of the *has*A gene encoding for the anti-phagocytic hyaluronic acid capsule, which is one of the major genes suppressed by the CovR/S TCS [@pone.0035218-Levin2]."
"qRT-PCR analyses showed that in 2 out of 3 experiments performed, the *has*A gene was 8- to 4-fold down-regulated at 6h pi, whereas in one experiment it remained unaltered."
"Although not under the control of either Ihk/Irr or CovR/S, another gene of interest is the *emm*1 gene, due to its previously shown importance for intracellular survival [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1]."
Our microarray data from the 2h infected cultures did not reveal a deregulated expression.
"However, qRT-PCR analyses showed in average a 2-fold increase in expression of the *emm*1 gene in bacteria recovered 6h pi when compared to 2h pi (p  =  0.03)([Fig."
"3C](#pone-0035218-g003){ref-type=""fig""})."

To functionally assess whether these differences in gene expression between 2h and 6h makes the strains more fit to egress and infect new cells, a re-infection assay was established in which bacteria were collected from cells infected for 2h and 6h pi."
The recovered bacteria were then allowed to re-infect new cells for 2h after which intracellular bacterial load was determined.
"In line with our hypothesis, data from two separate experiments revealed markedly higher bacterial load in cells infected with bacteria recovered from 6h pi when compared to bacteria from 2h pi cultures ([Fig."

"Importance of Ihk/Irr in Intracellular *S. pyogenes* {#s2c}
----------------------------------------------------

To further test whether Ihk/Irr contribute to intracellular survival of *S. pyogenes* in human macrophages, an isogenic *ihk/irr*-deficient mutant (Δihk/irr 5448) was generated and its intracellular survival was compared to that of the wild-type (WT) parent strain ([Fig."
"4](#pone-0035218-g004){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Infection frequency was assessed by lysis of infected cells and enumeration of colony forming units (CFU), as well as by microscopic assessment of the percentage of cells harboring viable bacteria."
"The results revealed that infection with the Δihk/irr 5448 was associated with somewhat lower intracellular bacterial counts ([Fig 4A](#pone-0035218-g004){ref-type=""fig""}), as well as lower % of infected cells at 4h pi, when compared to the wt 5448 ([Fig 4B](#pone-0035218-g004){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Two donors were monitored over time (4--8h) for % infected cells and corroborating our previous data with respect to wt 5448 [@pone.0035218-Thulin1], the frequency of infected cells decreases over time, while no differences between Δihk/irr and wt 5448 infected cells could be observed (data not shown)."
Cell viability was assessed by flow cytometry through staining with a membrane impermeable dead cell marker.
"Our results reveal that *S. pyogenes* infection results in 6--12% cell death, as compared to 2--4% for uninfected cells ([Fig 4C](#pone-0035218-g004){ref-type=""fig""})."
"Importantly, there were no differences in cellular death between cells infected with either strain ([Fig."

Discussion {#s3}
==========

*S. pyogenes* is a versatile and efficient colonizer of many environments by virtue of its sophisticated ability to adapt to the changing milieu both with respect to metabolic processes and virulence profile [@pone.0035218-Kreikemeyer1], [@pone.0035218-Shelburne2]."
Here we focus on transition of *S. pyogenes* from an extracellular to an intracellular pathogen in human macrophages and we demonstrate that 145 genes are differentially transcribed during the early adaptation phase.
Many of the up-regulated genes have established functions in cell wall synthesis and metabolism.
"As such they include several ABC transporters, which can contribute to bacterial metabolism and virulence through import/export of ions and nutrients [@pone.0035218-Davidson1]."
"Among the transporter genes, the ABC transporter system Spy2032/2033 demonstrated the highest up-regulation (8- and 14-fold in microarray and qRT-PCR analyses, respectively) in intracellular when compared to extracellular bacteria."
"Interestingly, these genes were also found to be up-regulated during infection in human whole blood [@pone.0035218-Graham1] and thus seem to be important during *S. pyogenes* infections in humans."
"Considering that many important virulence factors are associated with mobile genetic elements [@pone.0035218-Brussow1], it was noteworthy that many of the phage-encoded genes were up-regulated in intracellular bacteria."
"Most of these deregulated phage-encoded genes encoded for hypothetical proteins with unknown functions, and none of the classical phage-encoded virulence factors, such as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (Spe) A, SpeC, and DNases (Streptodornase and mitogenic factors), were identified."
"The importance of prophages in the evolution of diversification and emergence of hyper-virulent streptococcal clones is well recognized [@pone.0035218-Beres1], [@pone.0035218-Aziz2]."
Aziz et al [@pone.0035218-Aziz2] compared the hyper-virulent M1T1 5448 strain (i.e.
same strain as in present study) with the laboratory reference M1T1 strain SF370.
"The analyses revealed that the two strains share a 95% homology, and notably the majority of the differential 5% consists of phage related sequences being present in the hyper-virulent clinical M1T1 isolate [@pone.0035218-Aziz2]."
A major finding of our microarray analysis was the up-regulation of genes encoding the TCS Ihk/Irr during the early phase (i.e.
"2h) of infection, indicating that this TCS influences gene expression supporting intracellular bacterial persistence in macrophages."
The Ihk/Irr system was first discovered by Federle et al [@pone.0035218-Federle1] as a TCS with homology to the PhoPS response regulator in *Bacillus subtilis* [@pone.0035218-Hulett1].
"The PhoPS system is widely distributed among bacterial species and is involved in regulating virulence factors through sensing of the phosphate concentration in the surrounding environment, including intracellular survival of *Salmonella ssp., Enterococcus faecalis* and *Listeria monocytogenes* in macrophages [@pone.0035218-Lamarche1]--[@pone.0035218-Cotter1]."
"qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated a temporal expression of TCSs, evident by a down-regulation of the *ihk/irr* genes as the infection proceeds, while the TCS *cov*R*/cov*S genes are up-regulated at 6h compared to 2h pi."
"In contrast, gene expression of *ihk/irr* at 1h pi was lower than at 2h pi."
This is likely a consequence of the fact that our infection model does not employ centrifugation but allows a more physiologic prolonged bacterial uptake process.
"As a result, samples from the 1h time point represent a diverse bacterial population as the cells are likely to contain bacteria that have been intracellular for various periods of time ranging from 10 minutes to 1h."
"Taken together, our findings suggest that there is a fine-tuned gene regulation during the different phases of infection with activation of Ihk/Irr during the early adaptation phase."
At later phases of infection the bacteria egress out of the cells and prepare to infect new cells.
"This in turn requires another gene expression profile, potentially influenced by CovR/S."
Regulation of gene expression by CovR/S is complex.
"Whereas it is considered a negative response regulator that turns off expression of virulence genes, certain mutations in CovS have been associated with up-regulation of certain CovR regulated genes."
A major target of the CovR repressor is the anti-phagocytic hyaluronic acid capsule.
"Acapsular variants have previously been shown to be more efficient in adherence to and entry into cells [@pone.0035218-Schrager1], [@pone.0035218-Schrager2]."
"In line with this reasoning, analyses of expression of the *has*A gene indicated a down-regulation at the 6h time point."
"Also the M-protein, which is not directly regulated by CovR/S but has been strongly implicated as a key factor for survival in phagocytic cells, showed an upregulated gene expression at 6h pi."
"To test whether these noted differences in gene expression translate into differential infectivity, bacteria recovered at early (2h) and later (6h) stages of infection were used in a re-infection assay."
"Indeed, bacteria from the 6h cultures (associated with low capsule and higher *emm*1 expression) were found to be more infectious than those recovered during early stages (2h pi)."
Further support for a role of Ihk/Irr for intracellular *S. pyogenes* in macrophages was sought by generating an isogenic *ihk/irr* deficient mutant and comparing its survival to that of the wt strain.
"A slight but significant reduction in intracellular bacterial counts, % infected cells, as well as lower bacterial counts recovered in antibiotic-free media after infection were observed following infection with the mutant when compared to the wt strain."
"Ihk/Irr has previously been reported to be involved in *S. pyogenes* resistance to phagocytic killing in human neutrophils by conferring resistance to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides [@pone.0035218-Voyich1], [@pone.0035218-Voyich2]."
Other investigations involving *in vivo* studies of *S. pyogenes* in a mouse model [@pone.0035218-Graham2] and an *in vitro* system with human whole blood [@pone.0035218-Graham1] or saliva (14) have reported an activation of this system during infection.
"In contrast to the noted association between Ihk/Irr and resistance to reactive oxygen species in neutrophils [@pone.0035218-Voyich1], we found that oxidative stress response genes were down-regulated at 2h pi in macrophages."
"One plausible explanation to our results is that *S. pyogenes* survival in macrophages is critically associated with an arrest in phagolysosomal maturation [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1], which likely limits exposure to reactive oxygen species and thereby, the induction of oxidative stress responses."
"Another contributing factor could be differences between serotypes, as the functional studies in neutrophils were done using an M6 *S. pyogenes* strain in contrast to M1 used in this study."
"Thus, the exact function of Ihk/Irr intracellularly and in different serotypes remains to be defined in future studies."
"Materials and Methods {#s4}
=====================

Ethics Statement {#s4a}
----------------

This study includes blood samples from healthy volunteers or buffy coats of blood provided by the blood bank at the Karolinska University Hospital."
The buffy coats were provided anonymously; hence informed consent was not required.
"In case of healthy volunteers, donors were individuals well acquainted with the research conducted; thus, verbal informed consent was deemed sufficient and was documented in laboratory journals."
The ethical research committee at Huddinge University Hospital (Forskningskommitté Syd) approved the study including this consent procedure.
"Primary Human Cell Preparation and Culture Conditions {#s4b}
-----------------------------------------------------

Human monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared from healthy blood donors essentially as described [@pone.0035218-Hertzn1]."
"Briefly, monocytes were isolated from buffy coats using RosetteSep (Stemcell Technologies) separation followed by a Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) centrifugation step."
"Monocytes were then seeded in 6-well low-adherence cell culture plates (Corning) in RPMI containing 10% FCS and 50 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Immunotools), and cultured for 5--7 days to obtain macrophages."
"Bacterial Strains {#s4c}
-----------------

A clinical M1T1 isolate of *S. pyogenes* (strain 5448) (36) and the isogenic mutant 5448Δ*ihk-irr* were grown at 37°C to stationary phase in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 1.5% yeast extract and diluted to the required inoculum depending on experimental assay."
The two strains had equal growth rates.
"Generation of *ihk-irr* Allelic Replacement Mutant {#s4d}
--------------------------------------------------

The isogenic mutant 5448Δ*ihk-irr* was constructed by an allelic exchange mutagenesis procedure developed for *S. pyogenes* [@pone.0035218-Buchanan1]."
"Briefly, DNA sequences encoding ∼1 kb upstream and ∼1 kb downstream of the target genes were amplified from the M1T1 GAS 5448 chromosome using *PfuUltra*® II (Stratagene) and the following primer pairs: (a) Ihk-Irr-UpFwd (5′-Cga[ctcgag]{.ul}gaagtgatgggaaatcccttcaggg-3′) + Ihk-Irr- UpRev (5′-cca gtgatttttttctccaTaacttccctttctagattggcg -3′ with 20 bp 5′ extension matching the 5′ end of *cat* gene); (b) Ihk-Irr-DownF (5′-tggcagggcggggcgtaatccatactagtaggacgacaaaagtc-3′ with 19 bp 5′ extension matching 3′ end of *cat* gene) + Ihk-Irr-DownR (5′-cga[gaattc]{.ul}cccataacggcgtgacaacaggttg-3′)."
The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (*cat*) was amplified from plasmid pACYC184 using primers Cat-For (5′-atggagaaaaaaatcactggatatacc-3′) and Cat-Rev (5′-ttacgccccgccctgccactcatcgca-3′).
"Fusion PCR was performed with the Failsafe enzyme (Epicenter), the Ihk-Irr-Up-Fwd and Ihk-Irr-Down-Rev primers, and the three above-mentioned amplicons, to generate a PCR product in which *cat* precisely replaced Ihk-Irr in the GAS chromosomal context."
The fusion construct was subcloned into temperature-sensitive plasmid pHY304 that carries an erythromycin-resistance (Em^R^) marker.
"The knockout plasmid was transformed into 5448 WT with selection for Em^R^ (2μg/ml) at the permissive temperature (30°C), then single-crossover events identified after shifting the culture to the non-permissive temperature (37°C) maintaining Em selection."
"The culture was relaxed by serial passage at 30°C without antibiotics, and the double-crossover event identified by screening for colonies with a Cm^R\ +^ Em^S^ phenotype at 37°C."
The precise in-frame allelic replacement of *ihk-irr* with *cat* in the *S. pyogenes* 5448 chromosome was confirmed by PCR and sequence analyses.
"Infection Assay {#s4e}
---------------

Briefly, *S. pyogenes* were co-cultured with macrophages at 37°C and 5% CO~2~ for different time points."
A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5--20 CFU/cell was used depending on the assay.
"At 1 h after infection, extracellular and adherent bacteria were killed by addition of 125 μg/ml gentamicin and 2.5 μg/ml penicillin G for 1 h, followed by washing in PBS twice, and addition of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 μg/ml penicillin G throughout the rest of the experiment."
"Expression Microarray Analysis {#s4f}
------------------------------

For comprehensive transcriptome analysis, oligonucleotides were spotted on glass microarrays (Microarrays, Inc.), representing all 2,346 open reading frames of the M1T1, strain SF370 of *S. pyogenes* [@pone.0035218-Ferretti1] (GenBank accession \#NC_002737), using oligo sets designed and provided by Drs."
"J. Scott and K. McIver, with additional open reading frames (mainly phage encoded) from strains MGAS8232 (GenBank accession\# NC_003485) and MGAS315 (GenBank accession \# NC_004070) [@pone.0035218-Aziz1], [@pone.0035218-Kansal1]."
Each open reading frame was spotted in triplicates.
RNA was extracted from intracellular bacteria (2h pi) using the Ribopure Bacteria kit (Ambion).
"Extracellular control bacteria were grown under identical settings, i.e."
"6 well low-adherence plates, 37^o^C, 5% CO~2~, in cell culture media lacking cells and RNA was isolated as described above."
Purified RNA was reversely transcribed into complementary DNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and labeled with Alexa Fluor 546/647 by using a 3DNA Array 900 MPX kit (Genisphere).
RNA was isolated from 3 biological replicas.
The microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B scanner and primary analyses were performed using GenePixPro software (version 4.0; Axon Instruments).
"The analyses included spot finding, alignment and adjustment, fluorescence normalization, flagging of poorly hybridized spots and background subtraction."
Subsequent analyses were done using GeneSpring GX software (version7.3; Agilent technologies).
"To compare gene expression profiles of the two groups, GeneSpring's parametric test was used and unequal variance was assumed."
Microarray data validation was conducted using qRT-PCR.
All raw microarray data was submitted to NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in accordance with MIAME standards (GEO accession numbers: GEO platform GPL14578 and samples GSM796440--41).
"Reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR {#s4g}
------------------------------

Real-time qRT-PCR analyses were conducted to validate microarray data and to obtain data on gene expression at 1h, 2h and 6h pi."
"RNA from intracellular and extracellular bacteria was extracted as described above, including a DNase step to secure removement of contaminating genomic DNA."
RNA was then reversely transcribed using Quantitech reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) including control reactions without the RT enzyme to control for gDNA traces.
"Primers and TaqMan probes were designed using the PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems), shown in [table S1](#pone.0035218.s001){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}."
qPCR reaction was performed in the 7500 Fast system using 2x Gene Expression Master Mix (both from Applied Biosystems) and in accordance with provided protocols.
Control experiments were performed with host cell cDNA to ensure no cross-reactivity of contaminating eukaryotic RNA with the prokaryotic target genes.
The experiment was done with 3--6 biological replicates.
Results from well triplicates were pooled and analyzed using the ΔΔCt method with extracellular *S. pyogenes* samples as calibrator and gyrase as endogenous control in MS Excel.
"Re-infection Assay {#s4h}
------------------

1×10^6^ macrophages were seeded/well in 6-well plates and infected for 1 hour with a MOI of 20 CFU/cell followed by antibiotic killing of extracellular bacteria for 1 hour as described above."
"After 2 hours and 6 hours, cells were washed twice with PBS where after cells were lysed with ddH~2~O (pH 11)."
The lysate was added to 5×10^4^ macrophages in a 48 well plate (duplicates).
The lysate was also plated on blood agar plates to confirm an equal MOI between the two strains.
After 2 hours of infection cells were lysed as previously described and bacterial content was quantified by plating lysates on blood agar plates.
"Lysis Assay {#s4i}
-----------

1×10^5^ macrophages were seeded in 24-well plates and infected for 1 hours with a MOI of 4--8 CFU/cell followed by antibiotic killing of extracellular bacteria for 1 hour."
Cells were then washed 3 three times with PBS and lysed with ddH~2~O (pH 11).
The lysate was plated on blood agar plates and bacterial content was quantified by counting colony-forming units.
"Quantification of Infected Cells with LIVE/DEAD Bacterial Viability Kit {#s4j}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1×10^5^ macrophages were seeded/well on cover slips in a 24-well plate."
Cells were infected with *S. pyogenes* with a MOI of 10 CFU/cell for 2 hours after which antibiotics was added as described above.
"To detect intracellular bacteria, cells were incubated with LIVE/DEAD Backlight Bacterial viability kit (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes), which enables discrimination between viable and dead bacteria, in accordance with provided protocol."
The number of cells harbouring \> 2 viable bacteria was enumerated by microscopy analysis.
"Flow Cytometry {#s4k}
--------------

*S. pyogenes* were co-cultured with macrophages at 37°C and 5% CO~2~ for different time points."
A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 CFU/cell was used.
"At 1h post infection, extracellular and adherent bacteria were killed by addition of 1 µg/ml penicillin G into the supernating medium."
"At 2h, 6h and 8h post-infection, macrophages were harvested and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's specifications."
A positive control was included consisting of cells treated with 50% DMSO.
1×10^5^ cells were acquired using an LSRFortessa (BD) cell analyzer and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star) software.
"Exit-assay {#s4l}
----------

1×10^5^ macrophages were seeded/well in a 24-well plate."
Cells were infected with a MOI of 5 CFU/cell for 2 hours.
Extracellular bacteria were eradicated by adding antibiotics as described for the infection assay above.
"After 4 hours of infection, cells were washed three times to remove antibiotics and antibiotic-free media was added."
Cells were further incubated and at specific time points the amount of egressed bacteria was enumerated by plating samples of media.

"Castlepoint Station

Castlepoint Station is a coastal 2995 ha property on the Wairarapa coast."
"Owned by Anders and Emily Crofoot and managed by Tom Bush, the property has an annual rainfall of 970 mm and regularly suffers from periods of severe summer drought."
"In the autumn of 2013, two trials were established to evaluate the role annual legumes could play on dry hill country."
Both sites were established by oversowing.
"In the first, a 10 ha paddock containing a wide range of aspects and slopes was oversown with a range of clovers (Arrowleaf, Red, Balansa, Persian, White) plus ‘Tonic’ plantain following summer fallow."
"In the second, two paddocks (17 & 11 ha) were oversown with Arrowleaf, Balansa, Persian and Gland clover."
Plant establishment and animal performance is being monitored.
Full details and results to date are available in the Hub Group notes.

How to check the word in an array

I have a default array for example
a=[""and"",""a"",""in"",""&""] etc...

Iam getting a dynamic text, which iam converting it into an array."
for example.
"b=[""harry"",""in"",""connect""]

I need to highlight by avoiding ""in"" the array."
So harry and connect will be highlight but not the in?
How to compare or check the array in jquery?
"A:

you can use $.inArray or $.grep, i.e."
"var a=[""and"",""a"",""in"",""&""];
var b=[""harry"",""in"",""connect""];

var c = $.grep(b, function(n){
    return $.inArray(n,a) == -1;
});

This will return a new array, containing only the words NOT present in array a
Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kaFvw/
If you need it to return an array with all the words PRESENT in array a, just change the == operator to !="

"Behind the badge series: Firefighters become family (Video)

By

March 14, 2013 at midnightUpdated March 16, 2013 at 10:17 p.m."
Firefighters bring out engines to check them over at Fire Station 4 in Victoria.
"KATHLEEN DUNCAN / KDUNCAN@VICAD.COM

By 7 a.m. sharp, the men are sweeping, wiping down counters, mowing the lawn, starting laundry, cleaning trucks and working on paperwork."
"By about 8:30 a.m., their kitchen chairs are moved back onto the freshly mopped floor and they sit down for a quick breakfast."
"""Who hid the cinnamon?"""
"questioned firefighter engineer Chris Thompson as he rummaged through the large pantry, pushing past the big bag of sugars and other spices."
"""I couldn't find it either,"" replied Capt."
"Mike Baecker, sitting down with his own breakfast at the large, wooden table."
"Next to Baecker, another firefighter used the short break to quietly polish his black uniform boots."
"Thompson, finally locating the missing cinnamon, set his steaming hot oatmeal on the table."
"But then the tones sound and the red lights in Victoria Fire Station 4 start flashing - conversation stops and the chairs scrape back, the oatmeal left on the counter, as the men jump up and run outside."
"From the time the alarms sound, they have six minutes to get to the scene, although the average time is under five minutes, said Victoria Fire Chief Taner Drake."
"In the coming moments - whether they are responding to a house fire, a wreck with injuries or even a swift-water rescue - there is little need for words."
"""From cleaning the kitchen to washing the trucks, you get used to doing things together all the time,"" firefighter Joel Aguirre said."
"""And when you are on scene and things are getting crazy, you have to rely on each other, you have to know who you are dealing with - know their weaknesses and strengths."
"It all matters in the end."""
"Each member of the shift knows what to do and does it - a skill that is especially useful when they are working in a burning house, Thompson said, and can't speak."
"""A lot of people refer to it as a brotherhood, but they don't understand it,"" Thompson said."
"""I spend more time with these guys than I do with my family."""
"Working shifts of 24 hours on and 48 hours off, many of the men and women also work part-time jobs to help supplement their income, Drake said."
"Thompson, for example, works in the oil field services industry on his days off."
"That leaves little time for family, he said, and is a sacrifice his children don't always understand."
"Which is maybe why, at the station, the firefighters become more like family than co-workers, as they cook, clean, sleep, laugh and even play together."
"And in some ways, the bonds go even deeper than family, Baecker said, because they work daily together in life or death scenarios."
"""I've fallen through floors and stuff like that and my concern was, if I'm with Russell (Chambers), it's like, 'Man I've got to get up because Russell is trying to pull the hose by himself.'"
"I'm not usually worried about what's happening to me,"" Baecker said."
"So he lifts himself and the 60 pounds of gear out of the burning floor, grabs the fire hose to help support the thousands of pounds of pressure, and keeps walking."
"Baecker, who has been with the department for nearly 30 years, has faced many deadly scenarios, but said he wouldn't consider changing his profession."
"Battling one fire, Baecker said, he was sure he was going to die."
"""The concrete wall was falling out and we were trying to get out of the way."
It broke in half right before it got to us.
The rest of the wall fell out and that part fell in.
"That's when I determined I wasn't fast enough to get out of the way of a building that's falling down,"" Baecker described, shrugging and laughing at his joke."
"Thompson, also nodding his head and grinning, said one way firefighters cope with the trauma they experience is through jokes."
"""About the only time we see people is at their worst times in their life - their house just burned down, they are in a car wreck, mom just had a heart attack."
"Some people will shut down and just keep to themselves, other people will talk about it."""
"Thompson said of how firefighters cope, adding everyone has their own way of coping."
Drake said the department offers chaplains and counseling for firefighters as well.
"""Having been there and been frustrated by not being able to take anything positive from a scene - they aren't robots."
They are humans.
"It breaks their hearts to see that,"" Drake said."
"But even if they can't shield themselves, Baecker said, they do protect their families from the horrors they see daily."
He said he rarely shares the traumatic calls with his wife.
"In addition, Drake said the smaller departments, such as Victoria, also struggle with staffing."
"A larger city will battle a house fire with about 50 firefighters, Drake said, while Victoria's average at a fire is only 13."
"""These guys, they have their hands full."
"They have a lot of tasks they have to do, whereas in a larger city, they can be task-specific,"" Drake said, saying the men and women are cross-trained and most of them are trained as both emergency medical technicians and firefighters."
"Being responsible for saving lives forces people, especially new firefighters, to grow up, Drake said, adding he matured fast when he took the job in Odessa more than 20 years ago."
But it is not always serious.
"The dorm-style living in the stations, however, also encourages practical jokes and pranks, Baecker said."
"""In other ways, it's like being in junior high again,"" Baecker said, smiling."
"The other firefighters, eating their fish taco dinner, laughed, excited that they get to work with big trucks, ladders and power tools."
"""We have dummies you can resuscitate and we tied ropes to one and put it to a guy's bed."
...
"He walked into the room and they pulled the ropes and it stood up and he grabbed the ropes and was wrestling with it,"" Baecker remembered one prank, saying he laughed until he cried that day."
"He has cried other days, too, he said, when friends were injured or a child died - some of the hardest situations to handle."
"""There is a high level of danger for firefighters and that is not to be taken lightly,"" Drake said."
"""It is really not."
"And people trust us to be able to take care of those situations and to be able to do that."""

"Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to automative passive restraint systems."
"More particularly, the present invention concerns automotive passive restraint systems for convertible-type vehicles."
"Even more particularly, the present invention concerns a three-point passive restraint system for a convertible-type vehicle."
2.
"Prior Art
The advent of modern-day convertible-type vehicles has given rise to much improved technology over previous convertible-type vehicles."
"The popularity of the present-day convertible-type vehicles when coupled with governmental regulations has seen the advent of improved structural supports, safety systems, improved materials of construction and the like."
"Recently, governmental regulations have called for the imposition and the requirement of new passive restraint systems for utilization in such vehicles."
"In fact, it has now been mandated by governmental agencies that by 1990, convertible-type vehicles, as well as all other types of vehicles, have passive restraint systems."
"Presently, there are two recognized passive restraint systems, to wit, air bags and three-point safety or seat belt systems."
"Because of the cost associated with air bags, it is impractical to incorporate such into lower priced vehicles."
"Thus, there exists a need for a passive restraint system which meets the presently mandated governmental regulations and which can be economically installed in lower-priced convertible-type vehicles."
"As is known to those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains, present restraint systems which are associated with convertible-type vehicles ordinarily have the safety belt extending from the rear quarter panel pillar from which the belts then extend over the lap and shoulder of the occupant of the vehicle."
Such systems fail to meet governmental mandates.
"As will be subsequently detailed herein, there is provided an improved passive restraint system which will meet governmental regulations and which is economically incorporated into lower priced convertible-type vehicles."

"Field of the Invention
The field of invention relates to feeder apparatus, and more particularly pertains to a new and improved bird feeder apparatus wherein the same is arranged to permit selective elimination of various classes of birds from attaining access to food within the feeder organization."
2.
"Description of the Prior Art
Weight responsive feeder structure has been utilized in the prior art to minimize access to food within a feeder structure to relative large birds that typically monopolize food within a particular source, such as the bird feeder, and prevent smaller birds from obtaining nourishment."
The instant organization attempts to overcome deficiencies of the prior art by providing a simplified yet compact and effective organization that permits selective adjustment of the structure to eliminate various categories of birds depending upon geographical and seasonal requirements.
Examples of prior art structure include U.S. Pat.
No.
"4,649,865 to Riggi wherein a perch is mounted to an overhang roof structure, whereupon a bird or animal above a desired weight mounting the perch, the perch is pivotally directed downwardly to prevent access to the food within the organization."
U.S. Pat.
No.
"4,867,104 to Vandiver sets forth a bird feeder wherein rotary members are mounted about the base of the structure to rotate and prevent a squirrel and the like from obtaining a grip about the feeder structure and thereby discouraging such animals from access to the feeder."
U.S. Pat.
Reissue No.
"32,970 to Furlani sets forth a bird feeder apparatus wherein an outer sleeve mounted relative to an inner feeder is directed downwardly against bias of a coaxial spring to displace openings of the inner sleeve and central member to prevent access of the larger birds to food within the feeder."
U.S. Pat.
No.
"4,846,111 to Kilham sets forth a bendable coil wire perch that is deflected upon a larger bird mounting thereon to prevent a larger bird from obtaining a grip relative to the housing."
"As such, it may be appreciated that there continues to be a need for a new and improved bird feeder apparatus which addresses both the problems of ease of use as well as effectiveness in construction and in this respect, the present invention substantially fulfills this need."
"Q:

What are words which stand at the very end of a sentence (like ""yo"" and ""tomo"") called?"
"As far as I know, ""yo"" at the end of a sentence indicates that quite new information is contained in the sentence, ""tomo"" ascertains that the content expressed in the sentence is definitely true."
"Both are placed even behind the predicative of the sentence: sentence-yo, sentence-tomo."
Do you know other words that are used like them?
"A:

These are called ""sentence-final particles"", or [終助詞]{しゅう・じょ・し}."
There are many particles that can be used in this way; probably more than is acceptable for the scope of questions on this site.
"But some common ones are ね (""agreement""), か (question marker), わ (see this post), and な (prohibition)."

"In 1931, Dr. Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize Physiology or Medicine for his discovery that cancer cells have a fundamentally different energy metabolism compared to healthy cells."
Most experts consider him to be the greatest biochemist of the 20th century.
"His lab staff also included Hans Krebs, Ph.D., after whom the Krebs cycle was named."
The Krebs cycle refers to the oxidative reduction pathways that occur in the mitochondria.
So just how does the metabolic inflexibility of cancer cells differ from healthy cells?
"A cell can produce energy in two ways: aerobically, in the mitochondria, or anaerobically, in the cytoplasm, the latter of which generates lactic acid — a toxic byproduct."
"Warburg discovered that in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells overproduce lactic acid."
This is known as The Warburg Effect.
"Mitochondrial energy production is far more efficient, capable of generating 18 times more energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) than anaerobic energy generation."
"Warburg concluded that the prime cause of cancer was the reversion of energy production from aerobic energy generation to a more primitive form of energy production, anaerobic fermentation."
"To reverse cancer, he believed you had to disrupt the energy production cycle that is feeding the tumor, and that by reverting back to aerobic energy metabolism you could effectively ""starve"" it into remission."
"Although he was never able to conclusively prove it, he maintained this view until his death in 1970."
One of his goals in life was to discover the cure for cancer.
"Sadly, as so typically happens in science, his theories were never accepted by conventional science despite his academic pedigree — until now."
"The New York Times recently published a long, detailed article about the history of modern cancer research, including Warburg's theories on cancer, which are now becoming more widely accepted."
"President Trump condemned North Korea’s latest missile launch on Tuesday and questioned whether the reclusive regime’s leader has “anything better to do.”

“North Korea has just launched another missile."
"Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?,” the president wrote early Tuesday after North Korea fired a rocket that landed in the Sea of Japan."
Trump also suggested America’s allies in the region – Japan and South Korea – will put pressure on President Kim​ Jong Un’s regime to rein in its nuclear ambitions.
“​Hard to believe that South Korea​ and Japan will put up with this much longer.
"Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!​,” he wrote.​

The president, who has said he has lost patience with ​North Korea over its continuing military provocations, has asked South Korea, Japan and China to use any leverage they have on the Hermit Kingdom."
He talked to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the phone Sunday about the threat North Korea poses in the region.

Comedian Steve Harvey—whose dating self-help book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man inspired this ensemble rom-com—hangs over the action like a deity, appearing on TV screens as he dispenses advice on an Oprah-esque talk show."
Meanwhile a quartet of women follow his questionable advice in hopes of molding their boyfriends into ideal companions.
"Screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman interweave four asinine, underdeveloped plot lines, and Tim Story's prosaic direction reduces their script to a shambolic nightmare, more like an infomercial for Harvey's book than anything else."
"With Taraji P. Henson, Romany Malco, Gabrielle Union, and Kevin Hart, whose self-effacing humor does wonders to undercut the story's banality."

"Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has finally thrown in the towel to Russia…

Batka Bows for CashBy Tai AdelajaRussia Profile05/25/2011 Pressed up against a rock and the hardest of places, combative Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has finally thrown in the towel, agreeing last week to the sale of stakes in some of his country’s highly sought-after assets."
The first salvo in the long-awaited privatization program came with the announcement of a deal to sell a 50 percent stake in the Beltransgaz company to Russia for $2.5 billion.
"“The Russian side is ready to buy our stake in (pipeline operator) Beltransgaz for $2.5 billion,” Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich told state news agency Belta on Friday."
"Russia’s gas monopoly Gazprom already owns a 50 percent stake in Beltransgaz, which it acquired through a series of purchases between 2007 and 2010."
                                          No.

Did the District Court err in fixing the amount of Thaut’s restitution?
I.
"FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

¶5     On September 20, 1998, Robert Meyers (“Meyers”) was sitting in his car when Thaut

walked up and fired a shotgun through the window, striking Meyers in the face."
"Although

Meyers survived the blast, he suffered serious injury and his vehicle was damaged."
"¶6     On December 17, 1998, the Flathead County Attorney filed an Information charging

Thaut with attempted deliberate homicide."
"On April 10, 2000, the County Attorney filed a

plea agreement in which Thaut agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges of felony

aggravated assault and felony criminal mischief."
"On June 8, 2000, Thaut appeared before

the District Court and entered guilty pleas to these two charges."
¶7     Thaut’s probation officer prepared a presentence investigation and report (“PSI”).
"On

August 3, 2000, the District Court conducted a sentencing hearing."
"During the hearing,

Thaut pleaded with the court not to incarcerate him."
"Thaut argued that he had learned his

lesson, and given the opportunity, he would return to society, work hard and be a productive

                                             2
taxpayer."
"Thaut argued he had always been a hard worker, and that he had the ability to earn

a decent income, to pay restitution and to give back to the community through volunteer

work."
"¶8      In spite of Thaut’s pleas, the court sentenced him to 30 years at Montana State Prison

and ordered he would not be eligible for parole for 10 years."
"The District Court’s Order

imposed 10 conditions upon Thaut in the event he should be released on parole, including

a requirement that he pay the victim $440,107 in restitution, the amount previously awarded

Meyers in a civil judgment against Thaut."
"¶9      Thaut filed a notice of appeal on September 29, 2000."
"On November 1, 2000, he filed

a consolidated motion for re-sentencing and motion for stay of appeal, requesting a

redetermination of restitution under this Court’s decision in State v. Pritchett, 2000 MT 261,

302 Mont."
"1, 11 P.3d 539."
"On May 3, 2001, the District Court held a re-sentencing hearing."
"At the hearing, Thaut stated he could not pay restitution because he had no work skills, no

assets, he was in debt to his mother for $50,000, and he had no prospect of earning or

acquiring money in the future."
"Thaut also asserted he suffered from a mental illness which

prevented him from earning more than minimum wage."
"¶10     After the re-sentencing hearing, the District Court issued a supplemental order on

September 12, 2001, reducing Thaut’s restitution obligation to $69,457, plus $650 in

extradition costs and $1000 in public defender fees."
"In the order, the District Court found

Thaut had the ability to pay the ordered amount of restitution based on his previous

testimony that he has always had the ability to work hard and earn a decent living."
"Further,

in considering Thaut’s ability to pay, the court discounted his claim that he was indebted to

                                              3
his mother because Thaut failed to provide any proof of the $50,000 loan, and because he

had not made any attempt to pay his mother back."
"The District Court reasoned when Thaut

wanted to avoid incarceration he had grand employment opportunities; however, when he

was attempting to avoid paying restitution, he had no ability to earn an income."
"The District

Court further noted Thaut would have a period of 20 years to repay his victim after being

paroled, resulting in a payment of less than $4,000 a year, which it found was a reasonable

obligation to impose on him."
"¶11    On April 22, 2003, this Court issued an order which granted counsel’s motion to

withdraw and concluded Thaut had a legitimate issue on appeal as to whether the District

Court erred in determining his ability to pay restitution."
"This Court ordered new counsel be

appointed to handle Thaut’s appeal."
"In the mean time, House Bill 220 was enacted amending

the restitution statutes."
"House Bill 220 retroactively applied to offenders who had an unpaid

restitution obligation as of October 1, 2003, the effective date of the Act."
"This appeal

ensued."

"STANDARD OF REVIEW

¶12    Our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary."
"State v. Kennedy, 2004 MT

53, ¶ 13, 320 Mont."
"161, ¶ 13, 85 P.3d 1279, ¶ 13."
"When reviewing questions pertaining to

a criminal sentence for legality, this Court’s review is confined to whether the sentence is

within the parameters provided by the statute."
"Pritchett, ¶ 6."
"However, a district court’s

determination regarding a defendant’s future ability to pay restitution is essentially a finding

of fact that should be affirmed unless it is “clearly erroneous,” with appropriate deference

given to the court’s views on the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence."
"4
See, e.g., Moore v. State, 2002 MT 315, ¶ 13, 313 Mont."
"126, ¶ 13, 61 P.3d 746, ¶ 13."
III.
"DISCUSSION

                                         ISSUE ONE

¶13    Are the restitution statutes, as amended by the 2003 Legislature, House Bill 220,

unconstitutional?"
¶14    Thaut raises numerous reasons why this Court should find HB 220 is unconstitutional.
"These include: HB 220 is unconstitutional because it eliminated the requirement of

determining whether a person has the ability to pay restitution; HB 220 effectively created

a debtors’ prison by sentencing a person who cannot afford to pay restitution to a death

sentence of parole and probation; HB 220 is a denial of due process because it requires

offenders pay restitution based on the full replacement cost of property rather than fair

market value; under the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Williams v. Illinois (1970),

399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct."
"2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586, Montana is prohibited from enacting a law that

requires a person to remain on probation or parole until they have completed restitution

payments where the person does not have the ability to pay before their sentence ends; HB

220 is unconstitutional because it is an ex post facto law as it applies retroactively “to

offenders who have an unpaid restitution obligation on [October 1, 2003];” and finally, HB

220 is fatally flawed because it lacks a severability clause."
"Therefore, Thaut demands that

HB 220 be nullified in its entirety."
¶15    We conclude Thaut lacks proper standing to raise these constitutional issues.
"Therefore, we decline to fully address the issue of whether the restitution statutes, as

amended by the 2003 Legislature, are unconstitutional."
"5
¶16    We have stated the following criteria must be satisfied to establish standing:

       (1) The complaining party must clearly allege past, present or threatened
       injury to a property or civil right; and (2) the alleged injury must be
       distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, but the injury need not
       be exclusive to the complaining party."
"As to the injury requirement, we have stated that a plaintiff is required to
       allege “a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy."
.
.
".” “They must
       allege an injury personal to themselves as distinguished from one suffered by
       the community in general.” The requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate an
       injury “is most easily satisfied if a plaintiff alleges either a direct economic
       injury or alleges that she is confronted with the prospect of criminal
       prosecution.” [Citations omitted.]"
"Helena Parents Com'n v. Lewis and Clark County Com'rs (1996), 277 Mont."
"367, 371, 922

P.2d 1140, 1142-43."
"This Court has further held the defendant must show a direct, personal

injury resulting from application of the law in question in order to successfully challenge the

constitutionality of a criminal statute."
"State v. Krantz (1990), 241 Mont."
"501, 506, 788 P.2d

298, 301."
"¶17    Thaut has not suffered any past, present or threatened injury to either his property

interests or to his civil rights by the amended restitution statutes."
"Under the facts presented,

any alleged injury is hypothetical or speculative."
"In fact, many of the constitutional

violations Thaut alleges cannot directly affect him because restitution in his case was

determined under the previous version of the statutes."
"¶18    The record clearly indicates the District Court evaluated Thaut’s ability to pay in

establishing the amount of restitution under the statutes in effect at the time he was

sentenced."
"Further, unlike in State v. Farrell (1984), 207 Mont."
"483, 676 P.2d 168, and in

Pritchett, the District Court did not establish the length of sentence based on the amount of



                                               6
time required for Thaut to pay restitution."
"Rather, the District Court established the length

of sentence based on the plea agreement, and then determined $69,457 was a reasonable

amount for Thaut to pay given the length of time he would have to pay it."
"¶19    Additionally, only $2000 of the total restitution amount was awarded for damages to

Meyer’s property."
"The balance was awarded to cover medical expenses and a grant from the

Montana Board of Crime Control in favor of Meyers."
"Therefore, Thaut cannot seriously

claim he is in danger of being injured by the requirement of the amended statutes that full

replacement value be used in determining the amount of restitution for property damaged as

a result of criminal conduct."
"¶20    Thaut’s argument that he will remain indefinitely on probation or parole due to his

inability to pay restitution is speculative at best."
"The District Court determined, based on

Thaut’s representations and his past employment history, that he should be capable of paying

the full amount prior to the end of his sentence without any undue hardship."
"Even if it turns

out that such is not the case, the restitution statutes, as amended in 2003, allow the District

Court the discretion to require Thaut to perform community service in lieu of paying

restitution if it determines he is unable to pay."
"See § 46-18-241(3), MCA."
"¶21    Relying on this Court’s holding in Gryzcan (“the fear of prosecution is sufficient [to

establish standing], unless there are circumstances that make such fears ‘imaginary’ or

‘wholly speculative’”), the dissent opines at ¶ 44 Thaut has standing to challenge the

restitution statutes as amended in 2003 because “there is nothing ‘imaginary’ or ‘wholly

speculative’ about the effects of the amendments enacted by HB 220 on Thaut.”

¶22    Assuming the District Court did not err in setting the amount of restitution, and Thaut

                                              7
will continue to have the ability to make such payments, the only “effect” the amended

statutes can have on Thaut is he will now be required to make such payments through the

Department of Corrections, instead of through the Clerk of Court."
"The dissent is incorrect

in its supposition “if [Thaut] fails to meet the restitution obligations of his revised sentence,

any parole or probation which he is granted will likely be revoked.” ¶ 44."
"Both the parole

and probation revocation statutes still provide for consideration of an offender’s ability to

pay during any revocation proceeding."
"See § 46-23-1025(3), MCA; § 46-18-203(6), MCA."
"If at such time Thaut can demonstrate his “failure to pay restitution was not attributable to

a failure on his part to make a good faith effort to obtain sufficient means to make the

restitution payments,” his violation may be excused by the court, and the petition to revoke

must be dismissed."
"Section 46-18-203(6), MCA."
"¶23    We conclude Thaut lacks proper standing to raise the stated constitutional issues on

appeal because he has not shown a direct, personal injury resulting from application of the

restitution statutes, nor has he shown a threat of such injury."
"As our determination that Thaut

lacks standing is dispositive, we decline to address his constitutional challenges to the

amended statutes."
"ISSUE TWO

¶24    Did the District Court err in fixing the amount of Thaut’s restitution?"
"¶25    Thaut argues the District Court erred in determining his ability to pay restitution for

two reasons: first, the District Court failed to meet the statutory requirements of § 46-18-

242(1), MCA, in establishing the defendant’s financial resources and future ability to pay;

and second, the court violated his due process rights by sentencing him in a way that was

                                               8
fundamentally unfair by failing to consider several factors in determining his ability to pay

$69,457 in restitution."
"¶26    Thaut says the factors that the District Court failed to consider are: Thaut is currently

52 years old and by the time he can be paroled in 2008, he would have a short amount of

time to work in order to make his restitution payments; he will be unable to pay the

restitution as he already has a $427,000 civil judgment against him in favor of Meyers;

Thaut’s most recent past employment consisted of minimum wage jobs; Thaut had no assets

at the time of sentencing and has no ability to acquire assets in the future; finally, Thaut

suffers from mental health issues resulting from a 1973 car accident in which he allegedly

sustained a head injury."
"¶27    The record establishes the District Court’s decision was based upon substantial

evidence Thaut would have the ability to pay some restitution from his prison earnings and

more should he make parole."
"Thaut himself stated that he could pay, before he learned that

he would have to spend some time in prison, and the District Court did not abuse its

discretion in believing this version of his testimony."
"¶28    We conclude the District Court adequately complied with all of the statutory

requirements in determining the amount of restitution Thaut had the ability to pay."
"Under

§ 46-18-201(5), MCA (1997), sentencing courts were required to impose a sentence that

included payment of full restitution whenever the court found the victim of the offense

suffered a pecuniary loss."
"“However, this general mandate is subject to the detailed

procedures and qualifications found in §§ 46-18-241 to 249, MCA."
"District courts are not

authorized to impose a sentence of restitution until all these additional statutory requirements

                                               9
are satisfied.” Pritchett, ¶ 7."
"¶29    The District Court relied upon the information in both the PSI and the Supplemental

PSI, in addition to the testimony presented at both of the sentencing hearings, in determining

the proper amount of restitution, and Thaut’s ability to pay during his 30 year sentence."
"Section 46-18-242, MCA (1997), provided:

       (1) Whenever the court believes that a victim of the offense may have
       sustained a pecuniary loss as a result of the offense ."
.
.
"the court shall order
       the probation officer ."
.
.
"to include in the presentence investigation and report:
              (a) documentation of the offender’s financial resources and future
              ability to pay restitution; and
              (b) documentation of the victim’s pecuniary loss ."
.
.
.
"Section 46-18-242(1)(a)-(b), MCA (1997)."
"¶30    In Pritchett, ¶ 5, this Court held the District Court had no authority to impose a

sentence of restitution absent the documentation required under § 46-18-242(1), MCA."
"In

State v. Brown (1994), 263 Mont."
"223, 226, 867 P.2d 1100, 1100-01, superseded on other

grounds by § 46-18-241, MCA, this Court held documentation of the defendant’s financial

resources was insufficient to support the court’s restitution order where the PSI listed

defendant’s current assets, but failed to assign a monetary value to assets other than the

defendant’s retirement account, and the PSI provided no documentation regarding the

defendant’s future ability to pay restitution after his release from prison."
"However, in

Thaut’s case the PSI and Supplemental PSI provided adequate documentation both as to

Thaut’s assets and his ability to pay restitution in the future."
"The Supplemental PSI

prepared of May 1, 2001, incorporated the extensive employment history contained in the

original PSI dated August 1, 2000."
"The employment history contained Thaut’s own



                                               10
statements that he only had a high school education, but he was a “hard worker” and was

“willing to do the tough jobs” to earn a living."
"Thaut recounted his past employment as an

outside worker with Wal-Mart, his work as a lot attendant for a Bozeman car dealer, and his

ability to earn extra money as a participant in medical research."
"¶31     In addition to his employment information, the Supplemental PSI advised the District

Court that while Thaut believed he was in poor health due to a head injury he allegedly

received in a 1973 car accident, he had no “documented” physical limitations or disabilities,

and he was currently unemployed only due to his incarceration."
"It also noted that he said he

had no assets, and allegedly was $50,000 in debt."
"¶32     The Supplemental PSI included a sentencing recommendation from the Probation

Officer who prepared the report."
"Among other things, he recommended Thaut be required

to pay restitution in the amount of $427,000 in accordance with the civil judgment ordered

against him."
"¶33     Also, at the time of making its determination, the District Court had at its disposal a

copy of the Department of Health and Human Services psychiatric evaluation prepared at the

request of Thaut’s counsel, which refuted Thaut’s claims that he suffered from a mental

disease or defect, or that he suffered brain damage as a result of a 1973 car accident."
"The

report concluded, Thaut is an “angry, manipulative man,” who appeared to be “malingering

symptoms of mental illness” to prove himself unfit to proceed with his legal defense in this

case."
"¶34     After considering the substantial information presented, the District Court concluded

that Thaut was able to pay restitution based on his abilities, that he was not unable to hold

                                              11
a job because of a mental disability, and that he did not have to pay his mother $50,000."
"¶35    We conclude that the PSI and the Supplemental PSI contained sufficient information

to satisfy the requirements of § 46-18-242, MCA (1997)."
"We also conclude the District

Court had sufficient information on which to base its ultimate conclusion Thaut was able to

pay restitution."
"¶36     We next turn to the question of whether the amount of restitution was appropriately

determined by the District Court."
"Section 46-18-244(2), MCA (1997), provides:

       In determining the amount, method, and time of each payment, the court shall
       consider the financial resources and future ability of the offender to pay."
"The
       court shall provide for payment to a victim of the full amount of the pecuniary
       loss caused by the offense."
"The offender may assert any defense that the
       offender could raise in a civil action for the loss sought to be compensated by
       the restitution order."
"¶37    It is clear from a review of the record the District Court had not only testimony but

an abundance of documentation, not objected to by Thaut, from which it could determine the

proper amount of restitution owed."
"In its Supplemental Order dated September 12, 2001, the

District Court stated:

       In imposing this Order, the [c]ourt has accepted without objection that the
       victim has suffered special damages in the amount of $57,000.00; in the form
       of medical expenses, $55,000.00; in property damage of $2,000.00."
"In
       addition, the Montana Board of Crime Control has awarded a grant of
       $12,457.00 which is how the total of $69,457.00 was arrived at."
"The [c]ourt concludes that the Defendant would have the ability to pay this
       amount over the course of his sentence, and the [c]ourt specifically finds that
       the Defendant was not credible in his testimony regarding his inability to pay
       back the restitution."
"The result of the District Court’s order is that, after considering the information presented,

it determined Thaut had the ability to pay restitution and he must pay only medical expenses,

                                             12
the grant from the Board of Crime Control and property damage."
"This decision is amply

supported by the record."
"¶38    Should Thaut, without fault on his part, find he is unable to meet his obligation to pay

both restitution and the civil judgment, he could petition the District Court for relief."
"If at

such time the District Court determines he is indeed unable to pay, it may order him to

perform community service for which he will receive a credit against restitution."
"Section 46-

18-241(3), MCA."
Thaut has not been treated unfairly.
"¶39    Therefore, we hold the District Court did not err when it ordered Thaut to pay

restitution in the amount of $69,457."
IV.
"CONCLUSION

¶40    We affirm the order of the District Court requiring Thaut to pay restitution in the

amount of $69,457."

Justice James C. Nelson dissents and concurs."
¶41    I concur with the Court’s Opinion as to Issue 2.
"I dissent from our Opinion as to

Issue 1."
"¶42    I cannot agree that Thaut does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of

the amendments enacted by the Legislature under HB 220."
"The amendments referred to in

our Opinion were specifically made retroactive by the Legislature “to offenders who have

an unpaid restitution obligation on [the effective date of this act]”--the effective date being

October 1, 2003."
"Accordingly, the effect of these amendments is not speculative as the Court

opines."
"Rather, Thaut has and is suffering a present or threatened injury to both his property

interests and to his civil rights."
"He is now and will be for years in the future burdened with

a restitution obligation that may or may not be lawful, depending upon whether the

amendments under HB 220 are constitutional."
"¶43    I conclude that Thaut meets all of the tests articulated by the Court in ¶ 15, under

Helena Parents v. Lewis & Clark Cty (1996), 277 Mont."
"367, 371, 922 P.2d 1140, 1142-43."
"Moreover, in Gryczan v. State (1997), 283 Mont."
"433, 442-46, 942 P.2d 112, 118-19, we

applied the Helena Parents test."
"Importantly, we also held that a person need not suffer the

actual consequences of the enforcement of a criminal statute--in Gryczan, arrest and

prosecution--in order to challenge the statute’s constitutionality."
"The fear of prosecution is

sufficient, unless there are circumstances that make such fears “imaginary” or “wholly

speculative.” Gryczan, 283 Mont."
"at 444-45, 942 P.2d at 119 (citing, among other cases,

Babbitt v. United Farm Workers (1979), 442 U.S. 289, 302, 99 S.Ct."
"2301, 2310-11, 60

L.Ed.2d 895)."
"14
¶44    In the case at bar, there is nothing imaginary or wholly speculative about the effects

of the amendments enacted by HB 220 on Thaut."
"He is presently and will be for years

burdened with a restitution obligation that may or may not be lawful depending on whether

the HB 220 amendments are constitutional."
"If he fails to meet the restitution obligations of

his revised sentence, any parole or probation which he is granted will very likely be revoked."
This is not an imaginary or wholly speculative consequence; it is a reality.
"And Thaut’s

concerns about the threat of that consequence entitle him to challenge the constitutionality

of the statutes that may result in that action being taken."
"Thaut’s concerns are no more

imaginary or wholly speculative than were the plaintiffs’ fears of arrest and prosecution in

Gryczan."
"¶45    The Court tries to avoid the standing rules set out in Gryczan by claiming that Thaut

can challenge his restitution obligations at some point in the future under §§ 46-23-1025(3),

MCA, and 46-18-203(6), MCA."
"While Thaut does have that right, his standing to also

challenge the statutes now is not affected."
"Indeed, we rejected the Court’s position in

Gryczan where we clearly adopted the rule that the individual has present standing to

challenge a statute where the individual is within the class of persons whom the statute is

designed to impact, Lee v. State (1981), 195 Mont."
"1, 635 P.2d 1282, cert."
"denied, 456 U.S.

1006, 102 S.Ct."
"2295, 73 L.Ed.2d 1300 (1982); where the individual is directly affected by

the statute, Epperson v. Arkansas (1968), 393 U.S. 97, 89 S.Ct."
"266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228; where

the individual is one of the persons against whom the statute was enacted to operate, Doe v.

Bolton (1973), 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct."
"739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201; and where the statute imposes

criminal penalties, even if those had never been and might never be applied, Babbitt, 442

2301.
"Moreover, the Court continues to ignore the fact that Thaut is

presently charged with a restitution obligation that may or may not be constitutional."
"¶46    Under the authorities cited by the Court and above, I conclude that Thaut has standing

to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the HB 220 amendments and, accordingly, I

would address that issue."
I dissent from our failure to do so.

"Did the [suppression] court err in suppressing

States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 821-822 (1982)."

""God demands segregation,"" says New Orleans' Mrs. B. J. Gaillot Jr., president of segregationist Save Our Nation Inc. She is a Roman Catholic, and when Archbishop Joseph Francis Rummel, 85 [1876-1964], ordered full desegregation of New Orleans parochial schools for next fall, Mrs. Gaillot responded with picketing and loud protest."
She was not alone.
"Leander Perez, influential political boss of Plaquemines Parish and also a Catholic, suggested reprisals against the clergy: ""Cut off their water."
"Quit giving them money to feed their fat bellies."""
"And State Representative Rodney Buras of New Orleans proclaimed that he would fight Arch, bishop Rummel's demand for desegregation ""even to the extreme of being excommunicated."""
"Last week the archbishop answered some of his loudest parishioners with firm letters of ""paternal admonition."""
"The letter to Mrs. Gaillot, mother of two children in Catholic schools, was a ""fatherly warning'' of automatic excommunication if she continued promoting ""flagrant disobedience to the decision to open our schools to ALL."""
"Said she nervously: ""If they can show me from the Bible where I am wrong, I will get down on my knees before Archbishop Rummel and beg his forgiveness."""
"Postponing that experience, the archbishop spent two hours conferring with State Lawmaker Buras, recipient of another Rummel letter, who emerged saying that he still opposed all integration."
"""However,"" he added, ""as a member of the Roman Catholic Church, I must abide by its laws and decisions."""
Parochial schools enroll half the white pupils in New Orleans.
"After Rummel's order, segregationist Catholics considered transferring their children to public schools."
"But in a landmark decision last week, New Orleans' Federal District Judge J. Skelly Wright took a severe look at New Orleans' public schools, which still have admitted only twelve Negroes to six previously all-white schools."
"Judge Wright agreed with 102 Negro petitioners that the city school board is hardly desegregating ""with all deliberate speed."""
"Wright forbade the board from further use of the Louisiana pupil-placement law, and ordered desegregation of the first six grades in all New Orleans public schools next fall."
As a result.
New Orleans faces the biggest wholesale school integration yet attempted in any major Southern city.
"In the wake of the United States Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling, Joseph Francis Rummel, Archbishop of New Orleans, began planning the integration of the archdiocese's schools."
"It would take eight years, several court battles and the excommunication of three prominent Catholic political figures for Rummel to achieve his goal."
"As Americans debate the public and private responsibilities of Catholic politicians in this election year, the story of Archbishop Rummel's decision to use the serious punishment of excommunication with members of his flock is returning to the national conscience."
"This time, the story is being wielded by conservative Catholic groups that would like to portray Burke's stance on politicians, Communion and abortion as the moral equivalent of Rummel's stand against racism."
Rummel was concerned about racial integration even beforeBrown v. Board of Education was handed down.
"In 1953, a year before Brown, he wrote a pastoral letter called ""Blessed Are the Peacemakers"" that ended segregation in archdiocesan parishes."
"In another pastoral letter in February of 1956, he wrote that ""compulsory racial segregation is morally wrong and sinful,"" according to Dr. Charles E. Nolan, the archdiocese archivist."
"The following month, lawyer and segregationist Emile Wagner founded the Association of Catholic Laymen in response to Rummel's statements about integrating New Orleans schools."
"Wagner called integration ""an unproven principle and the plot of communists,"" according to New Orleans archdiocese archives."
"Rummel responded by calling the group ""unnecessary"" and ""scandalous"" and in an April letter to the group's 30 board members, threatened each with excommunication."
"In May, Wagner and his group backed down and disbanded, but later sent a letter to Pope Pius XII, appealing their ability to organize without threat of excommunication."
"As the 1950s wore on, and much of the South ignored Brown, Rummel gradually began planning the integration of New Orleans Catholic schools."
"""Archbishop Rummel knew what he was up against in New Orleans politics, and he knew he had to lay the groundwork slowly,"" said the Rev."
"William F. Maestri, a spokesman for the archdiocese."
"In 1960, legislators in Baton Rouge sent letters to the archbishop threatening the withdrawal of aid to, and tax-exempt status of, New Orleans Catholic schools should Rummel persist in his attempts to integrate them."
"In March of 1962, Rummel announced a plan to integrate all Catholic schools in New Orleans the following school year, but he again met with strong resistance from segregationist Catholics."
"Judge Leander Perez, president of the Plaquemines parish, was one such Catholic."
(Louisiana is divided into parishes rather than counties.)
"""Perez was like the Richard Daley of Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes,"" said Maestri."
"""He was an old-style political boss."""
"At a public rally the day after Rummel's announcement, Perez told an audience that no matter what the archbishop said, Catholic schools in Plaquemines would not integrate."
"He urged them to pull their children from parochial schools, and withhold contributions to the archdiocese."
"After several more public, heated exchanges with Perez, Rummel again sent letters to dissenting Catholic segregationists, in which he said they ""promoted flagrant disobedience,"" and that unless they backed down, they would be excommunicated."
"Many again relented, but Perez and two others did not."
"Rummel waited two weeks, and when he didn't hear from the final three, he publicly excommunicated them for their ""flagrant disregard"" for his ""fatherly council."""
"Maestri said Rummel's actions were not political, but moral."
"""For him this was a fundamental moral issue,"" he said."
"""He was clearly motivated by one thing: to do what was just and right."""

A lucky dog rescued from freaque wave

A JACK russell terrier swept into the ocean at Currumbin by a freak wave on Friday was fighting for her life after a dramatic rescue in which a man performed CPR on the stricken animal."
Tugun resident Hilary Smith was walking her 11-year-old pet Betty Boo off the leash on the beach about 1.45pm on Friday when the wave struck.
"""I wasn't near the sea ... there was a freak wave, then it was right up to my chest,"" she said."
"""(Betty Boo) flipped backwards and disappeared out to sea."""
She had to feel her way through thick foam for five minutes to locate her white dog which was not breathing when she found it.
She rushed to shore where Currumbin Surf Club director and off-duty surf lifesaver Dave Smith ran to meet her.
He took the dog from her and performed CPR on Betty Boo.
After 10 minutes the dog started to breathe and was taken to a nearby veterinary clinic.
Ms Smith said Betty Boo was fighting for her life.
"""The only thing she has going for her is she's a fighter,"" she said."
"""Don't go on to the beach."
"I didn't show respect for the sea."""
"We all know whipped cream, but I never realized the nearshore sea can be whipped up into cream also."
May be only in the Gold Coast.
What had happened in this story?
"Well, ""I wasn't near the sea ... there was a freak wave, then it was right up to my chest"" certainly leaves no room for skeptcism."
"That's a freaque wave all right, regardless what really happened there."
Only that no scientist can define or explain it otherwise to any degrees of satisfaction.
It just happened.
I can't quite visualize how to perform CPR on a dog.
But that was a lucky dog to be rescued.
"Yes, Ms Smith has the right mind-set: ""Show respect for the sea!"""
"Q:

What are the security risks of storing user roles/types in a cookie?"
Recently I had to use a website which stored things like user role (user or admin) in a cookie.
When I modified the username the displayed username changed in the website.
I immediately asked the developers of said website if it's secure to store the user role in a cookie if you can just modify it.
They told me that you could only break the UI of said website and that the back-end always checks the session cookie for important actions.
So let's say I want to build my own website and store things like user-type: admin or user in a cookie.
Is it safe to store the user type in a cookie if it's only used for UI purposes and not back-end purposes?
"A:

""Safe"" is always a relative term."
"If the data in the cookie is not used for authentication or authorisation, and it is just a configuration item that is exposed and could be used by anyone without a risk of misuse/abuse, then why not?"
The letters a d m i n are not special in and of themselves.
"At that point, it's just a UI toggle switch, just like dark/light mode."
The real question is about knowing the potential impacts of such a change.
The risks are about some future developer of the site misusing the cookie for sensitive things without understanding the consequence.

History Of Hickory, Polk, Cedar, Dade And Barton Counties,
Missouri, 1889."
Published by Goodspeed.
"Pages 867, 868
E. S. Casner, a breeder of fine horses in Barton County, Mo., was born
in Juniata County, Penn., September 17, 1846, and is a son of Thomas B.
and Sarah (Stees) Casner, who were also Pennsylvanians, their parents
coming from Germany."
"In 1847 they moved to Ohio, and ten years later
to Indiana, where the father died in 1872, and the mother still lives."
"They were members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and he was a
Republican in his political views, and during the late war served two
years in the Sixty-fourth Indiana Volunteer infantry, United States Army."
He was a mechanic by trade.
"E. S. Casner is one of three surviving
members of a family of five children, and in his youth received a common
school education."
"At the age of seventeen years he began clerking in a
store, which occupation he followed five years, and in 1870 he came to
Jasper County, Mo., and after farming three years, turned his attention
to mercantile pursuits, continuing until 1880, when he began lead mining."
"In 1887 he moved to Lamar, and soon after opened a stable of fine
breeding horses, owning three imported Percheron horses and a standard
bred Hambletonian horse, all of them fine animals."
"In connection with
managing his stable, he is engaged in mining, and all his property has
been acquired by hard work and good management, and has been made since
coming to Missouri, as he then had nothing."
"His first money was made
by breaking prairie at $2.50 per acre."
"He is a Republican in his
political views, and while in Jasper County held the office of
councilman one term."
"January 1, 1873, he was married to Miss Nellie
Gray, a native of New York, by whom he has three sons and one daughter."

"5 ways men can address—and help prevent—sexual harassment at work

A group of my best friends from high school were texting about the allegations against Harvey Weinstein when one of the men on the thread, who works in healthcare, raised an issue he recently encountered when discussing sexual harassment at work."
"""The most awkward conversation to have in a workplace environment is about sexual harassment,"" he texted."
"""It was me and four female colleagues and I stood no chance from the beginning."""
"Despite wanting to participate in the conversation, he admitted to feeling unsure of how to ask questions or demonstrate his support for the women in the group without making a misstep or potentially causing offense."
"Getty Images

Harvey Weinstein

But the need for men to speak up and out about incidents of sexual harassment at work has become increasingly clear."
"Data shows that roughly 71 percent of women do not report sexual harassment out of fear of retaliation, and far fewer bystanders report harassment they've witnessed."
"In a recent New York Times story about Weinstein, director Quentin Tarantino admitted to wishing he had followed the ""see something, say something"" model when it came to the producer's behavior."
"""I knew enough to do more than I did,"" he said."
"""There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip."
It wasn't secondhand.
"I knew he did a couple of these things."""
"While harassment can be experienced by anyone, data shows that 25 percent of women report being sexually harassed in the workplace — more than double the percentage of men."
"Here are five ways to be more proactive in preventing future misconduct and supporting colleagues who may be experiencing harassment:

1."
"Be an ""upstander,"" not a bystander

It's easy to turn a blind eye to an incident when you feel you aren't directly involved."
But failing to address inappropriate behavior that you've witnessed can still cause harm.
"""If you see a colleague being sexually harassed, or hear comments about women that are demeaning or derogatory, say something in that moment,"" Noreen A. Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, tells CNBC Make It."
"Rather than hesitating, Farrell, whose organization advocates for the civil rights of women and girls, says a simple comment like, ""That is making me uncomfortable,"" can show the harasser and the person being harassed that you're aware of what just happened."
"""Being an 'upstander' rather than just a bystander has a positive ripple effect for the entire workplace,"" she adds."
2.
"Correct harassers, even when a female colleague isn't present

Being an ally for women experiencing sexual harassment goes beyond just speaking up in their presence."
"""If there are guys gathered around a water cooler talking about a female colleague inappropriately, call them out right there so that it doesn't perpetuate,"" says Churches."
"In a Harvard Business Review article about male silence on sexual harassment issues, United States Naval Academy professor W. Brad Johnson and United States Naval War College professor David G. Smith explain the difference between men who model passive gender inclusion and those who model active gender inclusion."
"The former includes attending gender diversity workshops and monitoring your own individual behavior, while the latter includes vocally demanding respect and equality for women even when no one is watching."
"""A man's legitimacy as an ally to women is only fully expressed when he is an intentional exemplar and fierce watchdog for the behavior of other men,"" write Johnson and Smith."
"""It's very difficult for complaints to remain confidential."
"So any male ally should be confident that the colleague he is looking to stand up with is OK with how he is reporting it,"" adds Thomas, whose book ""Because of Sex"" explores women and workplace discrimination."
"After reaching out to the harassed employee, the next step would be to report the incident to a manager or HR lead so they are made aware of the behavior."
"""It helps an employee to know they have a group of people supporting them, and it leads to them not being quiet,"" says Churches."
4.
"Talk to the women in your life

""One of the many positive outcomes of the #MeToo campaign over the last week,"" says Thomas, ""is men of all ages realizing the ubiquity of this issue and going the next step further by asking the women in their lives, 'Has this happened to you, what happened?'"
"and respecting when women don't want to talk about what happened."""
"Even if the conversation doesn't yield as much insight as you had hoped, Farrell says being open to the discussion shows your colleague that you're an ally she can count on in the future."
"""Unpacking sexual harassment is not rocket science,"" adds Farrell."
"""You will be surprised by how much you can learn by asking a colleague a few questions over coffee about what makes her uncomfortable and/or what she has or others have experienced."""
"However, when discussing sexual harassment with a colleague, be mindful that the topic can be twice as uncomfortable — or painful — to talk about for someone who has experienced it."
By no means is that colleague obligated to educate you by telling their story.
"""We hear a lot about the idea of 'checking your privilege,' but that's what it really means,"" says Thomas."
"""Examine your own life and the ways in which you have or haven't escaped these situations unscathed."
"Look at your own history with how you come at these issues and educate yourself accordingly."""
5.
"Ask your employer for training

If you work for a company where the consequences of sexual harassment are not clearly outlined in an employee handbook or there is no formal training on how to spot and address the issue, Churches advises employees to not be afraid to ask for training."
"""Training for staff can identify where we may all have unconscious bias towards men and women, and help create an environment where everyone is welcome in the workplace,"" she adds."

“Life of Pi” — Yann Martel’s spectacular novel about survival after a shipwreck becomes a compelling drama, thanks to CGI."
"Luckily, we have CGI and a director like Ang Lee, who isn’t afraid of the technology that couldn’t save his version of “The Hulk.” Here, he uses the technology to tell the highly visual tale of a young man stranded on a pair of life rafts alongside circus animals."
"The tiger proves quite ferocious, but the pair have to work together if they will ever make it out."
Great photography and very little dialogue combine for a cinematic experience that loses a little something on your TV screen.
“Hitchcock” — The idea of a film about the making of “Psycho” is very appealing.
The casting of Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren as Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock makes this a sure thing.
"Unfortunately, these elements do not combine to hatch a watchable flick."
“Hercules/Xena Season 4” — This is a mixed bag.
"Xena loses some of its fun quotient in this season, as a morose Xena tries to save her companion Gabrielle."
The result is a little too much melodrama and not as much action.
"Hercules cruises into season 4 with a greater accent on the fighting and some clever story telling that includes two spoofs of films, “Some Like it Hot” and “Dirty Dancing.” There are also some high-spirited episodes directed by Bruce Campbell, who also returns as Autolycus, the Prince of Thieves."
“Ripper Street” — BBC cop dramas are a huge hit on cable and this series represents the best that the genre can aspire to be.
The story focuses on the crime team that failed to catch Jack the Ripper and they are left with keeping the peace while restoring faith in their precinct in the department.
Dark and historically accurate.
"Give Chickpeas A Chance: Why Hummus Unites, And Divides, The Mideast

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ramzi Haidar/AFP/Getty Images Ramzi Haidar/AFP/Getty Images

They call it ""The Hummus Wars."""
"Lebanon accused the Israeli people of trying to steal hummus and make it their national dish, explains Ronit Vered, a food journalist with the newspaper Haaretz in Tel Aviv."
"And so hummus became a symbol, she tells us, ""a symbol of all the tension in the Middle East."""
Hidden Kitchens: War & Peace & Food This is the first in a series of stories from The Kitchen Sisters about the role food plays in resolving or creating conflict around the world.
Explore their previous tales of Hidden Kitchens.
"The war began over a 4,532-pound plate of hummus."
"In 2009, Fadi Abboud — the minister of tourism ­­-- led Lebanon to break the world record for making the largest tub of hummus in the world."
"At the time, Abboud was also chairman of the Lebanese Industrialists Association."
"""A group of us just came from a food exhibition in France."
"There they were telling us that hummus is an Israeli traditional dish,"" he says."
"""I mean, the world now thinks that Israel invented hummus."""
Abboud could not let that stand.
"""I thought the best way to tell the world that the hummus is Lebanese is to break the Guinness Book of Records."""
"At the ceremony, when Guinness awarded Lebanon the prize for its epic plate of hummus, Abboud announced, ""We want the whole world to know that hummus and tabouli are Lebanese, and by breaking [into] the Guinness Book of World Records, the world should know our cuisine, our culture."""
The event was big news all over the Mideast region.
"""It was [a] big issue ­­that hummus was Lebanese,"" says Jawdat Ibrahim, an Arab-Israeli entrepreneur and owner of the popular Abu Gosh restaurant in an Arab village of the same name near Jerusalem."
"""I said, 'No, hummus is for everybody.'"
"""

And so, ""I hold a meeting in the village and I say, 'We are going to break Guinness Book of World Record.'"
"Not the Israeli government, the people of Abu Gosh."""
"When they did just that, in January 2010, the news was broadcast around the world."
"""In the town of Abu Gosh this morning, Israel re­took the title for the world's largest hummus dish, weighing 4 tons and served in a satellite dish,"" one news announcer intoned."
"""Yes,"" Ibrahim recalls, ""a satellite dish."
"It's a dish, no?"""
"Enlarge this image toggle caption Alessio Romenzi/AFP/Getty Images Alessio Romenzi/AFP/Getty Images

It drew more cameras than when Obama visited the country, Ibrahim says."
"Within hours, the Lebanese planned a counterattack --­­ and within months, they presented the world with a vat filled with 23,042 pounds of hummus."
"At the time, Abboud says, Lebanon was also trying to register the word ""hummus"" with the European Union, with a protective designation of origin — in the same way Champagne is registered by France, Parmigiano Reggiano by the Italians, and the Greeks lay claim to feta cheese."
Abboud was asking the EU to ban any country other than Lebanon from calling their product hummus.
"The Lebanese Industrialists Association called its campaign ""Hands Off Our Dishes."""
"""The word for chickpea in Arabic is hummus,"" says Abboud, who has been studying the history of hummus for some time now."
"""So the actual name comes from the Arabic for chickpea."""
"But in the end, the EU did not allow Lebanon to register hummus as its own, because it is the food of an entire region."
"'The Hummus Is Our Tradition'

That region includes Israel."
"Vered, the food journalist with Haaretz, has been chronicling the arc of Israeli food and cooking for years."
"Since the country is only 68 years old, and its citizens came from all over the world,­­ it lacked a unifying food tradition."
So hummus became a common ground for Israelis.
"""Palestinians also made hummus a symbol,"" Vered notes — a symbol ""that we didn't only take their land, we took their food as well and made it ours."""
Palestinian Nuha Musleh agrees.
"""The hummus is our tradition."
"Tabouli is our tradition,"" says Musleh, who works as a fixer with international journalists and owns a rug and antiques store in Ramallah."
We travel with Musleh from Jerusalem to the West Bank and Ramallah.
"After a long wait at a checkpoint while making the crossing, Musleh stops her SUV at one of her favorite restaurants in Ramallah so we can taste Palestinian hummus."
"""People run to get hummus when they are in Ramallah,"" she says."
"""It's like getting a good pizza in downtown Rome."
"Or getting a good T-bone steak in Texas, I imagine — I haven't been."""
"The restaurant owner, Ali Abu Anas, leads us into his kitchen, where plates of hummus piled with radishes, pickles and sumac are being made."
"""What distinguishes any hummus from another is nafs — which is 'soul' in Arabic,"" he says."
"Here, they pound the hummus by hand."
"Enlarge this image toggle caption Davia Nelson for NPR Davia Nelson for NPR

""They pound it, they pound it, they pound it."
"They don't use a machine,"" he says, as Musleh translates for us."
"""They use good tahini, sesame seeds crushed, sumac, lemons from Jericho, olive oil from the Hebron hills."""
"He tells us that Palestinians don't mind that Lebanon is proud of its hummus, or that Egypt makes hummus as well."
This is a dish that brings Arabs together.
But this same dish that unites Arabs doesn't always have the same effect between Palestinians and Israel.
"""In the first two decades of the state, the Israeli people didn't really eat local food."
"They stuck to their old habits,"" Vered explains."
"""It's also a political issue."
"If I eat Palestinian food, in a way, I acknowledge that they exist, that there are other people here who have food of their own."""
"By the late 1950s, the Israeli army started serving hummus in mess halls, and soon the average Israeli came to know hummus as an everyday food."
"As the local fare became more familiar to the Israeli immigrants from Europe, hummus became hip, something young people began to eat, says Dafna Hirsch, a sociologist at the Open University of Israel in Tel Aviv and author of the article ""Hummus is best when it is fresh and made by Arabs."""
"""Hummus became appropriated as the food of the new sabra,"" she says, using the term for an Israeli Jew born in Israeli territory, someone rooted in the land."
"""In Israel, hummus is considered a masculine dish,"" says Hirsch."
"""It's a kind of masculine ritual to go with a group of men to the hummusiya and eat hummus, wiping with these large circular gestures."""
"These days hummus isn't merely a dish ­­-- it's a subculture, says Shooky Galili, a young Tel Aviv entrepreneur who runs hummus101.com."
"The blog features recipes, reviews and recommendations for hummusiya, or hummus joints."
"There's a community around hummus, he says."
But Musleh --­­ the Palestinian woman who has been showing us around Ramallah — is far from taken with the subculture that Galili and many Israelis are feeding.
"""Hummus, unfortunately, has become in the category of fast foods,"" Musleh says."
"""But actually in [the Arab world] and all of Palestine, hummus is a Friday honorable breakfast."
"The father wakes up in the morning, makes hummus, makes food, invites all his daughters and daughters-­in-­law and sons."

"'Food Is Maybe The Only Thing That Gets People To Sit Together'

As Musleh drives us back to Jerusalem, back toward the checkpoint, she explains, ""there's usually congestion, because there's the refugee camp on left, a village called Qalandia on the right, and there's no man's land, Kufr Aqab."
"You have 130,000 people using one road."""
"As we get closer, we notice the rug merchants and food vendors who have set up makeshift businesses along the crawling route."
"""I never think of eating breakfast on days when I have to go through the checkpoint,"" Musleh says, ""because, look, there's a kebab stand and there's vendors selling ka'ak,­­ the bread with sesame and za'atar."""
These vendors do a big business.
"""Because you're stressed, you need something."
You could get shot.
The checkpoint could close.
You could get a gas bomb.
Suddenly you're not a human being.
"The kitchen of the checkpoint is really crucial to connect people together as human beings,"" Musah says."
"Back in a cab in Tel Aviv, we notice the tattoo on our taxi driver, David Varon, ­­and ask, ""What does it say?"""
""" 'No fear,' "" he says."
"""Some people are afraid to live in a country where there is so much blood and wars and conflict over thousands of years."
"You cannot live in fear in Israel."""
"Because, he adds, ""this conflict is about religion, and it will not be over until religion is over."""
"He drives, and continues, ""Hummus and falafel — food ­­is maybe the only thing that gets people to sit together."""
"Most of the hummus makers at the hummusiyat we visited in Israel ­­-- Lena's in Jerusalem, Abu Hassam in Tel Aviv, Hummus Said in Akko --­­ echoed Varon's thoughts."
But Dafna Hirsh from the Open University of Israel isn't buying it.
"""This kind of approach says, 'Oh, if we eat together, peace will come through the stomach.'"
But no.
"As long as colonization continues, as long as occupation continues, then hummus is not going to solve it."""
Many of the Palestinian hummus makers we spoke with expressed similar sentiments.
"Still, Jawdat Ibrahim has a vision ­­-- a kitchen vision."
"Ibrahim grew up in poverty in Abu Gosh, an Arab living in an Arab village in Israel."
"He came to America in his early 20s with just a quarter in his pocket, then won a $23 million lottery in 1973 in Chicago and returned to his village in Israel to open his hummus restaurant."
"""We broke the Guinness world record, but to make hummus is not the issue."
"To put people together, that is the main thing."
"People talk about blood and killing, and I want to take it to a different way,"" he says."
"""People can talk about the Middle East about nice things, not killing and shooting."""
The Hummus Wars continue.
"But, Ibrahim says, ""Nobody gets hurt with this war."""
"Recipe: Basic Hummus

Jerusalem A Cookbook by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi Hardcover, 288 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming."
How?
"This recipe comes courtesy of British-Israeli chef and restaurateur Yotam Ottolenghi, who grew up in Jewish West Jerusalem, and his business partner and co-chef Sami Tamimi, who grew up in the Muslim neighborhoods of East Jerusalem."
It is excerpted from Jerusalem: A Cookbook.
"This hummus is smooth and rich in tahini (sesame paste), just the way we like it."
"Makes 6 servings



1 1/4 cups dried chickpeas

1 teaspoon baking soda

6 1/2 cups water

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons light tahini paste

4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

4 cloves garlic, crushed

6 1/2 tablespoons ice cold water

Salt

The night before, put the chickpeas in a large bowl and cover them with cold water at least twice their volume."
Leave to soak overnight.
"The next day, drain the chickpeas."
Place a medium saucepan over high heat and add the drained chickpeas and baking soda.
"Cook for about three minutes, stirring constantly."
Add the water and bring to a boil.
"Cook, skimming off any foam and any skins that float to the surface."
"The chickpeas will need to cook for 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness, sometimes even longer."
"Once done, they should be very tender, breaking up easily when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy."
Drain the chickpeas.
You should have roughly 3 2/3 cups now.
Place the chickpeas in a food processor and process until you get a stiff paste.
"Then, with the machine sill running, add the tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt."
"Finally, slowly drizzle in the ice water and allow it to mix for about five minutes, until you get a very smooth and creamy paste."
"Transfer the hummus to a bowl, cover the surface with plastic wrap, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes."
"If not using straightaway, refrigerate."
"Q:

Double Eclipse Icon

I have a little problem when i'm installing eclipse on my elementaryOS."
"In fact, this problem persists when i'm using ubuntu gnome or unity."
"I have eclipse on my home folder, and I create a eclipse.desktop."
"The icon looks good, but when I open eclipse, another blurry icon appears (Its name is ""Java - Eclipse"") apart of the normal icon."
I want have only the normal icon.
I read about some similar troubles with the google chrome icon but the threads can't help me.
Can anyone helps me?
Thanks in advance.
"My desktop entry is on /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop

A:

That's normal behavior for eclipse.exe."
"The icon you have on your desktop is the eclipse launcher, which is not the same as the actual eclipse IDE."

"As Binance closes their doors to US Customers, a large amount of ICX trading volume goes away."
"However, as Alexander Graham Bell said, “when one door closes another one opens.” This quote rings true in the case of ICON: the open door comes as an ICX listing on the US-based Kraken cryptocurrency exchange."
Kraken released a blog post stating they will list ICX on September 12th!
"Founded in 2011, Kraken ranks #6 on CoinGecko (shown below), and #4 in terms of 24H normalized volume ($100,096,725 at the time of this writing)."
"While Kraken is based in the US, the exchange provides cryptocurrency trading services worldwide."
The significance of this listing cannot be overstated.
"Kraken is very selective in the cryptocurrencies they list, with only 21 cryptocurrencies currently listed."
"This number matches Coinbase, another selective US-based exchange."
The selectiveness of these exchanges can be attributed to strictly following US regulations and also seeking quality over quantity.
"As a comparison, Binance currently has 167 cryptocurrencies listed."
"While Binance is certainly a successful worldwide exchange, they have not stated plans to list ICX on their future US exchange, providing the way for Kraken to attract many US-based ICON investors who formerly traded on Binance."
"Additionally, Kraken offers direct deposit options, providing an avenue for direct fiat to ICX purchases."
"Kraken will list ICX/USD, ICX/EUR, ICX/XBT, and ICX/ETH trading pairs."
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday he will reshuffle his cabinet once parliament enters a mid-term break in coming months to give more responsibility to the next generation of leaders who will support his eventual successor.
"FILE PHOTO: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong attends a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (not pictured) at The Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China September 19, 2017."
"REUTERS/Lintao Zhang/Pool

Lee, the eldest son of Singapore’s founding father Lee Kuan Yew and the city-state’s third prime minister since independence in 1965, said in October he would be ready to step down in a couple of years."
"He said a new election could be called any time before early 2021, when parliament’s current term ends, and that his successor was likely to emerge from the current cabinet."
"“I will reshuffle the Cabinet after Parliament prorogues, to give the younger members more exposure and responsibility."
"This way, my successor will be supported by a stronger and more experienced team, committed to leading Singapore to a better and brighter future,” Lee said in a Facebook post."
"Singapore’s parliament is due to be suspended, or prorogued, for a mid-term break following a debate on the budget, which starts on Tuesday, and another on ministries’ spending plans."
"Parliament will re-open in May with an address by President Halimah Yacob, and Lee said on Tuesday he was asking the next generation of ministers to draft the government’s agenda for the address to “give Singaporeans a better sense of them and their thoughts”."
"SUCCESSION

Questions about succession in the wealthy Southeast Asian city state - which has been governed by the People’s Action Party (PAP) since independence - came into focus when Lee, who has twice survived cancer, fell ill during a televised speech in 2016 and stumbled at a podium."
"The Singapore media and political analysts say Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung and cabinet member Chan Chun Sing are contenders to be the island’s next leader."
"Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, also mentioned as a potential successor, has repeatedly said he does not want the job."
Former prime minister Goh Chok Tong said in a Facebook post in December he hoped Singapore’s current crop of leaders could choose Lee’s potential successor in six to nine months’ time.
"Lee responded by saying the process would probably take a little longer, local media reported."
"In the 2015 general election, the PAP won almost 70 per cent of the popular vote and swept all but six of parliament’s 89 seats."
The party’s lowest vote share was 60 percent in 2011.
Acceleration of clear cell renal cell carcinoma growth in mice following bevacizumab/Avastin treatment: the role of CXCL cytokines.
The anti-VEGF targeted antibody bevacizumab (BVZ) has been approved for treating renal cell carcinomas (RCCs).
"Although BVZ increases the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic RCC, the effect on overall survival is poor."
"To gain insight into the limited efficacy of BVZ on overall survival, we analyzed patient samples of RCC for angiogenic factors that may participate in escape from anti-VEGF therapy."
Our study shows that the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumors was increased compared with normal tissue.
"The level of interleukin-8/CXCL8, a pro-angiogenic member of the CXCL family of cytokines, was also increased in tumors."
These observations gave us a good reason to analyze the combined effects of BVZ and anti-CXCL8 antibodies on tumor growth.
"Surprisingly, we report that BVZ accelerates the growth of RCC in nude mice with in vivo selection of tumor cells with an increased growth capacity."
"Downregulation of receptor tyrosine phosphatase-κ, a phosphatase implicated in EGF receptor regulation, may partly explain this phenomenon."
Modification of the vascular network and development of lymphatic vessels through VEGF-C production and compensatory production of pro-angiogenic CXCL cytokines were also observed.
The apparent normalization of the vascular network prompted us to associate BVZ with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel.
"While efficient in vitro, paclitaxel did not reverse the anti-VEGF effects in vivo."
Anti-CXCL8-targeting antibodies were promising as they decreased intra-tumor VEGF production; decreased the pro-angiogenic CXCL/anti-angiogenic CXCL ratio and did not induce lymphangiogenesis.
These observations hold clinical implication as they highlight putative markers implicated in escape from BVZ treatment.
They also recommend proceeding with caution in the use of anti-VEGF therapy alone for treatment of RCC.

"France, 17th century:After the ""dishonorable"" death of his father and teacher, D'Artaignan vows to not become a warrior of justice anymore."
The beautiful youth is more interested in the women around him.
"However, when a cute girl shows up in his town one day, being chased by a mysterious swordsman, accompanied by ravens, his past seems to shine in a different light."
So the womanizer just can't ignore the call of his blood and of a great adventure.
"The art is great, storyline is great, action is nice, very detailed and creative design of the world where the story plays (just look at the cloths <3, that's one thing I love about those shonen-series)Overall it is really good and nice to read,...Oh yeah, but I agree it feels a little incomplete."
There are some evil people that never appear again and you never get to know their intentions and what they will do later.
"That's a shame because I really like them >_< There were actually some characters that I liked^^ (but they were just side characters meh^^)However, I think it has also some cliché shonen-characters..."
"Especially the three musketry.And I really disliked the main male (and the main female as well, but mmh...) It's not like I hated them, but it still is more pleasant to read a story with characters that you like."
"I'd recommend you that you read it for yourself to judge if it pleases you, since it is good."
Everything else that matters is just personal taste.
Male character are mature and fun.Female is more childrish but too kawaii .Really good draw.
He has done a lot of progress since Fire Emblem.I don't understand how the manga stopped after only 2 volumes ( i've got both in french ) I think it's a really good manga overall : Read it.

"Baghdad International Airport

Baghdad International Airport , previously Saddam International Airport  (),  is Iraq's largest international airport, located in a suburb about  west of downtown Baghdad in the Baghdad Governorate."
"It is the home base for Iraq's national airline, Iraqi Airways."
"History

Pre-1982
The present airport was developed under a consortium led by French company, Spie Batignolles, under an agreement made in 1979."
The Iran/Iraq war delayed full opening of the airport until 1982.
"The airport at the time was opened as Saddam International Airport, bearing the name of the then Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein."
"1982–2003
Most of Baghdad's civil flights stopped in 1991, when the United Nations imposed restrictions on Iraq after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War."
"Because of the no-fly zone imposed on Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom, Iraqi Airways was only able to continue domestic flights for limited periods."
"Internationally, Baghdad was able to receive occasional charter flights carrying medicine, aid workers, and government officials."
Royal Jordanian Airlines operated regular flights from Amman to Baghdad.
"2003–2005

In April 2003, US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq and changed the airport's name from Saddam International Airport to Baghdad International Airport."
"The ICAO code for the airport consequently changed from ORBS to ORBI; the IATA code subsequently switched from SDA to BGW, which previously referred to all Baghdad airports and before that to Al Muthana Airport when Saddam was in power."
Civilian control of the airport was returned to the Iraqi Government in 2004.
"2005–present
Sather Air Base came under fire from periodic rocket attacks from Baghdad."
On 6 December 2006 a 107 rocket attack landed 30 yards (meters) from a parked C-5A aircraft placing scores of shrapnel holes in the aircraft.
Terminal C has been refreshed with three active gate areas for carriers operating from the airport.
"In January 2015, a FlyDubai jet carrying 154 passengers was struck by gunfire as it landed at the airport."
One passenger was injured when at least three bullets struck the plane.
"After the incident, UAE carriers FlyDubai and Emirates suspended their flights from Dubai to Baghdad."
Flights by Turkish Airlines and Royal Jordanian were also temporarily suspended.
"Baghdad Airport Road, connecting to UAE
Green Zone, which was once a dangerous route full of IEDs, has been refurbished with palm trees, manicured lawns, and a fountain, with Turkish assistance."
"On 3 January 2020, a U.S. drone strike killed Qasem Soleimani, leader of Iran's Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces, as their convoy left the airport on Baghdad Airport Road."
"Military use
Within the airport there is a separate enclave called the New Al Muthana Air Base where the Iraqi Air Force's 23rd Squadron is based with three Lockheed C-130E Hercules transport aircraft."
"It is also home to a number of Sukhoi Su-25 ""Frogfoot""s.

Sather Air Base or Camp Sather was a United States Air Force base on the west side of the airport occupied from 2003 to 2011 during the Iraq War."
"It was named in memory of Combat Controller Staff Sergeant Scott Sather, the first enlisted Airman to die in Operation Iraqi Freedom."
Sather was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor for his leadership of a 24th Special Tactics Squadron reconnaissance task force during the initial stages of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
"Airport developments
On 18 May 2010, plans were unveiled for an expansion of Baghdad International Airport, which will double its capacity to 15 million passengers per year."
"The expansion, to be funded by foreign investors, will include the construction of three new terminals and the refurbishment of the existing three terminals, which will each accommodate 2.5 million passengers annually."
"Airlines and destinations

Incidents and accidents
 On 25 December 1986, Iraqi Airways Flight 163, a Boeing 737-200 flying from Baghdad to Amman, Jordan, was hijacked and damaged by a bomb in flight."
"The bomb exploded in the cockpit, causing the plane to crash in the Saudi Arabian desert, killing 63 of the 106 on board."
"On 29 November 1987, Korean Air Flight 858, a Boeing 707-3B5C, was destroyed by a bomb over the Andaman Sea."
The bomb was left by two North Korean agents who had boarded in Baghdad but got off in Abu Dhabi.
The plane was flying the Baghdad-Abu Dhabi-Bangkok-Seoul flight.
All 104 passengers and 11 crew died.
"On 22 November 2003, a European Air Transport Airbus A300B4 freighter, registered OO-DLL, operating on behalf of DHL Aviation, was hit by an SA-14 'Grail' missile shortly after takeoff."
"The airplane lost hydraulic pressure, causing a loss of control."
"After extending the landing gear to create more drag, the crew piloted the plane using differences in engine thrust and landed the plane with minimal further damage."
All three crew survived.
Civilian planes now routinely perform corkscrew landings to minimise the risk of damage from surface weapons.
"On 26 January 2015, a flydubai Boeing 737-800 flying from Dubai to Baghdad was hit by small-arms fire on approach to Baghdad International Airport with 154 passengers on board."
The plane landed safely.
"On 3 January 2020, the US Air Force launched a drone strike near the airport, killing ten people, including the general in command of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qasem Soleimani."

"Atlus Considers a Multi-Platform Launch for Persona 6

An extensive survey for Japan contrasts the opinion of the fans in the face of the publisher’s releases."
"The editor Atlus has shared with his Japanese fans a long survey aimed at knowing their opinions about future projects, letting us glimpse some of the ideas that are discussed internally."
"One of these ideas is the possibility of watching Persona 6 , among other video games, on PC, Nintendo Switch, 3DS, PS Vita, PS4, mobile phones or “something else”."
"Although the greatest emphasis is placed on this Person 6 that they have already registered , users can manifest through the survey their interest in a board game, a wrestling match, an online RPG, a RPG and strategy game, an RPG of action, a shooter, or if they are just looking for another numbered Person."
"It also exposes questions like if you want to see a new IP , spin-offs of existing series or even remakes, with the possibility of specifying even more in Soul Hackers, Devil Summoner, Devil Survivor, Person games (main, dance or fight ), Person Q, Etrian Odyssey and Shin Megami Tensei."
"In addition, it is also possible to opt for a specific study to carry it out, such as P-Studio, Vanillaware, the Etrian Odyssey team or the newly formed Studio Zero."

My Canadian roommate introduced me to maple syrup when I first moved to Montreal.You've never tried real maple syrup before?"
We need to fix that.
"She poured a little on a spoon, handed it over, and my love for the sticky sweetener began."
"In the past, I drowned my pancakes and waffles in Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth's, but pure maple syrup would be my future."
"In Canada, maple syrup is considered a standard commodity and is sold in 15 oz cans, perfect for stacking away in the cupboard."
"When I moved back to the United States, I tucked a stack of cans of maple syrup in my suitcase."
"Some were for gifts, but most were for myself."
"After leaving the land of maple syrup festivals, I thought it best to pack away as much as I could before the only syrup I could get my hands on would come in small, maple leaf-shaped containers."
This Maple Syrup Cake comes from Linda Lomelino's newly translated cookbook Lomelino's Cakes: 27 Pretty Cakes to Make Any Day Special.
I have been an admirer of Linda's blog Call Me Cupcake since I began blogging over four years ago.
"Her first cookbook was published in 2012, written in Swedish, her native tongue."
I have anxiously awaited the day it would be translated into English.
Her love of cake is pure and shines through in the way she creatively layers and decorates her desserts.
The English version of her cookbook is finally released today and cake seemed like the right way to celebrate.
"I ever so slightly adapted this recipe from her cookbook to suit the ingredients in my cupboards, substituting the almonds for pecans, and using brown sugar instead of muscovado."
The maple flavor comes through so beautifully that I had a hard time leaving the cake along long enough to frost it.
"To celebrate a love for cake, I am giving away two copies of Linda's cookbook."
"To enter this giveaway, simply comment below and share your favorite type of cake."
"The giveaway ends on Friday, November 14th, at 9:00 pm CST."
The giveaway is open to U.S. and Canadian residents who measure their ingredients in cups.
The winners will be chosen randomly and will be contacted shortly thereafter.
Edit: The giveaway is closed and the winners have been chosen.
Maple Syrup Cake with Toasted Almonds has all of the flavors of autumn.
"A little cinnamon, toasted nuts, and the sweet flavor of maple syrup form the seasonal medley."
"With maple syrup icing, the cake is complete."
"The cake recipe is written for 6-inch pans, but, since they can be difficult to come by, a larger pan could be used instead to make a single layer cake."
Spread the almonds on a rimmed baking sheet and toast for 8 minutes in the oven.
"Place in a food processor and process until the nuts resemble a coarse flour, about 1-3 minutes."
Do not overprocess.
Set aside.
"In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes."
Add in the maple syrup and beat until smooth.
Add the egg and completely incorporate it into the batter.
"Gradually add the flour, baking powder, spices, salt, and finely processed almonds."
Stir in the milk until the batter is smooth.
"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs."
Cool the layers in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.
Place the egg whites and sugars into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmer water (or a double boiler).
"Use a whisk to beat the mixture until it reaches 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), or until the sugar crystals have dissolved and do not feel grainy when rubbed between your fingers."
Remove from heat and add the maple syrup.
"In a large mixing bowl, beat the meringue until the mixture is cool and thick and forms glossy, stiff peaks, about 5-7 minutes."
Add room temperature butter a small amount at a time.
Continue beating frosting 3-5 minutes after all butter has been added.
To AssemblePlace first layer on a serving plate.
Spoon frosting into a pastry bag.
"Using a star tip, pipe circles around the top of the cake, beginning at the outer edge and working inward."
It's easier to see what you are doing if you start at the outer edge.
"If you want the cake to be higher, pipe an extra circle around the outer edge, on top of the previous circle of frosting."
Place next layer on top and repeat the piped circles.
"Place the last layer on top, cut side down, and leave the exterior unfrosted."
"Garnish with gold sprinkles, if desired."
"Pastry Affair

Pastry Affair takes a rustic, honest approach to food."
"There may be a few rough edges, imprecise cuts, and crumbs sprinkled around the table, but that is what makes it feel like home."
"Designed for the home baker, Pastry Affair features recipes covering everything from cake and cookies to Sunday brunch."
"It is a space where you will find a generous amount of butter and sugar, photography, and a whole lot of life."

"Huge increase in legal highs and psychoactive substances in Wexford

THERE has been a huge increase in the use of legal highs and psychoactive substances in Wexford, according to the Cornmarket Project."
"Paul Delaney, coordinator of the project, described the increase as alarming and said that of the 400 people who presented with substantance misuse problems last year, almost a third had used some sort of legal high in addition to other drugs."
He said that 'a surprising revelation' was that substance misuse generally began when a young person was aged between 12 and 15 years of age.
"The project, an initiative of Wexford Local Development, which helps young people to move away from anti-social behaviour as well as drugs, also looked at the links between crime and substance misuse."
"Some of the figures from 2015 show that 85 per cent of those who attended the project came through the courts, probation, solicitors or the gardai."
"In addition, nine out of 10 of those had already been misusing drugs or alcohol or both, before coming into contact with the criminal justice system."
Mr Delaney said substance misuse was also linked to the person's offence in eight out of ten cases.
"The good news, Paul Delaney said, is that just once they engage with us, typically for between 12 to 18 months, 95 per cent of the Cormarket Project's clients will successfully deal with their substance misuse, be it drugs or alcohol, and will remain out of trouble with the law in the future."
"However, he said he was concerned about the availability of the new stimulant type drugs or legal highs, which are becoming very common across Wexford."
"This is a new generation and type of drug user that we are now seeing, he said, adding that a lot of young people who previously used cannabis found that it typically calmed them."
"'However, now they are using cannabis sprayed with amphetamine type drugs that is distorting their cognitive functions and making them hyper."
"In addition, there are many tablets and pills containing these new psychoactive substances and they are very cheap to buy over the internet,' said Mr Delaney."
He said that the project has already held discussions with their colleagues in the HSE to see how they might put in place an adequate response on a multi-agency basis to this new threat.
"In 2013 the Wexford Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Force estimated that the illegal drugs trade in Wexford was worth about €10 million a year, but if these new psychoactive substances get a grip in the county, then it will be well in excess of that in the future, said Mr Delaney."
"Talking to this newspaper, he said that after most head shops were closed in 2010, wholesalers abroad began offering substances to anyone willing to pay for them."
"'They would sell anything from a gramme to a kilogramme to a bucket full and they found a ready market among people who had been buying substances from head shops,' said Mr Delaney."
"He said that while Ireland had some of the strongest legislation in Europe against 'illegal' substances, as soon as a substance was banned, the wholesalers were working around the law by getting the chemical composition changed which meant it was not illegal to import it until the legislation was again updated, in a cat and mouse process."
"The Cornmarket figures for 2015 will be officially released tomorrrow (Wednesday, July 27)."

"Field of the Invention
The invention relates generally to electric power tools, and more particularly to power tools equipped with variable speed switches for varying tool speed."
2.
"Reference to Prior Art
In some power tools, tool speed can be varied by controlling the pressure applied to the trigger."
"However, varying trigger pressure may not be an acceptable way to vary tool speed since holding a trigger in a less than fully depressed position causes fatigue and accurate trigger control is difficult."
It is known to provide electric tools with slide switches to vary tool speed when the trigger of the tool is fully depressed.
"However, a slide switch only provides an operator with a choice of high and low speeds."
It is also known to provide an electric tool with a variable speed switch which is useful regardless of power line voltage and which employs a potentiometer that is adjustable with a thumb wheel to control tool speed.
Thumb wheel adjustment permits an operator to simply dial in a desired tool speed when the trigger is fully depressed.
Prior art variable speed switch assemblies include multiple components and considerable care must be exercised to insure that the components are properly assembled to form the switch unit.
"Some of these components, such as the thumb wheel for example, must be made of costly heat resistant materials to withstand the temperatures generated when the potentiometer is soldered to a circuit board."
"Furthermore, care must be taken to avoid damaging prior art switch assemblies through normal use."
"For example, mechanical stops within the potentiometer absorb energy exerted by an operator when the thumb wheel reaches the limits of potentiometer adjustment range."
"Bela Soos

Bela Soos (, born Târgu Mureș, 2 March 1930 - died Frankfurt, 12 September 2007) was a Romanian chess player who was awarded the title of International Master in 1967."
"As a youth, he was a keen football player, representing Dinamo Bucharest during his military service."
"He represented Romania in 4 chess olympiads in 1956, 1962, 1966 and 1968, before defecting to West Germany in the early 1970s."
"Following his defection, all further mention of him was suppressed in Romanian publications."
"He is noted for two wins over leading Soviet grandmaster Efim Geller, including a crushing win in 23 moves at the 1962 olympiad in Varna, Bulgaria."

Press Release

Libertarians fight to break cycle of battered gay voter syndrome

WASHINGTON - Like abused spouses who keep returning to their aggressors, gay voters keep handing their votes to the Democrats who abuse them."
The Libertarian Party (LP) wants to break this self-destructive behavior and offers LGBT voters a better alternative.
"LP Chairman Mark Hinkle said, ""Exit polls indicate that Democrats get over 70% of LGBT votes in federal elections."
"Those voters must really love the Democrats' rhetoric, because they certainly aren't seeing any action."
"""President Obama and the Democrats had almost a year of complete control of the federal government: the Presidency, the House, and a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate."
They could have repealed 'don't ask don't tell.'
They could have gotten rid of the Defense of Marriage Act.
But they didn't do either of those things.

Introduction
============

Roughly speaking, a classification problem consists of a class of objects together with an equivalence relation telling us which objects to identify; a solution to this problem is then an ‘effective’ or ‘concrete’ description of the quotient, preferably by a ‘system of complete invariants’."
"What constitutes a reasonably concrete or effective solution to a classification problem, however, might depend on one’s purposes or even one’s taste."
Descriptive set-theory proposes smoothness to be the decisive indication that a classification is explicit and/or concrete (see for instance [@HKL; @Hjo] for a discussion).
"More precisely, recall that a *Polish* space is a complete metric space containing a countable dense subset."
Considering a Polish space to be concrete is justified by the fact that its underlying Borel structure is in essence equal to the standard Borel space $\mathbb R$.
"With this in mind, an equivalence relation on a Polish space, and by extension, the classification problem it encodes, is called *smooth* if there is a Borel map to a Polish space which factors through the quotient."
"A more suggestive, albeit slightly less precise formulation is that, up to a Borel isomorphism, equivalence classes are completely classified by real numbers."
"Most classification problems in algebraic geometry, like classifying varieties over a fixed [algebraically closed field]{}  up to isomorphism or up to bi-rational equivalence, are not known to be smooth."
"Of course, this is in no way preventing geometers to seriously, and often successfully, work on these classification problems."
It would be nice to know though what their descriptive set-theoretical status is.
"In this paper, I will propose a *local* classification problem, which will fall at the right side of the dividing line: one can ‘concretely’, that is to say, smoothly, classify germs of points on arbitrary Noetherian schemes up to similarity (a slightly weaker equivalence relation than the isomorphism relation)."
"Using this general result, we can also deduce some smoothness results for certain isomorphism problems."
"For *analytic germs*, that is to say, formal completions of germs (in the sense of [@Hart II.9]), we have:

\[T:formgerm\] The classification, up to isomorphism, of analytic germs over an [algebraically closed field]{} of size the continuum, is smooth."
"This also enables us to obtain a smooth classification problem of a more global nature, namely for projective schemes together with a choice of a very ample line bundle, the so-called *polarized schemes*."
"\[T:pol\] The classification, up to isomorphism, of polarized schemes over an [algebraically closed field]{} of size the continuum, is smooth."
"For the proof of our main smoothness result, we associate to a point its local ring, thus reducing the problem to the study of the category of all Noetherian local rings."
"If we were to classify these only up to isomorphism, then as part of this problem, we would have to classify already all fields, and even for countable fields [@FriSta] or fields of finite transcendence degree [@ThoVel] these are non-smooth problems."
"Hence to circumvent this arithmetical obstruction, we can either fix the residue field—the route taken for the two isomorphism problems stated above—or, otherwise, allow for ‘extensions of scalars’, resulting in the identification of any two fields of the same [characteristic]{}."
"Even after taking the latter modification, the local classification problem is probably still not smooth."
"We introduce one further identification, inspired in part by Grothendieck’s suggestion that one should consider working in the etale topos instead of the (classical) Zariski topos."
"A down-to-earth interpretation of this point of view is that two local rings can be considered identical if they have a common etale extension, or more generally, if they have the same completion."
"In summary, we say that two Noetherian local rings are *similar* if they can be made isomorphic by an *analytic extension of scalars*, that is to say, by the process of extending scalars and taking completion."
"To also make sense of this in mixed [characteristic]{}, we subsume these types of extensions under the larger class consisting of all formally etale (=unramified and faithfully flat) extensions."
We will show that *similar* points (meaning that their corresponding local rings are similar) have the same type of singularity (see Theorem \[T:transsim\]).
"As a spinoff of this investigation, we obtain a flatness criterion generalizing a result of Kollár:

Let $R\to S$ be a local [homomorphism]{} between Noetherian local rings and suppose $R$ is an excellent normal domain with perfect residue field."
"If ${\operatorname}{dim}(R)={\operatorname}{dim}(S)$ and $R\to S$ is unramified, then $R\to S$ is faithfully flat."
"Our assertion that classifying points up to similarity is smooth is established by effectively putting a metric on the space of similarity classes ${\mathbb{Sim}}$, called the *[jet]{} metric*."
"We will prove that the induced topology is complete, and that the collection of similarity classes of Artinian local rings with a finitely generated residue field is a countable dense subset."
This shows that ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ is a Polish space and hence classification up to similarity is a smooth problem.
The [jet]{} metric on ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ is induced by a semi-metric on the class of all Noetherian local rings.
"In terms of (germs of) points, this semi-metric measures to which order the [jet]{}[s]{} of two points agree."
"In fact, the proof yields that for classification up to similarity, the collection of all [jet]{}[s]{} of a point form a complete set of invariants."
"So far, all concepts are algebraic-geometric in nature, but the existence of limits relies on a tool from model-theory, to wit, the ultraproduct construction."
"Of course, the ultraproduct of Noetherian local rings is in general no longer Noetherian."
"However, if we have a Cauchy sequence of Noetherian local rings, then their *cproduct*, obtained by killing all infinitesimals in the ultraproduct, yields a complete Noetherian local ring, which, up to similarity, is the limit of the sequence."
"Limits and ultraproducts
========================

Let $(\Sigma,d)$ be a *semi-metric space*."
"In this paper, we understand this to mean that the semi-metric is *non-archimedean*, that is to say, $d(x,y)\leq\max\{d(x,z),d(y,z)\}$ for all $x,y,z\in\Sigma$, and *bounded*, that is to say, after possibly normalizing the metric, $d(x,y)\leq 1$ for all $x,y\in\Sigma$."
"We call $d$ a *metric*, if $d(x,y)=0$ [if and only if]{} $x=y$."
"To include the [jet]{}metric in our treatment, we allow for $\Sigma $ to be merely a class."
"We say that two elements $r,s\in\Sigma$ are *$d$-equivalent*, written $r\sim_d s$, if $d(r, s)=0$."
"The quotient space $\Sigma/\sim_d$ has an induced semi-metric which is in fact a metric; we therefore call this quotient the *metrization* of $(\Sigma,d)$."
"Let $({\Sigma\mathstrut_{w}},{d\mathstrut_{w}})$ be semi-metric spaces, for $w\in{\mathbb N}$."
We will identify the elements of the product $\Pi:=\prod_w{\Sigma\mathstrut_{w}}$ with the sequences $\mathbf r\colon{\mathbb N}\to \Pi$ such that $\mathbf r(w)\in{\Sigma\mathstrut_{w}}$ for each $w$.
"The *product semi-metric* on $\Pi$ is given by letting the distance $d(\mathbf r,\mathbf s)$ between two sequences $\mathbf r$ and $\mathbf s$ be the lim-inf of the distances ${d\mathstrut_{w}}(\mathbf r(w),\mathbf s(w))(\leq 1)$ of their respective components."
"Below, we will introduce weaker semi-metrics on $\Pi$, induced by ultrafilters."
"Cauchy sequences {#cauchy-sequences .unnumbered}
----------------

Let $\mathbf r$ be a sequence in $\Sigma$ (meaning that all $\mathbf
r(w)\in\Sigma$) and let $\mathbf r^+$ be its *twist*, given as the sequence whose $w$-th element is $\mathbf r(w+1)$."
We call $\mathbf r$ a *Cauchy sequence* if $\mathbf r\sim\mathbf r^+$ (with respect to the product semi-metric).
"One verifies that $\mathbf r$ is a Cauchy sequence, if for each $\varepsilon >0$, there exists an $N$ such that $d(\mathbf r(w),\mathbf r(v))< \varepsilon$ for all $v,w>N$, and that two Cauchy sequences $\mathbf r$ and $\mathbf s$ are equivalent if for each $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $N$ such that $d(\mathbf r(w),\mathbf s(w))<\varepsilon$ for all $w>N$."
"Let ${{\operatorname}{Cau}(\Sigma,d)}$, or simply, ${{\operatorname}{Cau}(\Sigma)} $, denote the set of all Cauchy sequences in $\Sigma $ with the induced product semi-metric."
"There is a natural isometry $\Sigma\to
{{\operatorname}{Cau}(\Sigma)} $ sending $x$ to the constant sequence $\mathbf x$ given as $\mathbf x(w):=x$; we will identify the element $x$ with its constant sequence in ${{\operatorname}{Cau}(\Sigma)} $."
A *limit* of a sequence $\mathbf r$ is an element $x\in \Sigma $ such that $\mathbf r\sim x$.
"It is easy to see that if $\mathbf r$ has a limit, then it must be Cauchy."
"We call $(\Sigma,d)$ *complete* if every Cauchy sequence has a unique limit."
This implies in particular that $d$ is a metric.
"We define the *completion* of $(\Sigma,d)$ as the metrization ${\widehat {\Sigma}}:= {{\operatorname}{Cau}(\Sigma)}/\sim$ of the semi-metric space ${{\operatorname}{Cau}(\Sigma)}$; it is a complete metric space containing $\Sigma $ as a dense subspace."
"Adic metric {#adic-metric .unnumbered}
-----------

A local ring $(R,{\mathfrak m})$ comes with a canonical semi-metric, its *${\mathfrak m}$-adic semi-metric* defined as follows: the *order* of an element $x\in R$ is the supremum of all $n$ for which $x\in{\mathfrak m}^n$; the distance $d_R(x,y)$ between two elements is then equal to $2^{-n}$ where $n$ is the order of $x-y$ (we allow the case $n=\infty$, with the convention that $2^{-\infty}=0$)."
"The subset of all elements which are $d_R$-equivalent to zero forms an ideal, equal to the intersection of all the powers ${\mathfrak m}^n$; it is called the *ideal of infinitesimals* of $R$ and is denoted ${{\operatorname}{Inf}(R)}$."
"By Krull’s intersection theorem, if $R$ is Noetherian, then ${{\operatorname}{Inf}(R)}=0$."
The completion of $R$ in the ${\mathfrak m}$-adic semi-metric will be denoted ${\widehat {R}}$.
"If $R$ has finite embedding dimension, then ${\widehat {R}}$ is a complete Noetherian local ring by [@SchFinEmb Theorem 2.2]."
"Below, we will define a semi-metric on the class of all Noetherian local rings, not to be confused with the adic metric on a single Noetherian local ring."
"To calculate limits in the former semi-metric, we need a notion from model-theory: the ultraproduct construction (some references for ultraproducts are [@EkUP; @Hod; @Roth; @SchUlBook], or the brief review in [@SchNSTC §2]) ."
"Ultraproducts and cproducts {#ultraproducts-and-cproducts .unnumbered}
---------------------------

Let $({R\mathstrut_{w}},{{\mathfrak m}\mathstrut_{w}})$, for $w\in{\mathbb N}$, be a sequence of Noetherian local rings."
"Let $\mathcal U$ be an ultrafilter on ${\mathbb N}$, which we always assume to be non-principal."
"The *ultraproduct* of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ with respect to $\mathcal U$, denoted ${R\mathstrut_\natural}$, is obtained from the product $\Pi:=\prod_w{R\mathstrut_{w}}$ by modding out the ideal of all sequences almost all of whose entries are zero (it is customary to use the expression “almost all” to mean “all indices belonging to a member of the ultrafilter”)."
"The particular choice[^1] of ultrafilter $\mathcal U$ does not matter for our purposes, and hence we do not include it in our notation."
"Although not useful for proving results, let me recall an alternative construction from [@SchUlBook Theorem 2.5.4]: there exists a minimal prime ideal ${\mathfrak g}$ of the Cartesian power ${\mathbb Z}^{\mathbb N}$, containing the direct sum ideal ${\mathbb Z}^{({\mathbb N})}$, such that ${R\mathstrut_\natural}=\Pi/{\mathfrak g}\Pi$, where we view the Cartesian product $\Pi$ as an algebra over ${\mathbb Z}^{\mathbb N}$ in the natural way; and conversely, any such prime ideal determines in this way an ultraproduct of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$."
"The ultraproduct ${R\mathstrut_\natural}$ is again a local ring, with maximal ideal ${{\mathfrak m}\mathstrut_\natural}$ given as the ultraproduct of the ${{\mathfrak m}\mathstrut_{w}}$."
"In general, however, ${R\mathstrut_\natural}$ will no longer be Noetherian."
"If almost all ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ have embedding dimension at most $n$, then so does ${R\mathstrut_\natural}$."
"A key role will played by the homomorphic image of ${R\mathstrut_\natural}$ modulo its ideal of infinitesimals ${{\operatorname}{Inf}({R\mathstrut_\natural})}$, which we call the *cproduct* of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ and which we denote by ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$."
"A more direct way for defining the cproduct, although less useful in proofs, is as follows: on the product $\Pi$, the ultrafilter $\mathcal U$ induces a semi-metric $d_{\mathcal U}$ by the condition that $d_{\mathcal U}(\mathbf r,\mathbf
s)\leq \varepsilon$ for some $\varepsilon$ [if and only if]{}  $d_{{R\mathstrut_{w}}}(\mathbf r(w),\mathbf s(w))\leq
\varepsilon$ for almost all $w$."
"The cproduct is then the metrization of $(\Pi, d_{\mathcal U})$, that is to say, the residue ring of the product modulo the ideal of all sequences which are $d_{\mathcal U}$-equivalent to zero."
"If almost all ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ have embedding dimension at most $n$, then so does the cataproduct ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$."
"Moreover, by the saturatedness property of ultraproducts, the cproduct is a complete local ring, whence Noetherian by [@Mats Theorem 29.4] (for more details see [@SchFinEmb Lemma 5.6] or [@SchUlBook Theorem 12.1.4])."
The same argument also shows that the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ and their completions ${{\widehat {R}}\mathstrut_{w}}$ have the same cproduct.
"We will only consider cproducts of Noetherian local rings of bounded embedding dimension, so that we tacitly may assume that they are complete and Noetherian."
"In case all ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ are equal to a fixed Noetherian local ring $R$, then their ultraproduct ${R\mathstrut_\natural}$ and cproduct ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ are called, respectively, the *ultrapower* and *cpower* of $R$."
"By [Łos’ Theorem]{}, ultrapowers commute with base change, that is to say ${(R/I)\mathstrut_\natural}{\cong}{R\mathstrut_\natural}/I{R\mathstrut_\natural}$; the same is true for cpowers by [@SchFinEmb Corollary 5.7]:

\[L:ulsepbc\] If $R$ is a Noetherian local ring and $I$ an ideal in $R$, then ${ (R/I)\mathstrut_\sharp}={R\mathstrut_\sharp}/I{R\mathstrut_\sharp}$."
"Scalar extensions {#s:scext}
=================

Cohen’s structure theorems for complete Noetherian local rings will play an essential role in this paper, so we quickly review the relevant properties; a good reference for all this is [@Mats §29]."
"Cohen’s structure theorems {#cohens-structure-theorems .unnumbered}
--------------------------

For each field $\kappa$ of prime [characteristic]{} $p$, there exists a unique complete [discrete valuation ring]{}$V$ of [characteristic]{} zero whose residue field is $\kappa$ and whose maximal ideal is $pV$; we call $V$ the *complete $p$-ring* over $\kappa$."
Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring with residue field $\kappa$.
"We say that $R$ has *equal [characteristic]{}* if $R$ and $\kappa$ have the same [characteristic]{}; in the remaining case, we say that $R$ has *mixed [characteristic]{}*."
Assume $R$ is moreover complete and let $X$ be a finite tuple of indeterminates.
"Cohen’s structure theorems now claim, among other things, the following:

-   if $R$ has equal [characteristic]{}, then it is a homomorphic image of ${\kappa[[X]]}$;

-   if $R$ has mixed [characteristic]{}, then it is a homomorphic image of ${V[[X]]}$, where $V$ is the complete $p$-ring over $\kappa$."
"Let $(R,{\mathfrak m})$ be a Noetherian local with residue field $\kappa$ and let $\lambda$ be a field extension of $\kappa$."
"With a *scalar extension of $R$ over $\lambda$* we mean a local $R$-algebra $(S,\mathfrak n)$ with residue field $ \lambda $ such that $R\to S$ is faithfully flat, $\mathfrak
n={\mathfrak m}S$ and $R\to S$ induces the embedding $\kappa\subseteq \lambda$ on the residue fields."
A *scalar extension* of a local ring $R$ is then a scalar extension of $R$ over some field extension of its residue field.
The condition that $\mathfrak n={\mathfrak m}S$ is also expressed by saying that $R\to S$ has *trivial closed fiber* or that it is *unramified*.
"In other words, a scalar extension is the same as an unramified, faithfully flat [homomorphism]{} (also called a *formally etale* extension)."
"By [@EGA $0_{III}$ 10.3.1], for any Noetherian local ring $R$ and any extension $l$ of its residue field, at least one scalar extension of $R$ over $l$ exists; we will reprove this in Corollary \[C:scal\] below."
"\[P:scalfact\] Consider the following commutative triangle of local [homomorphism]{}[s]{} between Noetherian local rings [$${\newcommand{\tmpprop}{q} 
\if\tmpprop{q}\relax\else \label{}\fi}
\begin{aligned}\mbox{

\put(83,43){\makebox(0,0)[l]{$h$}}
\end{picture}}
\end{aligned}$$]{} If any two are scalar extensions, then so is the third."
It is clear that the composition of two scalar extensions is again scalar.
Assume $g$ and $h$ are scalar extensions.
Then $f$ is faithfully flat and ${\mathfrak m}T={\mathfrak p}=\mathfrak nT$.
"Since $g$ is faithfully flat, we get ${\mathfrak m}S={\mathfrak m}T\cap S=\mathfrak nT\cap S=\mathfrak n$, showing that $f$ is also a scalar extension."
"Finally, assume $f$ and $h$ are scalar extensions."
"Let $$\label{eq:ffR}
\dots R^{b_2}\to R^{b_1}\to R\to R/{\mathfrak m}\to 0$$ be a free resolution of $R/{\mathfrak m}$."
"Since $S$ is flat over $R$, tensoring yields a free resolution $$\label{eq:ffS}
\dots S^{b_2}\to S^{b_1}\to S\to S/{\mathfrak m}S\to 0.$$ By assumption $S/{\mathfrak m}S$ is the residue field $\lambda$ of $S$."
"Therefore, ${\operatorname{Tor}^{S}_{\bullet}(T,\lambda)} $ can be calculated as the homology of the complex $$\label{eq:ffT}
\dots T^{b_2}\to T^{b_1}\to T\to T/{\mathfrak m}T\to 0$$ obtained from by the base change $S\to T$."
"However, can also be obtained by tensoring over $R$ with $T$."
"Since $T$ is flat over $R$, the sequence is exact, whence, in particular, ${\operatorname{Tor}^{S}_{1}(T,\lambda)} =0$."
"By the local flatness criterion, $T$ is flat over $S$."
"Since $\mathfrak n ={\mathfrak m}S$ and ${\mathfrak p}={\mathfrak m}T$, we get ${\mathfrak p}=\mathfrak nT$, showing that $g$, too, is a scalar extension."
Three important examples of scalar extensions are given by the following proposition.
\[P:ulsepsc\] Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring.
1.
\[i:compsc\] The natural map $R\to {\widehat {R}}$ is a scalar extension.
2.
\[i:et\] Any etale map is a scalar extension.
3.
"\[i:ulsepsc\] The natural map $R\to {R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is a scalar extension, where ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is any cpower of $R$."
"The first two assertions are well-known, so remains to show the last."
Let ${\mathfrak m}$ be the maximal ideal of $R$.
It is easy to show that ${\mathfrak m}{R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is the maximal ideal of ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$.
"So remains to prove that $R\to
{R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is flat."
"Since ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is complete, and in fact equal to the catapower of ${\widehat {R}}$, we may assume without loss of generality that $R$ is already complete."
"In particular, $R$ is a homomorphic image of a regular local ring and if we prove the corresponding result for this regular local ring, then base change yields the desired result by Lemma \[L:ulsepbc\]."
"Therefore, we may moreover assume that $R$ is regular."
"Since ${\mathfrak m}{R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is the maximal ideal of ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ and since ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is also regular by [@SchFinEmb Corollary 5.15], of the same dimension as $R$, the flatness of $R\to {R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ then follows from [@Mats Theorem 23.1]."
"In fact, \[P:ulsepsc\] has the following converse: if $R\to S$ is essentially of finite type inducing a finite separable extension on the residue fields, then $R\to S$ is a scalar extension [if and only if]{} it is etale."
"In this sense, scalar extensions are generalizations of etale maps (whence the alternative terminology ‘formally etale’ for them)."
This shows already that classification up to scalar extension is a reasonable and interesting problem.
"To gather further support for this claim, we will now explore how closely related scalar extensions are to isomorphisms."
"An important observation in that direction, one we will use several times below, is that a scalar extension of complete Noetherian local rings inducing an isomorphism on their residue fields is itself an isomorphism; see [@Mats Theorem 8.4]."
Hence it is of interest to generate scalar extensions $R\to S$ with $S$ complete.
We will see that there exists a canonical choice over any field.
"Completions along a residual extension {#completions-along-a-residual-extension .unnumbered}
--------------------------------------

Let $(R,{\mathfrak m})$ be a Noetherian local ring with residue field $\kappa$, and let $\lambda$ be a field extension of $\kappa$."
"The *completion of $R$ along $\lambda $* is the (unique) local $R$-algebra ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ solving the following universal problem: given an arbitrary Noetherian local $R$-algebra $S$ with residue field $\lambda $, if $S$ is complete, then there exists a unique local $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} \to S$."
"When $\kappa=\lambda$, we recover the usual completion ${{\widehat {R}}^{\kappa}}={\widehat {R}}$ of $R$."
"Here and elsewhere, we say that there is a *unique* [homomorphism]{} with certain properties, when we actually mean that there exists a unique [homomorphism]{} *up to isomorphism*; this is consistent with our practice of identifying two local rings when they are isomorphic."
"### Proof of the existence of a completion along $\lambda $ {#proof-of-the-existence-of-a-completion-along-lambda .unnumbered}

We have to treat the equal and mixed [characteristic]{} cases separately."
Assume first that $R$ has equal [characteristic]{} (this case is also discussed in [@HHFreg (6.3)]).
"By Cohen’s structure theorems, there exists an embedding $\kappa\to
{\widehat {R}}$."
Let ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}$ be the ${\mathfrak m}({\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_\kappa\lambda)$-adic completion of ${\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_\kappa\lambda$.
"To see that this is a completion along $\lambda$, let $S$ be a Noetherian local $R$-algebra with residue field $\lambda $ and assume $S$ is complete."
"By the universal property of ordinary completions, we get a unique [homomorphism]{} ${\widehat {R}}\to S$."
"Since $S$ is complete, we can find an embedding $\lambda\to S$ which agrees on the subfield $\kappa$ of $\lambda $ with the composition $\kappa\to {\widehat {R}}\to S$."
"By the universal property of tensor products, the two maps ${\widehat {R}}\to S$ and $\lambda\to S$ combine to a unique local $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{}${\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_\kappa \lambda\to S$, and using once more the universal property of completion, this then yields a unique $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to S$."
"In the mixed [characteristic]{} case, coefficient fields no longer exist and we now proceed as follows."
"Let $V$ be the (unique) complete $p$-ring over $\kappa$, where $p$ is the [characteristic]{} of $\kappa$."
"We first define the completion of $V$ along $\lambda $, that is to say, ${{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}} $, as the unique complete $p$-ring over $\lambda $."
That the latter satisfies the universal property of a completion along $\lambda $ is proven in [@Mats Theorem 29.2].
"To define ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $, let $S$ be any Noetherian local $R$-algebra with residue field $\lambda $ extending $\kappa$, and assume $S$ is complete."
"As before, we have a unique local $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${\widehat {R}}\to S$."
"By Cohen’s structure theorems, there exists a commutative diagram of local [homomorphism]{}[s]{} V[V ]{} [R]{} [S.]{} By the universal property of tensor products, we get a unique $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_V{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}\to
S$."
"Define ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ now as the ${\mathfrak m}({\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_V{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}})$-adic completion of ${\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_V{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}} $, so that we get a unique local $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to S$, as required."
"\[C:scal\] For every Noetherian local ring $R$ and every extension field $\lambda $ of its residue field, ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $, the completion of $R$ along $\lambda $, exists and is unique."
"For every ideal $I$ in $R$, the completion of $R/I$ along $\lambda $ is equal to ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}/I{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $."
"Moreover, the natural map $R\to {{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is a scalar extension over $\lambda $."
Existence was proven above; uniqueness then follows formally from being a solution to a universal problem.
"To prove the second assertion, assume $R/I\to S$ is a local [homomorphism]{} with $S$ a complete Noetherian local ring with residue field $\lambda $."
The composition $R\to R/I\to S$ yields by definition a unique local $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to S$.
"Since $IS=0$, the latter [homomorphism]{} factors through ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}/I{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $, showing that ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}/I{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ satisfies the universal property of completions along $\lambda $."
"As for the last assertion, in the equal [characteristic]{}case, the base change ${\widehat {R}}\to {\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_\kappa \lambda $ of $\kappa\sub \lambda $ is faithfully flat."
"Since completion is exact, each map in $$R\to {\widehat {R}}\to {\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_\kappa \lambda\to {{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}$$ is faithfully flat, whence so is their composition."
"In the mixed [characteristic]{} case, ${{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}} $ is torsion-free whence flat over $V$."
"Hence by the same argument as in the equal [characteristic]{} case, the composite map $$R\to {\widehat {R}}\to {\widehat {R}}{\otimes}_V{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}\to {{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}$$ is faithfully flat."
"By our second assertion, ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}/{\mathfrak m}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is the completion of $R/{\mathfrak m}{\cong}\kappa$ along $\lambda $ in either [characteristic]{}."
"In other words, ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}/{\mathfrak m}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\cong}\lambda $ and hence in particular, ${\mathfrak m}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is the maximal ideal of ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $."
This proves that $R\to {{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is a scalar extension.
\[P:compscal\] Let $R\to S$ be a scalar extension over $\lambda $.
"If $S$ is complete, then $S{\cong}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $."
"By the universal property, we have a local $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to S$."
It follows from [@Mats Theorem 8.4] that ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to S$ is surjective.
"Since $R\to
{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ and $R\to S$ are scalar extensions by Corollary \[C:scal\] and by assumption respectively, ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to S$ is faithfully flat by Proposition \[P:scalfact\], whence injective."
\[C:liftscal\] Let $R\to S$ be a scalar extension with $S$ complete.
"If $R$ is the homomorphic image of a Noetherian local ring $A$, then there exists a scalar extension $A\to B$ whose base change is $R\to S$, that is to say, $S=B{\otimes}_AR$."
"We leave it to the reader to verify that, after taking completions, we may assume that also $A$ and $R$ are complete."
"By Cohen’s structure theorems, $A$ and $R$ are the homomorphic images of ${V[[X]]}$ modulo some ideals $J\sub I$ respectively, where $V$ is either their common residue field or otherwise a complete $p$-ring over that residue field, and where $X$ is a finite tuple of indeterminates."
"Moreover, $S{\cong}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ by Proposition \[P:compscal\], where $\lambda $ is the residue field of $S$."
"In particular, $S{\cong}{{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}[[X]]}/I{{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}[[X]]}$."
"Hence putting $B:={{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}[[X]]}/J{{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}[[X]]}$ yields a scalar extension $A\to B$ with $A/IA=R\to
B/IB=S$, as required."
The following result is a sharpening of [@OlbSaySha Theorem 2.4].
\[C:ulsepscal\] Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring with residue field $\kappa$.
"If ${\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}$ is the ultrapower of $\kappa$, then the cpower ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ of $R$ is equal to the completion ${{\widehat {R}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}}$ along ${\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}$."
"By Lemma \[L:ulsepbc\], the residue field of ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is ${\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}$."
"Since $R\to {R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is a scalar extension by \[P:ulsepsc\]\[i:ulsepsc\], and since ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is complete, ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}{\cong}{{\widehat {R}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}}$ by Proposition \[P:compscal\]."
\[C:finscal\] Let $R\to S$ be a finite local [homomorphism]{} inducing a trivial extension on the residue fields.
"For every extension $\lambda $ of this common residue field, ${{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}}{\cong}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS$."
The base change $S\to {{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS$ is faithfully flat.
Let ${\mathfrak m}$ and $\mathfrak n$ be the maximal ideals of $R$ and $S$ respectively.
Since $$({{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS)/\mathfrak n({{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS){\cong}({{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}/{\mathfrak m}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}){\otimes}_{R/{\mathfrak m}} (S/\mathfrak n){\cong}\lambda{\otimes}_\kappa\kappa= \lambda$$ the ideal $\mathfrak n({{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS)$ is a maximal ideal.
"Since the base change ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to {{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS$ is finite with trivial residue field extension and since ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is complete whence Henselian, ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS$ is a complete local ring."
"Hence we showed that $S\to  {{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\otimes}_RS$ is a scalar extension and since the latter ring is complete with residue field equal to $\lambda $, it is isomorphic to ${{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} $ by Proposition \[P:compscal\]."
\[C:scalreg\] Suppose $R$ is an excellent local ring.
"If $R\to S$ is a scalar extension inducing a separable extension on the residue fields, then $R\to S$ is a regular [homomorphism]{}."
"By [@Mats Theorem 28.10], the scalar extension $R\to S$ is formally smooth, since it is unramified and the residue field extension is separable."
The assertion now follows from a result by André in [@And] (see also [@Mats p. 260]).
"In fact, with aid of Proposition \[P:compscal\], Corollary \[C:liftscal\] and Cohen’s structure theorems, one reduces to proving that ${V[[X]]}\to {{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}[[X]]}$ is regular, where $V$ is either a field or a complete $p$-ring, and where $\lambda $ is a separable extension of the residue field of $V$."
This approach circumvents the use of André’s deep result.
"\[D:irr\] A Noetherian local ring $R$ is called *analytically irreducible*, if ${\widehat {R}}$ is a domain; it is called *absolutely analytically irreducible*, if ${{\widehat {R}}^{{\kappa^{\text{alg}}}}}$ is a domain, where ${\kappa^{\text{alg}}}$ is the algebraic closure of the residue field $\kappa$ of $R$; and it is called *universally irreducible*, if any scalar extension of $R$ is a domain."
"If $R$ is an excellent normal local domain with perfect residue field, then $R$ is universally irreducible."
Let $S$ be a scalar extension of $R$.
"By Corollary \[C:scalreg\], the map $R\to S$ is regular and hence $S$ is again normal by [@Mats Theorem 32.2], whence a domain."
A Noetherian local ring is absolutely analytically irreducible [if and only if]{} it is universally irreducible.
"Since we will make no essential use of this result, we only give a sketch of a proof."
One direction is obvious.
"For the other, we may reduce to the case that $R$ is a complete Noetherian local domain with algebraically closed residue field $\kappa$."
"We need to show that ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is a domain, where $\lambda $ is an arbitrary extension field of $\kappa$."
"By Cohen’s structure theorems, there exists a finite extension $S:={V[[X]]}\sub R$, where $V$ is either $\kappa$ or the complete $p$-ring over $\kappa$, and $X$ is a tuple of indeterminates."
"Write $R={S[Y]}/{\mathfrak p}$ for some finite tuple of indeterminates $Y$, so that ${\mathfrak p}$ is in particular a prime ideal."
"Since the fraction field of ${{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} ={{{\widehat {V}}^{\lambda}}[[X]]}$ is a regular extension of the fraction field of $S={V[[X]]}$, the same argument as in the proof of [@SchAsc Lemma 5.21] then shows that ${\mathfrak p}{{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}}[Y]}$ is a prime ideal."
"Hence we are done, since ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} ={{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}}[Y]}/{\mathfrak p}{{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}}[Y]}$ by Corollary \[C:finscal\]."
We are ready to formulate a flatness criterion generalizing [@Kol Theorem 8]; we prove a slightly stronger version than the one quoted in the introduction.
\[T:ff\] Let $R\to S$ be a local [homomorphism]{} of Noetherian local rings.
"Assume $R$ is universally irreducible, e.g., an excellent normal local domain with perfect residue field, or a complete local domain with algebraically closed residue field."
"If $R\to S$ is unramified and ${\operatorname}{dim}(R)={\operatorname}{dim}(S)$, then $R\to S$ is faithfully flat, whence a scalar extension."
"Recall that $(R,{\mathfrak m})\to(S,\mathfrak n)$ being unramified means that $\mathfrak
n={\mathfrak m}S$."
It suffices to prove the assertion under the additional assumption that both $R$ and $S$ are complete.
"Indeed, if $R\to S$ is arbitrary, then ${\widehat {R}}\to {\widehat {S}}$ satisfies again the hypotheses of the theorem and therefore would be faithfully flat."
"By an easy descent argument, $R\to S$ is then also faithfully flat."
So assume $R$ and $S$ are complete and let $\lambda $ be the residue field of $S$.
"By assumption, ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is a domain, of the same dimension as $R$."
"By the universal property of the completion along $\lambda $, we get a local $R$-algebra [homomorphism]{} ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\to S$."
"By [@Mats Theorem 8.4], this [homomorphism]{} is surjective."
"It is also injective, since ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ and $S$ have the same dimension and ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ is a domain."
"Hence ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\cong}S$, so that $R\to S$ is a scalar extension."
"Similarity relation {#s:sim}
===================

Next, we introduce an equivalence relation on the class of Noetherian local rings which, although coarser than the isomorphism relation, preserves most local singularity properties (see for instance Theorem \[T:transsim\] below)."
"Namely, we say that two Noetherian local rings $R$ and $S$ are *similar*, denoted $R\approx S$, if they admit a common scalar extension."
Let $T$ be this common scalar extension.
"Its completion is again a scalar extension and by Proposition \[P:compscal\], it is therefore isomorphic to both ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ and ${{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} $, where $\lambda $ is the residue field of $T$."
"In other words, we showed that $R\approx S$ [if and only if]{}  ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}{\cong}{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} $ for some sufficiently large common extension $\lambda $ of their respective residue fields."
It follows easily from this that $\approx$ is an equivalence relation.
The collection of all local rings similar to a given Noetherian local ring $R$ is called the *similarity class* of $R$ and is denoted $[R]$.
"Immediately from the results in [@Mats §23] and [@SchCI Proposition 9.3] (where the notion of a *singularity defect* is introduced), we get:

\[T:transsim\] If two Noetherian local rings are similar, then they have the same dimension, depth and Hilbert series, and one is regular (respectively, [Cohen-Macaulay]{}, Gorenstein, complete intersection) [if and only if]{} the other is."
"More generally, any two similar local rings have the same singularity defects."
"Using Corollary \[C:scalreg\], other properties, such as being reduced or normal, are also invariant under the similarity relation, provided the rings are excellent with perfect residue field."
"Note that being a domain is not preserved under the similarity relation, necessitating definitions \[D:irr\]."
"\[P:ulsepsim\] Any two cpowers of a Noetherian local ring, or more generally, any two Noetherian local rings which are elementary equivalent, are similar."
"More generally, let ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ and ${S\mathstrut_{w}}$ be sequences of Noetherian local rings of embedding dimension at most $d$."
"If almost each ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is similar to ${S\mathstrut_{w}}$, then the respective cproducts ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ and ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}$ are also similar."
Suppose $R$ and $S$ are elementary equivalent Noetherian local rings.
"By the Keisler-Shelah theorem (see [@Hod Theorem 9.5.7]), some ultrapower of $R$ and $S$ are isomorphic, whence so are their corresponding cpowers (strictly speaking, the underlying index set will in general no longer be countable, so that we have to make some minor modifications alluded to in footnote ; details are left to the reader)."
"By Proposition \[P:ulsepsc\], these are scalar extensions of $R$ and $S$ respectively, proving the first assertion."
"To prove the second assertion, we may without loss of generality assume that all rings are complete."
"By our discussion above, we may further reduce to the case that ${S\mathstrut_{w}}$ is a scalar extension of ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$."
"Since ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is a homomorphic image of a $d$-dimensional regular local ring by Cohen’s structure theorems, and since the property we seek to prove is preserved under homomorphic images by Lemma \[L:ulsepbc\] and Corollary \[C:scal\], we may moreover assume by Corollary \[C:liftscal\] that each ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is regular, of dimension $d$."
"By Theorem \[T:transsim\], almost all ${S\mathstrut_{w}}$ are then also regular of dimension $d$."
"By [@SchFinEmb Corollary 5.15], the cproducts ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ and ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}$ are therefore again $d$-dimensional regular local rings."
"The induced [homomorphism]{} ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}\to
{S\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is unramified by Lemma \[L:ulsepbc\]."
"Hence, it is faithfully flat by [@Mats Theorem 23.1], whence a scalar extension, as we wanted to show."
We denote the collection of all similarity classes of Noetherian local rings by ${\mathbb{Sim}}$.
"Although the class of Noetherian local rings is not a set, we do no longer have this complication for its quotient:

\[P:set\] The quotient ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ is a set."
Let $[R]$ be a similarity class and let $\kappa$ be the residue field of $R$.
"Since $R\approx
{\widehat {R}}$, we may assume that $R$ is complete, whence, by Cohen’s structure theorems, the homomorphic image of $S:={V[[X]]}$ with $V$ either equal to $\kappa$ or to the complete $p$-ring over $\kappa$, and with $X$ a finite tuple of indeterminates."
"Suppose $R=S/I$ with $I={(f_1,\dots,f_{s})}S$."
We may choose a subring $W$ of $V$ of size at most the continuum so that it contains all coefficients of the $f_i$ and so that $W$ is again a field or a complete $p$-ring.
"Let $T:={W[[X]]}$ and $J:={(f_1,\dots,f_{s})}T$, so that $S{\cong}{{\widehat {T}}^{\kappa}}$ and $I=JS$."
"Hence, by base change, $R{\cong}S/I$ is a scalar extension of $T/J$, showing that $T/J\approx R$."
"In conclusion, we showed that every similarity class contains a ring of size at most the continuum, and therefore ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ is a set."
"[Jet]{} metric
==============

Our next goal is to define a metric on the space ${\mathbb{Sim}}$."
We will first define a semi-metric on the space of all Noetherian local rings.
"[Jet]{} semi-metric {#jetsemi-metric .unnumbered}
-------------------

Let $(R,{\mathfrak m})$ be a Noetherian local ring."
The *$n$-th [[jet]{}]{}* of $R$ (also called the *$n$-th infinitesimal neighborhood*) is by definition the (Artinian) residue ring $R/{\mathfrak m}^n$ and will be denoted ${J^{n}R}$.
"Recall that the (${\mathfrak m}$-adic) completion ${\widehat {R}}$ of $R$ is the inverse limit of all $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} of $R$, and that ${J^{n}R}{\cong}{J^{n}{\widehat {R}}}$."
"We define a semi-metric on the class of all Noetherian local rings, called the *[jet]{} metric*, as follows."
"Given two Noetherian local rings $R$ and $S$, let $d(R,S)$ be the infimum of the numbers $2^{-n}$ for which ${J^{n}R}{\cong}{J^{n}S}$."
"In words, the distance between two local rings is at most $2^{-n}$ if their $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} agree."
"One easily verifies that this distance function satisfies all the axioms of a metric, except that two distinct elements can be at distance zero, so that $ d(\cdot,\cdot)$ is only a semi-metric."
It is an interesting problem to determine all local rings that are $d$-equivalent to a given local ring; a partial answer is provided in [@vdDComp].
It is clear that any two Noetherian local rings with the same completion have this property.
"For our purposes, the following partial solution to this question suffices:

\[P:distzero\] Given two Noetherian local rings $R$ and $S$, if $R\sim_dS$, that is to say, if $
d(R,S)=0$, then $R\approx S$."
"By definition, there exists for each $n$ an Artinian local ring ${T\mathstrut_{n}}$ isomorphic to both ${J^{n}R}$ and ${J^{n}S}$."
"Let ${R\mathstrut_\natural}$ and ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ be the respective ultrapower and cpower of $R$, and let ${T\mathstrut_\natural}$ and ${T\mathstrut_\sharp}$ be the respective ultraproduct and cproduct of the ${T\mathstrut_{n}}$."
Taking ultraproducts of the surjections $R\to {T\mathstrut_{n}}$ yields a surjection ${R\mathstrut_\natural}\to{T\mathstrut_\natural}$ whence a surjection ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}\to{T\mathstrut_\sharp}$.
"Let $r\in{R\mathstrut_\natural}$ be an element whose image in ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ lies in the kernel of ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}\to{T\mathstrut_\sharp}$, that is to say, $r\in{{\operatorname}{Inf}({T\mathstrut_\natural})}$."
Let ${r\mathstrut_{n}}$ be elements in $R$ with ultraproduct equal to $r$.
Fix some $N$.
"Since $r\in{\mathfrak m}^N{T\mathstrut_\natural}$, [Łos’ Theorem]{} yields ${r\mathstrut_{n}}\in{\mathfrak m}^NT_n$ for almost all $n$."
"For $n\geq
N$, this implies ${r\mathstrut_{n}}\in{\mathfrak m}^N$ and hence by [Łos’ Theorem]{}, $r\in{\mathfrak m}^N{R\mathstrut_\natural}$."
"Since this holds for all $N$, the image of $r$ in ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is zero, showing that ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}\to{T\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is an isomorphism."
"Applying the same argument to the cpower ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}$ of $S$, we also get ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}{\cong}{T\mathstrut_\sharp}$ and hence ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}{\cong}{S\mathstrut_\sharp}$."
"Therefore, $R\approx S$ by Proposition \[P:ulsepsc\]."
"The [jet]{} semi-metric is non-archimedean, and hence the induced topology, called the *[jet]{}topology*, is totally disconnected."
"By convention, the zero-th [[jet]{}]{} of a ring is zero (since we think of ${\mathfrak m}^0$ as the unit ideal)."
"It follows that the distance between any two local rings is at most one, that is to say, $d$ is bounded."
"Immediately from the definitions we also get:

\[L:embdim\] If $ d(R,S)<1$, then $R$ and $S$ have the same residue field; if $ 
d(R,S)<1/2$, then $R$ and $S$ have the same embedding dimension."
"In particular, if, in this metric, ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is a Cauchy sequence of Noetherian local rings, then almost of all ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ have the same residue field, called the *residue field* of the sequence, and the same embedding dimension."
"By the above discussion, the cproduct ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is therefore a complete Noetherian local ring."
"By Lemma \[L:embdim\], the embedding dimension is a continuous map onto the discrete space ${\mathbb Z}$."
"This is no longer true for dimension: for instance $R:={k[[X]]}$ and $R_n:=R/X^nR$ lie at distance $2^{-n}$, yet their dimensions are not the same."
"One can show, however, that dimension is upper-semicontinuous."
"By an (open) *ball* ${\mathbb B}$ with *center* $R$ and *radius* $0< \delta\leq 1$, we mean the collection of all Noetherian local rings $S$ such that $  d(R,S)<\delta$."
"Since the metric is non-archimedean, any member of a ball is its center and every ball is both open and closed in the [jet]{}topology, that is to say, is a *clopen*."
"Because the distance function only takes discrete values (the powers of $1/2$), any two radii which lie between two consecutive powers of $1/2$ yield the same ball."
"Therefore, by the *radius* of a ball ${\mathbb B}$, we mean twice the largest distance between two members of ${\mathbb B}$; this is always a power of $1/2$."
(We need to take twice the distance since we used a strict inequality in the definition of a ball.)
A *unit ball* is a ball ${\mathbb B}$ with radius $1$ and hence consists of all local rings with the same residue field.
We call this common residue field the *residue field* of ${\mathbb B}$.
This gives a one-one correspondence between unit balls and fields.
"More generally, to every ball ${\mathbb B}$, we associate an Artinian local ring $R_{{\mathbb B}}$, called the *residue ring* of ${\mathbb B}$, given as the unique local ring such that ${J^{n}R}{\cong}R_{{\mathbb B}}$, for all $R\in{\mathbb B}$, where $2^{-n+1}$ is the radius of ${\mathbb B}$."
"Note that $R_{\mathbb B}$ is a center of ${\mathbb B}$ and, moreover, the radius of ${\mathbb B}$ is determined by $R_{{\mathbb B}}$: it is equal to $2^{-n+1}$ where $n$ is the nilpotency index of $R_{{\mathbb B}}$."
"In conclusion, there is a one-one correspondence between balls ${\mathbb B}$ and Artinian local rings."
\[P:card\] Every ball is a set.
It suffices to prove this for a unit ball ${\mathbb B}$.
The result will follow if we can show that there is a cardinal number so that every member of ${\mathbb B}$ has size at most this cardinal.
Let $\kappa$ be the residue field of ${\mathbb B}$ and let $R\in{\mathbb B}$.
"Since the cardinality of a Noetherian local ring is at most the cardinality of its completion, we may assume that $R$ is complete."
"By Cohen’s structure theorems, $R$ is a homomorphic image of ${V[[X]]}$, where $X$ is a finite tuple of indeterminates and $V$ is equal to $\kappa $ in the equal [characteristic]{} case, and equal to the complete $p$-ring over $\kappa $ in the mixed [characteristic]{} case."
"It is clear that in either case, the cardinality of ${V[[X]]}$ is bounded in terms of the cardinality of $\kappa$, whence so is its homomorphic image $R$."
"Note that each ball ${\mathbb B}$ is infinite: if $R_{\mathbb B}$ is its residue ring, then the latter is of the form $S/I$, where $(S,\mathfrak n)$ is a power series ring ${V[[X]]}$."
"If $n$ is the nilpotency index of $R_{\mathbb B}$, then $S/J\in{\mathbb B}$ for any ideal $J\sub S$ such that $J+\mathfrak n^n=I$."
"\[C:isomball\] Let $\kappa\subseteq \lambda $ be an extension of fields and let ${\mathbb B}_\kappa$ and ${\mathbb B}_\lambda$ be the unique unit balls with residue field $\kappa$ and $\lambda $, respectively."
The map sending a ring in ${\mathbb B}_\kappa$ to its completion along $\lambda $ is an isometry ${\mathbb B}_\kappa\to{\mathbb B}_\lambda$.
"Take $R,S\in{\mathbb B}_\kappa$."
"Clearly, the completions ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ and ${{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} $ along $\lambda $ belong both to ${\mathbb B}_ \lambda $."
"Suppose $  d(R,S)\leq 2^{-n}$, that is to say, their $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} ${J^{n}R}$ and ${J^{n}S}$ are isomorphic."
"By Corollary \[C:scal\], the completions of ${J^{n}R}$ and ${J^{n}S}$ along $\lambda $ are respectively ${J^{n}{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}}$ and ${J^{n}{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}}}$, and therefore are isomorphic, showing that $  d({{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}},{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}})\leq 2^{-n}$."
"\[P:lim\] If $\mathbf r$ and $\mathbf s$ are Cauchy sequences of Noetherian local rings, say, ${\mathbf{r}}(w):={R\mathstrut_{w}}$ and ${\mathbf{s}}(w):={S\mathstrut_{w}}$, with respective cproducts ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ and ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}$, then $ 
d({R\mathstrut_\sharp},{S\mathstrut_\sharp})\leq  d(\mathbf r,\mathbf s)$."
"In particular, if $\mathbf r\sim_d\mathbf s$, then ${R\mathstrut_\sharp} \approx
{S\mathstrut_\sharp} $."
The last assertion is immediate by the first and Proposition \[P:distzero\].
"Suppose $  d(\mathbf r,\mathbf s)\leq 2^{-n}$."
"This means that for some $w_0$ and all $w>w_0$, we have ${J^{n}{R\mathstrut_{w}}}{\cong}{J^{n}{S\mathstrut_{w}}}$."
"By Lemma \[L:ulsepbc\], the $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} ${J^{n}{R\mathstrut_\sharp}}$ and ${J^{n}{S\mathstrut_\sharp}}$ are isomorphic, showing that $  d({R\mathstrut_\sharp},{S\mathstrut_\sharp})\leq 2^{-n}$."
The next result shows that cproducts act as limits up to similarity.
"To formulate it, we extend our previous notation: let $\mathbf
r$ be a sequence of Noetherian local rings with the same residue field $\kappa$ (e.g., a Cauchy sequence) and let $\lambda $ be an extension field of $\kappa$."
"Then we let ${{\widehat {\mathbf r}}^{\lambda}} $ denote the sequence of rings obtained by taking the completions along $\lambda $ of all members of $\mathbf r$, that is to say, ${{\widehat {\mathbf r}}^{\lambda}}(w):={{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_{w}}}}^{\lambda}} $, if ${\mathbf{r}}(w)={R\mathstrut_{w}}$."
\[T:lim\] Let $\mathbf r$ be a Cauchy sequence of Noetherian local rings with residue field $\kappa$.
Let $\lambda $ be any extension field of the ultrapower ${\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}$ of $\kappa$.
Then ${{\widehat {\mathbf r}}^{\lambda}} $ is a Cauchy sequence converging to ${{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_\sharp}}}^{\lambda}} $.
"In particular, ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is a limit of ${{\widehat {\mathbf r}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}}$."
Let ${R\mathstrut_{w}}:={\mathbf{r}}(w)$.
"Fix $n$ and choose $w(n)$ so that all ${J^{n}{R\mathstrut_{w}}}$ for $w\geq w(n)$ are isomorphic, say, to $T$."
"By Lemma \[L:ulsepbc\], the $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}${J^{n}{R\mathstrut_\sharp}}$ is isomorphic to the cpower ${T\mathstrut_\sharp}$; the latter is isomorphic to ${{\widehat {T}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}}$ by Corollary \[C:ulsepscal\]; and this in turn is isomorphic to ${J^{n}\big({{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_{w}}}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}} \big)}$, for all $w\geq w(n)$ by Corollary \[C:scal\]."
"In summary, we showed that $$d({{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_{w}}}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}},{R\mathstrut_\sharp})\leq
2^{-n},$$ for all $w\geq w(n)$."
"By Corollary \[C:isomball\], taking completions along $\lambda $ yields $  d({{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_{w}}}}^{\lambda}},{{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_\sharp}}}^{\lambda}})\leq 2^{-n}$, for all $w\geq w(n)$."
"Since this holds for all $n$, the assertion follows."
"Similarity space
================

We are ready to define a metric on the similarity space ${\mathbb{Sim}}$."
"For two similarity classes $[R]$ and $[S]$, let $  d([R],[S])$ be equal to the infimum of all $ 
d(R',S')$ with $R'\approx R$ and $S'\approx S$."
"Alternatively, recall that for a semi-metric space $(\Sigma,d)$, the distance $  d(U,V)$ between two subclasses $U$ and $V$ is defined to be the infimum of all $  d(x,y)$ with $x\in U$ and $y\in V$; hence $ 
d([R],[S])$ is just the distance between $[R]$ and $[S]$ viewed as subclasses."
"\[L:app\] For any two Noetherian local rings $R$ and $S$ and for any $n\in{\mathbb N}$, we have $  d([R],[S])\leq 2^{-n}$ [if and only if]{} ${J^{n}R}\approx {J^{n}S}$."
"Suppose $  d([R],[S])\leq 2^{-n}$ and choose $R'\approx R$ and $S'\approx S$ so that $  d(R',S')\leq 2^{-n}$."
"In other words, ${J^{n}R'}{\cong}{J^{n}S'}$ and therefore, ${J^{n}R}\approx {J^{n}S}$ by Corollary \[C:scal\]."
"Conversely, assume ${J^{n}R}\approx
{J^{n}S}$ and let $T$ be a common scalar extension of ${J^{n}R}$ and ${J^{n}S}$."
Let $\lambda $ be the residue field of $T$.
"By Corollary \[C:scal\], the $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} of ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ and ${{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} $ are equal to $T$."
"In other words, $ 
d({{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}},{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}})\leq 2^{-n}$."
"Since $  d([R],[S])$ is defined as an infimum, it is at most $2^{-n}$."
"\[C:metric\] The quotient $({\mathbb{Sim}}, d)$ is a metric space."
"Suppose $  d([R],[S])=0$."
"By Lemma \[L:app\], the $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} ${J^{n}R}$ and ${J^{n}S}$ of $R$ and $S$ are similar for all $n$."
Hence there exists a common scalar extension $T_n$ of ${J^{n}R}$ and ${J^{n}S}$.
"We may inductively choose $T_{n+1}$ to have a residue field containing the residue field of $T_n$ by Corollary \[C:isomball\], since scalar extensions can only make the distance smaller."
Let $\lambda $ be the union of all these residue fields.
"By Corollary \[C:scal\], the $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} of ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}} $ and ${{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} $ are equal to ${{\widehat {T_n}}^{\lambda}} $."
"Since this holds for all $n$, we showed that $  d({{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}},{{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}})=0$."
"By Proposition \[P:distzero\], we get ${{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}\approx {{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}} $ and hence $[R]=[{{\widehat {R}}^{\lambda}}]=[ {{\widehat {S}}^{\lambda}}]=[S]$."
"It follows from Theorem \[T:lim\] that given a Cauchy sequence $\mathbf r$ of Noetherian local rings, the sequence ${{\widehat {\mathbf r}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}}$ has a limit, where ${\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}$ is the ultrapower of the residue field of $\mathbf r$."
"Since the corresponding members of $\mathbf r$ and ${{\widehat {\mathbf r}}^{{\kappa\mathstrut_\natural}}}$ are similar, we showed that every Cauchy sequence becomes convergent after replacing each of its components by an appropriately chosen similar ring."
"Therefore, the next result should not come as a surprise:

\[T:simcomp\] The metric space ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ is complete."
"We will define an isometry ${\widehat {\imath}}\colon {\widehat {{\mathbb{Sim}}}}\to
{\mathbb{Sim}}$ as follows."
"We start with defining a map $i\colon {{\operatorname}{Cau}({\mathbb{Sim}})} \to
{\mathbb{Sim}}$."
Let ${\mathbf r}$ be a Cauchy sequence in ${\mathbb{Sim}}$.
"For each $w$, let ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ be a representative in the similarity class ${\mathbf{r}}(w)$, and let ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ be their cproduct."
Note that ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ is a complete Noetherian local ring since almost all ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ have the same embedding dimension.
Define $i({\mathbf r}):=[{R\mathstrut_\sharp}]$.
"By Proposition \[P:ulsepsim\], the map $i$ is well-defined, that is to say, does not depend on the choice of representatives ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$."
Suppose ${\mathbf s}$ is a second Cauchy sequence which is equivalent to ${\mathbf r}$ and let ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}$ be the cproduct of the representatives ${S\mathstrut_{w}}$ of each ${\mathbf{s}}(w)$.
"For a fixed $n$, we have $  d([{R\mathstrut_{w}}],[{S\mathstrut_{w}}])\leq 2^{-n}$ for all sufficiently large $w$."
"By Lemma \[L:app\], the $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} of ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ and ${S\mathstrut_{w}}$ are therefore similar, for all sufficiently large $w$."
"By Proposition \[P:ulsepsim\], then so are the $n$-th [[jet]{}]{}[s]{} of ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ and ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}$, so that $  d([{R\mathstrut_\sharp}],[{S\mathstrut_\sharp}])\leq 2^{-n}$ by another application of Lemma \[L:app\]."
"Since this holds for all $n$, Corollary \[C:metric\] yields $[{R\mathstrut_\sharp}]=[{S\mathstrut_\sharp}]$."
"By definition of completion, $i$ therefore factors through a map $${\widehat {\imath}}\colon {\widehat {{\mathbb{Sim}}}}\to {\mathbb{Sim}}.$$ We leave it to the reader to check that ${\widehat {\imath}}$ preserves the metric."
"Note that ${\widehat {\imath}}$ restricted to ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ is the identity, since a cpower is a scalar extension by Proposition \[P:ulsepsim\]."
Hence ${\widehat {\imath}}$ must be surjective.
"To prove injectivity, assume $\mathbf r$ and $\mathbf s$ are Cauchy sequences of Noetherian local rings whose respective cproducts ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ and ${S\mathstrut_\sharp}$ are similar."
"Let $\lambda $ be a large enough field extension so that $${{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_\sharp}}}^{\lambda}}{\cong}{{\widehat {{S\mathstrut_\sharp}}}^{\lambda}}.$$ By Theorem \[T:lim\], the (component-wise) completion ${{\widehat {{\mathbf{r}}}}^{\lambda}} $ along $\lambda $ converges to ${{\widehat {{R\mathstrut_\sharp}}}^{\lambda}} $, and likewise ${{\widehat {\mathbf s}}^{\lambda}} $ converges to ${{\widehat {{S\mathstrut_\sharp}}}^{\lambda}} $."
"Therefore, ${{\widehat {\mathbf
r}}^{\lambda}} $ and ${{\widehat {\mathbf s}}^{\lambda}} $, as they converge to the same limit, are equivalent, which proves that ${\widehat {\imath}}$ is injective."
We have the following generalization of Proposition \[P:ulsepsim\].
"If ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is a Cauchy sequence, then any two cataproducts of ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ (with respect to different ultrafilters) are similar."
"In particular, if the common residue field $\kappa$ of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is an [algebraically closed field]{}, then the cataproduct of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is, up to isomorphism, independent from the choice of ultrafilter."
"According to the proof of Theorem \[T:simcomp\], the similarity class of any cataproduct ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is a limit of the sequence of similarity classes $[{R\mathstrut_{w}}]$, and therefore, is unique by Corollary \[C:metric\]."
"Since any two ultrapowers of $\kappa$ are algebraically closed and have the same (uncountable) cardinality, they are isomorphic by Leibnitz’s theorem."
"Since any two cataproducts of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ are similar by the first assertion, and are complete with isomorphic residue fields, they must be isomorphic by Proposition \[P:compscal\]."
We introduce the following notation.
"Let $\mathbb S\sub {\mathbb{Sim}}$ be a subset, and let $d\geq 0$ and $e\geq 1$."
"We let $\mathbb S_d$ (respectively, $\mathbb S_{d,e}$) be the set of similarity classes of Noetherian local rings in $\mathbb S$ having dimension $d$ (and parameter degree $e$)."
"Recall that the *parameter degree* of $R$ is the minimal length of a residue ring $R/I$, where $I$ runs over all parameter ideals of $R$."
"It is not hard to show that two similar rings with infinite residue field have the same parameter degree, and so we may speak of the parameter degree of a similarity class as the parameter degree of any of its members having infinite residue field."
"For each $d\geq 0$ and $e\geq 1$, the subset ${\mathbb{Sim}}_{d,e}\sub{\mathbb{Sim}}$ is closed."
"It suffices to show that ${\mathbb{Sim}}_{d,e}$ is closed under limits."
"Hence let ${\mathbf{r}}$ be a Cauchy sequence in ${\mathbb{Sim}}_{d,e}$, and choose representatives ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ in each ${\mathbf{r}}(w)$, of dimension $d$ and parameter degree $e$."
"Let ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ be the cataproduct of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$, so that its similarity class is the limit of ${\mathbf{r}}$ by Theorem \[T:simcomp\]."
"Since the cataproduct ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ has dimension $d$ and parameter degree $e$ by [@SchFinEmb Theorem 5.22], the claim follows."
"We can now state and prove the main theorem of this paper:

\[T:smooth\] The metric space ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ is a Polish space."
"In particular, the similarity relation is smooth."
"In view of Theorem \[T:simcomp\], it remains to show that ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ contains a countable dense subset."
"We already observed that there is a one-one correspondence between balls and Artinian local rings, so that ${\mathbb{Sim}}_0$, the similarity classes of Artinian local rings, form a dense subset of ${\mathbb{Sim}}$."
Let $R$ be an Artinian local ring with residue field $\kappa$.
"By Cohen’s structure theorems, $R$ is of the form ${V[[X]]}/I$, where $V$ is either $\kappa $ or the complete $p$-ring over $\kappa $, and where $X$ is a tuple of indeterminates."
"Since $R$ is Artinian, it is in fact finitely generated over $V$."
"Hence, by an argument similar to the one in the proof of Proposition \[P:set\], there exists a finitely generated subfield $\kappa_0\sub \kappa$ and an Artinian local ring $R_0$ with residue field $\kappa_0$, such that $R_0\approx R$."
"Since there are only countably many finitely generated fields, the collection of all these $R_0$ is again countable."
"Variants
========

A first variant is simply obtained by working in the category of all Noetherian local $Z$-algebras, for $Z$ some Noetherian ring, so that the morphisms are now given by local $Z$-algebra [homomorphism]{}[s]{}."
"This leads to the notion of two $Z$-algebras being *$Z$-similar*, and the same argument shows that classifying Noetherian local $Z$-algebras up to $Z$-similarity is again a smooth problem."
We may also extend the definition to include modules.
"Namely, given an $R$-module $M$ and an $S$-module $N$, we say that $d(M,N)\leq 2^{-n}$, if ${J^{n}R}$ and ${J^{n}S}$ have a common scalar extension $T$ such that $M{\otimes}_RT{\cong}N{\otimes}_ST$."
"In particular, $d(R,S)\leq d(M,N)$."
"We will not study the similarity problem for modules—and at present, I do not know whether this is a smooth classification problem, even over a fixed ring."
We will use this metric in the proof of Theorem \[T:Poinc\]; see also [@SchFinEmb §11] for some further applications.
We now turn to some other classification problems that can be reduced to the classification up to similarity.
"Classification of analytic germs {#classification-of-analytic-germs .unnumbered}
--------------------------------

Let $\kappa $ be a field."
"By an *analytic germ* over $\kappa $, we mean a complete Noetherian local ring with residue field $\kappa $; we denote the set of isomorphism classes of analytic germs by ${\mathbb{SimAn}}(\kappa)$."
"Note that if $\kappa $ has prime [characteristic]{} $p$, then the germ can either have equal or mixed [characteristic]{}."
"By the Cohen structure theorem, analytic germs are simply homomorphic images of power series rings ${V[[X]]}$, with $V$ either $\kappa $ (equal [characteristic]{}) or the complete $p$-ring over $\kappa $ (mixed [characteristic]{})."
"Assume, moreover, that $\kappa $ is algebraically closed and has size of the continuum."
"It follows that every (countable) ultrapower ${\kappa\mathstrut_\natural} $ of $\kappa $ is again algebraically closed and has the same cardinality as $\kappa $, whence by Leibniz’s theorem, is isomorphic with $\kappa $."
"In the mixed [characteristic]{} case, by uniqueness of $p$-rings, the catapower of $V$ is then also isomorphic to $V$."
"This shows that the set of analytic germs over such a field $\kappa $ is, up to isomorphism, closed under cataproducts, whence under limits."
"Moreover, there are, up to isomorphism, only countably many analytic germs of dimension zero, and they form a dense subset ${\mathbb{SimAn}}_0(\kappa)$ of ${\mathbb{SimAn}}(\kappa)$."
"In conclusion, we showed Theorem \[T:formgerm\] from the introduction."
"Note that in the above, we may replace the size of the continuum by any cardinal of the form $2^\gamma$, with $\gamma$ an infinite cardinal."
"Moreover, under the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, this means any uncountable cardinal."
"Infinitesimal deformations {#infinitesimal-deformations .unnumbered}
--------------------------

By a *[deformator]{}* ${\mathbf{R}}$, we mean a pair $(R,{\mathbf{x}})$, with $(R,{\mathfrak m})$ a Noetherian local ring and ${\mathbf{x}}:={(x_1,\dots,x_{d})}$ a tuple generating an ${\mathfrak m}$-primary ideal."
"To emphasize the maximal ideal, we may also represent the [deformator]{} ${\mathbf{R}}$ as the triple $(R,{\mathfrak m},{\mathbf{x}})$."
"We call $R$ and ${\mathbf{x}}$ respectively the *underlying ring* and *tuple* of ${\mathbf{R}}$, and we call the length of $R/{\mathbf{x}}R$ the *colength* of ${\mathbf{R}}$."
"We call ${\mathbf{R}}$ *parametric*, if ${\mathbf{x}}$ is a system of parameters."
"When we say that a [deformator]{} has a certain ring theoretic property, then we mean that its underlying ring has this property."
"Let ${\mathbf{S}}:=(S,{\mathbf{y}})$ be a second [deformator]{}, with ${\mathbf{y}}={(y_1,\dots,y_{e})}$."
"A *morphism ${\mathbf{R}}\to {\mathbf{S}}$ of [deformator]{}s*, is a ring [homomorphism]{} $R\to S$ mapping ${\mathbf{x}}$ to ${\mathbf{y}}$."
"In particular, there are no morphisms between [deformator]{}[s]{} with tuples of different length."
It is easy to verify that these definitions make the class of [deformator]{}[s]{} into a category.
"We call a morphism ${\mathbf{R}}\to {\mathbf{S}}$ *flat, unramified, a scalar extension, etc."
"*, [if and only if]{} the underlying [homomorphism]{} $R\to S$ has this property."
"We say that ${\mathbf{R}}$ and ${\mathbf{S}}$ are *similar*, in symbols, ${\mathbf{R}}\approx{\mathbf{S}}$, if they have a common scalar extension ${\mathbf{T}}$ (as [deformator]{}[s]{})."
"As before, we denote the similarity class of a [deformator]{} ${\mathbf{R}}$ by $[{\mathbf{R}}]$."
"The *$n$-th infinitesimal deformation* of a [deformator]{} ${\mathbf{R}}:=(R,{\mathbf{x}})$, denoted ${J^{n}{\mathbf{R}}}$, is by definition the Artinian [deformator]{} $(R/{{\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}}R,{\mathbf{x}})$, where for an arbitrary tuple ${\mathbf{y}}:={(y_1,\dots,y_{s})}$, we write ${{\mathbf{y}}^{(n)}}$ for the tuple $(y_1^n,\dots,y_s^n)$."
"If ${\mathbf{R}}\to {\mathbf{S}}$ is a morphism of [deformator]{}[s]{}, then it induces, for each $n$, a morphism ${J^{n}{\mathbf{R}}}\to {J^{n}{\mathbf{S}}}$."
"\[L:defpairscal\] If ${\mathbf{R}}$ and ${\mathbf{S}}$ are similar [deformator]{}s, then ${J^{n}{\mathbf{R}}}\approx{J^{n}{\mathbf{S}}}$, for all $n$."
"Since the respective underlying rings $R$ and $S$ are similar, they have the same dimension."
"Without loss of generality, we may assume that ${\mathbf{R}}\to {\mathbf{S}}$ is a scalar extension."
"By definition of morphism, under the scalar extension $R\to S$, the tuple of ${\mathbf{R}}$ is sent to that of ${\mathbf{S}}$, and the assertion is now clear."
Let ${\mathbb{SimDef}}$ denote the set of similarity classes of [deformator]{}[s]{} (the argument that this is indeed a set is analoguos to the one for ${\mathbb{Sim}}$).
"We define the *deformation metric* on ${\mathbb{SimDef}}$ in analogy with the [jet]{} metric: given two similarity classes of [deformator]{}[s]{} $[{\mathbf{R}}:=(R,{\mathbf{x}})]$ and $[{\mathbf{S}}:=(S,{\mathbf{y}})]$, we set $d([{\mathbf{R}}],[{\mathbf{S}}])\leq 2^{-n}$, if ${J^{n}{\mathbf{R}}}\approx{J^{n}{\mathbf{S}}}$."
"By Lemmas \[L:app\] and \[L:defpairscal\], this definition is independent from the choice of representatives."
"Moreover, if ${J^{n}{\mathbf{R}}}\approx{J^{n}{\mathbf{S}}}$, then the definition of morphisms in the category of [deformator]{}[s]{} implies that ${J^{i}{\mathbf{R}}}\approx{J^{i}{\mathbf{S}}}$, for all $i\leq n$."
"Indeed, we may reduce to the case that we have a scalar extension ${J^{n}{\mathbf{R}}}\to{J^{n}{\mathbf{S}}}$, which therefore maps ${\mathbf{x}}$ to ${\mathbf{y}}$, and the claim is now clear."
"If $d({\mathbf{R}},{\mathbf{S}})<1$, then ${\mathbf{R}}$ and ${\mathbf{S}}$ have in particular the same colength."
"As with rings, we will often indentify a similarity class with any [deformator]{} contained in it, and so we will omit brackets in our notation and speak of the distance between [deformator]{}[s]{}."
"The connection between the [jet]{} metric and the deformational metric is given by:

\[P:metcomp\] If ${\mathbf{R}}$ and ${\mathbf{S}}$ are [deformator]{}[s]{} with respective underlying rings $R$ and $S$, then $d(R,S)\leq d({\mathbf{R}},{\mathbf{S}})$."
"Conversely, for every [deformator]{} ${\mathbf{R}}$, if $T$ is a Noetherian local ring at distance $\varepsilon$ from $R$, then we can find a [deformator]{} ${\mathbf{T}}$ with underlying ring $T$, such that $d({\mathbf{R}},{\mathbf{T}})\leq\varepsilon^{1/{(lm+1)}}$, where $l$ is the colength of ${\mathbf{R}}$ and $m$ the length of its tuple."
"If, moreover, ${\mathbf{R}}$ is parametric, and ${\operatorname}{dim}(R)={\operatorname}{dim}(T)$, then we may also choose ${\mathbf{T}}$ to be parametric."
"Let $(R,{\mathfrak m})$ and $(S,\mathfrak n)$ be the respective underlying rings of ${\mathbf{R}}$ and ${\mathbf{S}}$, and let ${\mathbf{x}}$ and ${\mathbf{y}}$ be their respective tuples."
"If ${J^{k}{\mathbf{R}}}\approx{J^{k}{\mathbf{S}}}$, for some $k$, then clearly ${J^{k}R}\approx{J^{k}S}$, since ${{\mathbf{x}}^{(k)}}R\sub{\mathfrak m}^k$ and ${{\mathbf{y}}^{(k)}}S\sub\mathfrak n^k$."
This proves the first assertion.
"To prove the second, observe that since ${\mathfrak m}^l\sub I:={\mathbf{x}}R$, we get $$\label{eq:sublmn}
{\mathfrak m}^{lmn}\sub I^{mn}\sub{{\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}} R,$$ for all $n$."
Hence $\bar R:=R/{{\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}}R$ is a homomorphic image of ${J^{lmn}R}$.
"Suppose $d(R,T)\leq 2^{-k}$, so that ${J^{k}R}\approx {J^{k}T}$."
"Without loss of generality, we may assume that ${J^{k}R}\to {J^{k}T}$ is a scalar extension."
"Let ${\mathbf{z}}$ be a lifting in $T$ of the image of ${\mathbf{x}}$ in ${J^{k}T}$ under this scalar extension, and put ${\mathbf{T}}:=(T,{\mathbf{z}})$."
"Let $n$ be an integer strictly less than $k/lm$, so that $lmn<k$."
"We want to show that ${\mathfrak p}^k\sub {{\mathbf{z}}^{(n)}}T$, where ${\mathfrak p}$ is the maximal ideal of $T$."
Put $\bar T:= T/{{\mathbf{z}}^{(n)}}T$.
The map ${J^{k}R}\to {J^{k}T}$ induces a scalar extension $\bar R\to \bar T/{\mathfrak p}^k\bar T$.
"By , the latter is annihilated by ${\mathfrak p}^{lmn}$."
"Hence ${\mathfrak p}^{lmn}\bar T={\mathfrak p}^k\bar T$, and since $lmn<k$, Nakayama’s Lemma yields ${\mathfrak p}^{lmn}\bar T=0$, and the claim follows."
"In particular, base change induces a scalar extension $\bar R\to \bar T$, and hence a scalar extension ${J^{n}{\mathbf{R}}}\to {J^{n}{\mathbf{T}}}$ of [deformator]{}[s]{}, showing that $d({\mathbf{R}},{\mathbf{T}})\leq 2^{-n}$, as we wanted to show."
"\[T:defsmooth\] Classification of [deformator]{}[s]{} up to similarity is smooth, or, more precisely, ${\mathbb{SimDef}}$ is a Polish space."
"Let ${{\mathbf{R}}\mathstrut_{w}}$ be a Cauchy sequence in ${\mathbb{SimDef}}$, and let ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ be the corresponding sequence of underlying rings."
"By Proposition \[P:metcomp\], this latter sequence is also Cauchy, whence has a limit in ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ by Theorem \[T:simcomp\]."
"In fact, we may take the cataproduct ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ as a representative of this limit."
"Since all tuples in ${{\mathbf{R}}\mathstrut_{w}}$ must have the same length, their ultraproduct yields a finite tuple in ${\mathbf{x}}$ in ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$."
"Moreover, almost all ${{\mathbf{R}}\mathstrut_{w}}$ have the same colength, which, by [Łos’ Theorem]{}, is then also the length of ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}/{\mathbf{x}}{R\mathstrut_\sharp}$."
"In particular, $({R\mathstrut_\sharp},{\mathbf{x}})$ is a [deformator]{}."
The second part of Proposition \[P:metcomp\] shows that it is the limit of the ${{\mathbf{R}}\mathstrut_{w}}$.
This proves that ${\mathbb{SimDef}}$ is complete.
Remains to show that the subset ${\mathbb{SimDef}}_0$ of Artinian [deformator]{}[s]{} is countable and dense.
"However, we argued in the proof of Theorem \[T:smooth\] that each similarity class of an Artinian local ring $R$ contains a representative $R_0$ with a finitely generated residue field."
"Given any (finite) tuple ${\mathbf{x}}$, we may choose $R_0$ so that it also contains ${\mathbf{x}}$."
"From this it is easy to see that ${\mathbb{SimDef}}_0$ is countable, and density is also immediate."
We denote the subset of similarity classes of parametric [deformator]{}[s]{} by ${\mathbb{SimPar}}$.
"Dimension, as this is equal to the length of the tuple, partitions this space in the pieces ${\mathbb{SimPar}}_d$."
It follows immediately from the above proof that each ${\mathbb{SimPar}}_d$ is a complete subspace of ${\mathbb{SimDef}}$.
"In particular, ${\mathbb{Sim}}_0$ is isometric with ${\mathbb{SimPar}}_0$."
"However, for $d>0$, it is no longer clear whether ${\mathbb{SimPar}}_d$ has a countable dense subset, and therefore, it might fail to be a Polish subspace."
"Classification of polarized schemes up to isomorphism {#classification-of-polarized-schemes-up-to-isomorphism .unnumbered}
-----------------------------------------------------

Our next application is to the classification of projective schemes."
We will tacitly assume that a *projective scheme* $X$ is always of finite type over some field $\kappa$.
"A *polarization* of $X$ is a choice of a very ample line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $X$; we refer to this situation also by calling $\mathfrak X:=(X,\mathcal L)$ a *polarized scheme over $\kappa$*, and we say that $X$ is the *underlying projective scheme* of $\mathfrak X$."
"In particular, a polarization $(X,\mathcal
L)$ corresponds to a closed immersion $i\colon X\to \mathbb P_\kappa^n$, for some $n$, such that $\mathcal L{\cong}i^*{{\mathcal {O}}}(1)$, where ${{\mathcal {O}}}(1)$ is the canonical twisting sheaf on $\mathbb P_\kappa^n$."
"The *section* ring of a polarized scheme $\mathfrak X:=(X,\mathcal L)$ is defined as the graded $\kappa$-algebra $$S(\mathfrak X):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty H^0(X,\mathcal L^n)$$ Note that, since $\mathcal L$ is very ample, $S(\mathfrak X)$ is a *standard graded $\kappa$-algebra*, meaning that it has no homogeneous components of negative degree, its degree zero component is $\kappa$, and, as an algebra over $\kappa$, it is generated by its homogeneous elements of degree one."
"The *vertex algebra* of $\mathfrak X$ is the localization of $S(\mathfrak
X)$ at the irrelevant ideal of all elements of positive degree, and will be denoted by ${\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak X)$."
"If $X$ is irreducible and reduced, then the field of fractions of $S(\mathfrak X)$ (and hence of ${\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak X)$) is equal to the function field $\kappa(X)$."
"In particular, ${\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak X)$ is a birational invariant of $X$."
"In fact, more is true: the polarized scheme $\mathfrak X:=(X,\mathcal L)$ can be recovered from its section ring $S:=S(\mathfrak X)$ as $X={\operatorname}{Proj}(S)$ and $\mathcal L=\widetilde{S(1)}$, where $S(1)$ is the *Serre twist* of $S$."
"We therefore say that two polarized schemes $\mathfrak X:=(X,\mathcal L)$ and $\mathfrak Y:=(Y,\mathcal M)$ are *isomorphic*, if their section rings are isomorphic as graded $\kappa$-algebras, and this is then equivalent with the existence of an isomorphism $f\colon X\to Y$ of projective schemes, such that $f^*\mathcal M=\mathcal L$."
Let $\mathbb{Pol}_\kappa$ be the set of isomorphism classes of polarized schemes over $\kappa$.
"We metrize this space via pull-back along the vertex functor, that is to say, $$d(\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y):=  d({\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak
X),{\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak Y)).$$ The following easy lemma allows us to calculate this distance function:

\[L:polapp\] Let $\mathfrak X:=(X,\mathcal L)$ be a polarized scheme over $\kappa$ with vertex algebra $R:={\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak X)$."
"For each $n$, we have an isomorphism of graded Artinian $\kappa$-algebras $${J^{n}R}{\cong}\bigoplus_{i=0}^{n-1} H^0(X,\mathcal L^i).$$

Let $S:=S(\mathfrak X)$ be the section ring of $\mathfrak X$, and let ${\mathfrak m}$ be the irrelevant maximal ideal."
"Since $R=S_{\mathfrak m}$, we have ${J^{n}R}=S/{\mathfrak m}^n$, for all $n$."
"Since $S$ is a standard graded algebra, ${\mathfrak m}^n$ consists of all elements of degree at least $n$, that is to say, $${\mathfrak m}^n=\bigoplus_{i\geq n} H^0(X,\mathcal L^i),$$ from which the assertion follows immediately."
"We can now show that we have indeed a metric on $\mathbb{Pol}_\kappa$:

If two polarized schemes $\mathfrak X$ and $\mathfrak Y$ over $\kappa$ are at distance zero, then they are isomorphic."
"By Lemma \[L:polapp\], their section rings are isomorphic, and we already argued that this means that the two polarized schemes are isomorphic."
"### Proof of Theorem \[T:pol\] {#proof-of-theoremtpol .unnumbered}

We will show that $\mathbb{Pol}_\kappa$ is a Polish space, and to this end, we need to show that it contains a countable dense subset and is closed under limits."
"By Lemma \[L:polapp\], the polarizations $(X,\mathcal L)$ of zero-dimensional projective schemes are dense."
"Any such scheme is the base change of a zero-dimensional projective scheme $X_0$ over a finitely generated field, and since very ample line bundles are generated by their global sections, we may choose $X_0$ so that it admits a very ample line bundle $\mathcal L_0$ which induces the line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $X$ by base change."
"This shows that, up to isomorphism, there are only countably many polarizations of zero-dimensional projective schemes."
"So remains to show that every Cauchy sequence ${\mathfrak X\mathstrut_{w}}:=({X\mathstrut_{w}},{\mathcal L\mathstrut_{w}})$ in $\mathbb{Pol}_\kappa$ has a limit."
"Let ${R\mathstrut_{w}}:={\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak X)$, so that by definition, ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is a Cauchy sequence of Noetherian local rings."
Let ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ be the cataproduct of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$.
"By the same argument as in the proof of Theorem \[T:formgerm\], our assumption on the field $\kappa$ implies that ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ has residue field isomorphic to $\kappa$."
"Let $R$ be an isomorphic copy of ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$ having residue field $\kappa$, and let $f\colon {R\mathstrut_\sharp}\to R$ be the corresponding isomorphism."
Fix some $n$.
"By Lemma \[L:polapp\], ${J^{n}R}{\cong}{J^{n}{R\mathstrut_{w}}}$, for all $w\gg 0$."
"In particular, the $n$-th homogeneous piece $S_n:=H^0({X\mathstrut_{w}},{\mathcal L\mathstrut_{w}}^n)$ is independent from $w$, for $w$ sufficiently large."
"Since $S_n$ has finite length, its ultrapower is equal to its catapower, and, therefore, via $f$, isomorphic to itself."
Let $S:=\oplus_nS_n$.
One verifies that this is a standard graded $\kappa$-algebra.
"For instance, to define the ring structure on $S$, it suffices to define the multiplication of two homogeneous elements, say $a\in S_i$ and $b\in S_j$."
"Take $w$ large enough so that $H^0({X\mathstrut_{w}},{\mathcal L\mathstrut_{w}}^{i+j})$ is equal to $S_{i+j}$."
"Choose ${a\mathstrut_{w}},{b\mathstrut_{w}}\in S({\mathfrak X\mathstrut_{w}})$ so that their images in ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ have ultraproducts ${a\mathstrut_\natural},{b\mathstrut_\natural}\in {R\mathstrut_\natural}$ with $f({a\mathstrut_\natural})=a$ and $f({b\mathstrut_\natural})=b$."
"By [Łos’ Theorem]{}, ${a\mathstrut_{w}}$ and ${b\mathstrut_{w}}$ are homogeneous of degree $i$ and $j$ respectively."
We then define $ab$ as the image under $f$ of the ultraproduct of the ${a\mathstrut_{w}}{b\mathstrut_{w}}\in S_{i+j}$.
The other properties are checked similarly.
"In particular, ${J^{n}R}{\cong}S_0\oplus\dots\oplus S_n$, showing that $R$ is the localization of $S$ at its irrelevant maximal ideal."
"Let $\mathfrak X:=(X,\mathcal L)$ be the polarized scheme determined by $S$, namely, $X:={\operatorname}{Proj}(S)$ and $\mathcal L:=\widetilde{S(1)}$."
"Remains to show that $\mathfrak X$ is the limit of the ${\mathfrak X\mathstrut_{w}}$, and this is immediate form the fact that ${\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak X)=R$."
"Prolegomena to a complete set of invariants: slopes
===================================================

Theorem \[T:smooth\], although promising, is far from an efficient classification up to similarity."
"In this final section, we will discuss some (albeit feable) attempts to make it more concrete."
"As mentioned in the introduction, any two (uncountable) Polish spaces are Borel equivalent, namely to the standard Borel space on the reals."
"So, given any (concrete) Polish space $\mathbb B$, we ask for a Borel bijection $q\colon {\mathbb{Sim}}\to\mathbb B$."
"Let us call a map $q\colon {\mathbb{Sim}}\to\mathbb B$ a *slope*, if it is continuous."
"Of course, the identity map into ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ itself is a slope, but we seek more concrete examples."
"A solution to the classification problem would, for instance, be provided by any real-valued, injective slope."
"Extending this terminology, let us say that for some subset $\mathbb S\sub {\mathbb{Sim}}$ and a map $q\colon  {\mathbb{Sim}}\to \mathbb B$, that $q$ is a *slope* on $\mathbb S$ when its restriction to $\mathbb S$ is continuous."
"A priori, the theory only predicts that we can find a real-valued, injective Borel map, which in general is only continuous outside a meagre subset, but perhaps we may venture to postulate the existence of a countable partition $\{\mathbb S_i\}$ of ${\mathbb{Sim}}$, and an injective map $q\colon{\mathbb{Sim}}\to \mathbb R$, such that $q$ restricted to each piece $\mathbb S_i$ is a slope."
"Moreover, we want this partition to be indexed by some natural discrete invariants that are preserved under the similarity relation, like dimension and/or parameter degree."
"We start with some examples of non-injective slopes taking values into a concrete complete topological space (from now on, we will confuse a similarity class with any of its members):

\[P:Hilb\] Viewing ${{\mathbb Z}[[t]]}$ in its $t$-adic metric, the map ${\operatorname}{Hilb}\colon{\mathbb{Sim}}\to
{{\mathbb Z}[[t]]}$ induced by associating to a Noetherian local ring its Hilbert series ${\operatorname}{Hilb}(R)$, is a slope."
"Recall that the *Hilbert series* of $(R,{\mathfrak m})$ is defined to be the formal power series $${\operatorname}{Hilb}(R):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \ell({\mathfrak m}^n/{\mathfrak m}^{n+1})t^n.$$ If $R$ and $S$ are similar, then they have the same Hilbert series, showing that ${\operatorname}{Hilb}$ is defined on ${\mathbb{Sim}}$."
"By an easy calculation, $\ell({\mathfrak m}^n/{\mathfrak m}^{n+1})=\ell({J^{n+1}R})-\ell({J^{n}R})$."
"Hence, if ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ converges to $R$, then for each $n$, we have ${J^{n}R}={J^{n}{R\mathstrut_{w}}}$, for all sufficiently large $w$, showing that ${\operatorname}{Hilb}$ is continuous."
"For a second example of a (non-injective) slope, we make the following definition."
"Let $R$ be a local ring with residue field $\kappa $, and let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module."
"The *$n$-th Betti number* $\beta_n(M)$ of $M$ is defined as the vector space dimension of ${\operatorname{Tor}^{R}_{n}(M,\kappa)} $."
"Alternatively, at least in the Noetherian case, the Betti numbers are the ranks in a minimal free resolution of $M$, and, hence by Nakayama’s Lemma, the minimal number of generators of the syzygies of $M$."
"The generating series of these Betti numbers, that is to say, the formal power series $${{\operatorname}{Poin}^{{\operatorname}{}}(M)}:=\sum_n\beta_n(M)t^n$$ is called the *Poincare series* of $M$."
"We define the *residual Poincare series* of $R$ to be the Poincare series of its residue field, and denote it ${{\operatorname}{Poin}^{{\operatorname}{res}}(R)}$."
"If $R\to S$ is a scalar extension, and $F_\bullet$ a minimal free resolution of the residue field $\kappa$ of $R$, then by flatness, $F_\bullet{\otimes}_RS$ is a minimal free resolution of $\kappa{\otimes}_RS$, and the latter is the residue field of $S$, since $R\to S$ is unramified."
"Hence, any two similar rings have the same residual Poincare series."
Let ${\mathbb{SimCM}}$ be the subset of ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ consisting of all similarity classes of local [Cohen-Macaulay]{} rings.
"By [@SchFinEmb Corollary 8.7], if we also fix dimension and multiplicity, then each ${\mathbb{SimCM}}_{d,e}$ is closed under limits."
"\[T:Poinc\] The residual Poincare series is a slope on each class ${\mathbb{SimCM}}_{d,e}$."
The continuity of the map associating to a $d$-dimensional local [Cohen-Macaulay]{} ring $R$ of multiplicity $e$ its residual Poincare series ${{\operatorname}{Poin}^{{\operatorname}{res}}(R)}$ is an immediate consequence of [@SchFinEmb Theorem 11.4].
"Indeed, if ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ is a Cauchy sequence, then, for any fixed $n$, the residue field of each ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$ has the same $n$-th Betti number, for $w$ sufficiently large, by the cited result."
"By [@SchFinEmb Proposition 8.9], this is then also the Betti number of the cataproduct ${R\mathstrut_\sharp}$, that is to say, up to similarity, the limit of the ${R\mathstrut_{w}}$."
"Therefore, ${{\operatorname}{Poin}^{{\operatorname}{res}}({R\mathstrut_{w}})}$ converges, in the $t$-adic topology, to ${{\operatorname}{Poin}^{{\operatorname}{res}}({R\mathstrut_\sharp})}$."
"For a local [Cohen-Macaulay]{} ring $R$, we also define its *canonical Poincare series*, denoted ${{\operatorname}{Poin}^{{\operatorname}{can}}(R)}$, as the Poincare series ${{\operatorname}{Poin}^{{\operatorname}{}}(\omega_{{\widehat {R}}})}$ of the canonical module $\omega_{{\widehat {R}}}$ of its completion ${\widehat {R}}$ (note that the canonical module always exists when the ring is complete; see for instance [@BH §3.3])."
"In particular, $R$ is Gorenstein [if and only if]{} its canonical Poincare series is constant (equal to $1$): indeed, $R$ is Gorenstein [if and only if]{} $\omega_{{\widehat {R}}}{\cong}{\widehat {R}}$."
It is not hard to check that the canonical Poincare series is independent from the choice of representative of a similarity class of a [Cohen-Macaulay]{} local ring (by the same argument as in [@BH Theorem 3.3.5(c)]).
"Let $R$ and $S$ be two rings in ${\mathbb{SimCM}}_{d,e}$ at distance at most $2^{-de-1}$."
"After a scalar extension, we may assume that $R$ and $S$ are complete, with infinite residue fields $\kappa $ and $\lambda$, respectively."
"In particular, there exists a system of parameters ${\mathbf{x}}$ in $R$ such that $\bar R:=R/{\mathbf{x}}R$ has length $e$."
Proposition \[P:metcomp\] then yields a system of parameters ${\mathbf{y}}$ in $S$ such that $\bar R\approx \bar S:=S/{\mathbf{y}}S$.
"Since the canonical module $\omega_R$ is maximal [Cohen-Macaulay]{}, ${\mathbf{x}}$ is $\omega_R$-regular, and likewise, ${\mathbf{y}}$ is $\omega_S$-regular."
"Therefore, $$\label{eq:torcan}
\begin{aligned}
{\operatorname{Tor}^{R}_{n}(\omega_R,\kappa)} &{\cong}{\operatorname{Tor}^{\bar R}_{n}(\omega_R/{\mathbf{x}}\omega_R,\kappa)}\\
{\operatorname{Tor}^{S}_{n}(\omega_S,\lambda)} &{\cong}{\operatorname{Tor}^{\bar S}_{n}(\omega_S/{\mathbf{y}}\omega_S,\lambda)}
\end{aligned}$$ for all $n$."
"Since $\bar R$ and $\bar S$ are similar, they have the same canonical Poincare series $P(t)$."
"By [@BH Theorem 3.3.5], the respective canonical modules of $\bar R$ and $\bar S$ are $\omega_R/{\mathbf{x}}\omega_R$ and $\omega_S/{\mathbf{y}}\omega_S$."
"By , therefore, the canonical Poincare series of $R$ and $S$ are both equal to $P(t)$."
"In conclusion, we showed:

On each ball of radius $2^{-de-1}$ in ${\mathbb{SimCM}}_{d,e}$, the canonical Poincare series is constant."
"In particular, if one of its members is Gorenstein, then so is any."
"Quasi-slopes {#quasi-slopes .unnumbered}
------------

To find a slope, it is enough to have it defined on the countable dense open subset ${\mathbb{Sim}}_0$ given by Theorem \[T:smooth\]."
"For any map $q_0\colon {\mathbb{Sim}}_0\to \mathbb B$ into a complete metric space (not necessarily continuous), define its extension ${\widehat {q}}_0$ as the partial map ${\mathbb{Sim}}\dasharrow  \mathbb B$ given as the limit of the $q_0({J^{n}R})$, for $R$ a Noetherian local ring, whenever this limit exists."
"Note that if $R\approx S$, then $q_0({J^{n}R})$ converges [if and only if]{}$q_0({J^{n}S})$ does, and their limits are similar."
"In particular, $q_0(R)={\widehat {q}}_0(R)$ whenever $R$ is Artinian."
"We call a map $q_0\colon {\mathbb{Sim}}_0\to \mathbb B$ a *quasi-slope*, if ${\widehat {q}}_0$ is everywhere defined."
"By abuse of terminology, we then also refer to this extension $q:={\widehat {q}}_0$ as a quasi-slope."
"In other words, $q\colon {\mathbb{Sim}}\to
\mathbb B$ is a quasi-slope if, $q({J^{n}R})$ converges to $q(R)$, for every Noetherian local ring $R$."
"The following corollary is now immediate from Theorem \[T:smooth\]:

\[C:slope\] Any continuous map $q_0\colon {\mathbb{Sim}}_0\to \mathbb B$ is a quasi-slope and its extension ${\widehat {q}}_0$ is a slope."
"We next show how some of the usual invariants, although in general not slopes, become quasi-slopes when properly modified."
Let $\delta_0$ be defined on ${\mathbb{Sim}}_0$ as follows.
"Given an Artinian local ring $(A,{\mathfrak m})$, let $n$ be its degree of nilpotency (that is to say, the least $k$ such that ${\mathfrak m}^k=0$)."
"Put $$\delta_0(A):=\log_2(\frac{\ell (A)}{\ell ({J^{n/2}A})})$$ where for a postive real number $r$, we define ${J^{r}A}:={J^{z}A}$ with $z:={\operatorname}{int}(r)$ the largest integer less than or equal to $r$."
The map $\delta_0$ is a quasi-slope.
"In fact, ${\widehat {\delta}}_0(R)$ is equal to the dimension of $R$, whenever this dimension is non-zero."
Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring of dimension $d>0$.
"By the Hilbert-Samuel theory, there exists a polynomial $P_R\in{\mathbb Q[t]}$ of degree $d$, such that $\ell({J^{n}R})=P_R(n)$ for $n\gg 0$."
"Hence $\delta_0({J^{n}R})=\log_2(P_R(n)/P_R({\operatorname}{int}(n/2)))$, for $n\gg 0$."
"It is now an exercise to show that for any polynomial $P$ of degree $d$, the limit of $P(n)/P({\operatorname}{int}(n/2))$ is equal to $2^d$."
"In view of this result, we call ${\widehat {\delta}}_0(R)$ the *quasi-dimension* of $R$."
So only Artinian local rings have a quasi-dimension which is different from their (Krull) dimension.
"Using the formula $$\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{P({\operatorname}{int}(\sqrt n))^2}{P(n)}=a_d$$ where $a_d$ is the leading coefficient of a polynomial $P$, we get by a similar argument that the map $\epsilon_0$ defined on ${\mathbb{Sim}}_0$ by the condition $\epsilon_0(A):=(\ell({J^{\sqrt n}A}))^2/\ell(A)$ is a quasi-slope, and ${\widehat {\epsilon}}_0 (R)=e/d!$ whenever $d>0$, where $e$ is the multiplicity of $R$ and $d$ its dimension."
Several questions now arise naturally: what is the nature of the subset of ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ of all Noetherian local rings of a fixed quasi-slope?
Can we break up (or even stratify) ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ in “natural” pieces on which a quasi-slope becomes continuous.
I will conclude with an example of how one can answer the second question for quasi-dimension.
"For a Noetherian local ring $R$, define $\rho(R)$ as the supremum over all $n$ of $${\left|\frac{d!\ell({J^{n}R})}{en^{d-1}}-n\right|}$$ where $d:={\operatorname}{dim}(R)$ and $e:={\operatorname}{mult}(R)$ are respectively the dimension and multiplicity of $R$."
"In other words, $\rho(R)$ is the smallest real number $\rho\geq 0$ such that $$\label{eq:rho}
n^d-\rho n^{d-1} \leq \frac{d!"
"}e\ell({J^{n}R})\leq  n^d+\rho
n^{d-1}$$ for all $n>0$."
That this supremum exists is an easy consequence of the Hilbert-Samuel theory.
"For instance, if $R$ is Artinian of length $l$, then $1\leq \rho(R)\leq
l$, but these bounds are not sharp."
Note that $\rho$ is *not* a quasi-slope (this is easily checked for $R:={\kappa[[t]]}$).
"This new invariant determines the rate of convergence in the definition of the quasi-dimension, as the next result shows."
"To formulate it, we use ${\ulcorner r\lrcorner}$ to denote the rounding to the nearest integer of a real number $r$, that is to say, ${\ulcorner r\lrcorner}$ is the unique integer inside the half open interval $[r-\frac 12,r+\frac 12)$."
"For a Noetherian local ring $R$, if $n\geq 10\rho(R)$, then ${\ulcorner \delta_0({J^{n}R})\lrcorner}$ is equal to its dimension."
"Let $b:=\rho(R)$, and let $d$ and $e$ be the respective dimension and multiplicity of $R$."
"Using , we get estimates $$\label{eq:bn}
1-\frac bn\leq\frac {d!\ell({J^{n}R})}{en^d}\leq 1+\frac bn$$ for all $n$."
"In the convergence of $\delta_0$ we may take the limit over even $n$ only, so let us assume that $n=2m$."
"Dividing inequalities for $2m$ by those for $m$, we get estimates $$2^d\big(\frac {1-\frac b{2m}} {1+\frac bm}\big)\leq\frac
{\ell({J^{2m}R})}{\ell({J^{m}R})}= 2^{\delta_0({J^{n}R})} \leq 2^d\big(\frac {1+\frac b{2m}} {1-\frac
bm}\big).$$ Hence, if the ratio between the two outside fractions is strictly less than $2$, then after taking the logarithm with base two, they become the endpoints of an interval $[\alpha,\beta]$ of length stricly less than one, containing $\delta_0({J^{n}R})$."
"Since $\alpha<d<\beta$, the only integer in $[\alpha,\beta]$ is $d$, showing that ${\ulcorner \delta_0({J^{n}R})\lrcorner}=d$."
"For the ratio to be at most $2$, we need $$(m+\frac b2)(m+b)<2(m-\frac b2)(m-b)$$ and a simple calculation shows that this is true whenever $m>5b$."
"Immediately from this we get:

For each $b\in{\mathbb N}$, let ${\mathbb{Sim}}_{\rho\leq b}$ be the subset of ${\mathbb{Sim}}$ consisting of all Noetherian local rings $R$ such that $\rho(R)\leq b$, thus yielding a filtration ${\mathbb{Sim}}_{\rho\leq 0}\sub {\mathbb{Sim}}_{\rho\leq 1}\sub\dots$ of ${\mathbb{Sim}}$."
Then quasi-dimension is a slope on each ${\mathbb{Sim}}_{\rho\leq b}$.
"A similar argument can be used to show that $\epsilon_0$ is a slope on each ${\mathbb{Sim}}_{\rho\leq b}$, by establishing an analogous bound for the convergence of $\epsilon_0$ to $e/d!$ which only depends on $d:={\operatorname}{dim}(R)$, $e:={\operatorname}{mult}(R)$ and $\rho=:\rho(R)$."
"As far as bounding $\rho$ itself is concerned, if $R$ is [Cohen-Macaulay]{}, then it is bounded as a function of $e$ and $d$ only, but without the [Cohen-Macaulay]{} assumption this is probably false."
"In the latter case, we can use any “big degree” $D$ à la Vasconcelos to arrive at such a bound in terms of $d$ and $D(R)$ (this is an easy consequence of [@RTV Theorem 4.1])."
"Recall (see, for instance, [@Hart III."
Ex.
"5.1]) that the *Euler characteristic* of a projective scheme $X$ is defined by the formula $$\chi(X):=\sum_i (-1)^ih^i(X,{{\mathcal {O}}}_X)$$ where $h^i(X,{{\mathcal {O}}}_X)$ is the vector space dimension of the sheaf cohomology $H^i(X,{{\mathcal {O}}}_X)$."
"In particular, if $X$ is a curve, then $\chi(X)-1$ is the *genus* of $X$."
"The map $\mathbb{Pol}\to \mathbb R$ sending a polarized scheme $\mathfrak
X=(X,\mathcal L)$ to $\chi(X)$ is continuous."
"We calculate the Euler characteristic by means of the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial $P_X(n)$ of $X$ as $$\label{eq:EC}
\chi(X)=P_X(0).$$ In fact, as it is a birational invariant, we may calculate the Euler characteristic by means of any polarization $\mathfrak
X=(X,\mathcal L)$ of $X$."
"The *Hilbert series* of $\mathfrak X$ is defined as $${\operatorname}{Hilb}(X):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty h^0(X,\mathcal L^n)t^n.$$ Let $(R,{\mathfrak m}):={\operatorname}{Vert}(\mathfrak X)$."
"It is not hard to see that $H^0(X,\mathcal L^n){\cong}{\mathfrak m}^n/{\mathfrak m}^{n+1}$ and hence that $X$ and $R$ have the same Hilbert series and the same Hilbert-Samuel polynomial."
"Moreover, the connection between the Hilbert series $h(t)$ and the corresponding Hilbert-Samuel polynomial $P(n)$ is given by the formula $$\label{eq:hilb}
P(n)= \sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \frac{(-1)^j}{j!}"
"{{\bigl( \begin{matrix} n+d-1-j\crn\cr\end{matrix} \bigr)}}{\left.\frac{\partial^j}{\partial
t}\big((1-t)^dh(t)\big)\right|_{{t=1}}},$$ where $d$ is the degree of $P$ (that is to say, the dimension of $X$)."
"Moreover, if $h_i$ are Hilbert series with corresponding Hilbert polynomial $P_i$, then from the fact that $${\left.\frac{\partial^j}{\partial t}\big((1-t)^dt^n\big)\right|_{{t=1}}} =0$$ for all $j<d$ and all $n$, we get from that $P_1=P_2$ whenever $h_1$ and $h_2$ are $t$-adically close."
"Therefore, by Proposition \[P:Hilb\] and , the Euler characteristic is continuous."
"Future work {#future-work .unnumbered}
-----------

In work in progress ([@SchSchGr]), we assign to any Artinian $\kappa$-algebra, with $\kappa$ an [algebraically closed field]{} of size the continuum, a first-order formula modulo the theory of Artinian $\kappa$-algebras."
"Associating to this theory its Grothendieck ring $K_0:=K_0(\kappa)$ on pp-formulae, we get a map ${\mathbb{SimAn}}_0(\kappa)\to K_0\colon R\mapsto [ R]$, which is compatible with direct sum and tensor product, and which becomes injective when we replace the isomorphism relation with a stable version of it."
"Hence, we may associate to any analytic germ $R$, its *formal Hilbert series* $${\operatorname}{Hilb}^{{\operatorname}{form}}(R) :=\sum_n  [{J^{n}R}] t^n\in{K_0[[t]]}$$ This would yield a complete invariant modulo the Grothendieck ring $K_0$ (this Grothendieck ring, however, admits the classical Grothendieck ring of $\kappa$ as a homomorphic image, whence is potentially a very complicated object)."

Virtual reality: from the development laboratory to the classroom.
"In conclusion, in order for virtual reality simulations to move from the R & D laboratory to the teaching classroom on a large scale basis, there are four conditions which must be met: faculty involvement, student cooperation, affordable equipment and administrative support."
1.
Faculty must understand the advantages of using VR simulations and be committed to developing the procedures and teaching modules and evaluating their effectiveness.
They must understand that the simulations are another teaching tool and not a substitute for the teacher.
2.
Students must be guided in the use of VR simulations to develop the level of skill required.
Students must be willing to accept new ways of learning and must be able to see their individual learning progress in skill development.
3.
"Equipment-Must be realistic, affordable, available and clearly demonstrate advantages over traditional methods of teaching."
4.
"Administrative Support-Initially the cost of instituting VR simulations may be more than using other traditional teaching tools, thus ongoing financial support is very important."
I believe that the faculty of the Nursing Department at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh is showing the way in incorporating VR simulations into a traditional undergraduate nursing program and as a result they are changing forever the way we will prepare health professionals for the future.

Ride or Die Chick vs."
"The Good Black Woman

I know a lot of my posts relate back to something that Belle in Brooklyn has written."
But isn't that what a good blog does?
Create conversation?
She is a relationship writer.
"I'm not in one right now, and even though she is a couple of years younger than me, I still take note on what she says."
Today's blog was about Ride or Die Chicks.
"Specifically, how she did not see herself as a ride or die chick that would be there for her man when he called her from the police station at 2am after doing something dumb."
"""As an adult (21+), I’ve managed to keep myself out of dumb situations that will get me locked up or detained."
"I’m good for being the chick that’s like “um, I’m going home” or simply staying home when I think trouble might be coming."
I don’t roll with people too long that consistently participate in reckless behavior.
I expect other adults in my world to be moderately responsible and law-abiding too.
"I don’t think I am asking too much."""
said Belle.
"She then told the story about how one of her male friends was so pleased that he had found himself a ""ride-or-die chick"" due to her angry and physical reaction to his partying in the club, a dead cell phone on his hip, while she called him repeatedly, trying to find out if he was inside of said club that she could not make her way into (they were supposed to be meeting) and not knowing exactly where he was."
"So, I decided to leave a comment:

If ""Ride or Die Chicks"" are the ones who are at the precinct at 2am, then I'd rather be just a plain ol' good black woman any day of the week."
A question about your friend and Gold Dresses Tai: is there a reason he didn't think to maybe check outside to see if she had shown up as opposed to just partying the night away?
Or did he do that and you just didn't mention that?
"Because I'm thinking that yeah, maybe he is in love with his ""ride or die chick"", but if I was Tai, I don't know if I would be too crazy in love with someone who would leave me out on the curb wondering if I was okay or not while he got his party on in the club."
"One of Belle's male friends left the following comments:

Just out of curiosity and with all due respect - how many of you non-ride or die chicks have a man (a good man)?"
"(This query applies to you as well Belle)… You don’t have to be honest with us, but be honest with yourselves."
P.S.
Being a ride or die chick does not simply apply to being the chick we call when we are locked up.
That is not all our realities nor was it the reality for the man mentioned in this story when he realized he had one.
"It's knowing you have a woman with you no matter what for whatever, whenever, wherever."
"We live in a remote control society, the minute we see something we do not like (commercials), we change the channel, and walk away."
"Dude, please."
"There is nothing okay with someone partying the night away, knowing full well that your woman is looking for you."
Especially when she was right OUTSIDE.
Did it occur to you to maybe check for her?
(No one has answered that yet).
That is just straight up rude.
She flipped on you because she cared about your inconsiderate self and you had her worried to death.
That's not being a ride or die chick.
"It's checking you for your rude behavior and letting you know that if you even think to do it again, she most likely WILL ""change the channel"" on your behind."
"So you know I had to write back:

I can be honest and say no, I don't have a man right now."
Why?
"It's because I've been down that road of the 2am phone calls at the police station (and, sadly, far worse situations)."
"And, quite frankly, now at age 30?"
"I don't want to deal with it anymore.I think Belle broke it down perfectly:

""Standard shit?"
"Fine, I’ll deal."
Just human shit?
"Fine, I’ll deal."
Life shit?
No problem.
I got you.
But utterly dumb (or disrespectful or embarrassing) shit?
"No."""
What is so wrong with that?
"I still say there is a difference between being a ""ride or die chick"" and being just a ""plain ol' Good Black Woman""."
"Back in my ride or die chick days, dealing with Knuckleheads was completely me."
I was also between the ages of 18 and 25 and didn't have a clue what a real man was.
No--correction: I knew what a real man was.
My dad was a prime example of what a good man was.
"At that age, I was a dreamer and felt that the Knuckleheads would grow out of their immaturity and their tendency to being inconsiderate more than kind."
I learned the hard way that this is not the case for some of them.
I'm not arrogant enough to call myself the epitome of a Good Black Woman.
LOL!
I fully recognize that I am working on it.
But I have no desire to be a ride or die chick anymore.
There is always a line that can be crossed.
There will always be a non-negotiable that will cause the channel to be turned.
"Good Black Women recognize that, and for the preservation of themselves, and their sanity, they will cut their losses and keep it moving."
I think dude has a Good Black Woman on his hands.
Period.
He is blessed to have her.
"And, that episode aside, dude seems like a Good Black Man."
I hope to be a Good Black Woman to a Good Black Man one day.

Same Stuff...Different Day..."
I have no words.
Not Today.
"It would just be a curse-ladden tirade that would begin with the words: ""This is some straight up bullsh*t!"""
And I like to believe that my parents paid for my education so I can express myself more eloquently than that.
"Still....*sighs*....

Update: I posted this in the comments section of A Belle In Brooklyn's page in response to her post."
She summed up what I was feeeling.
What I am STILL feeling.
"*sighs*

I really tried to blog about this."
"But I couldn't without it being just this tirade of ""f*cking bullsh*t"" and ""sorry a$$ muthaf*cking cops"", etc."
"I was hoping for the best, but already knew what was coming down the pipeline."
As I stated on my page: Same Stuff.
Different Day.
"We've now gone past the ""racist"" cop arguement."
"Now, this is a perceived class and economic status issue."
"Did you hear the way the PBA head talked about how they'd ""had their eye on that Club Kalua"" as if to say that well, they must have known what a slummy club it was, so they shouldn't have been there."
"But since they were, we assumed they were part of the slum."
Ugh.
I can't.
I really just can't...being a native New Yorker?
I'm really just sick and tired of the bullsh*t that the some members of the NYPD get away with every.damn.day.
From cold-blooded murder all the way down to pulling folks over for Driving While Black.
"I wonder what kind of tragedy has to happen between cops and a civilian in NYC for someone to say ""what a damn minute!"

Three-Oh (Part One)

Original Post Date: Saturday June 23, 2007 - 06:11pm

Sometimes you read something that kinda slaps you in the face."
And you can't help but stop and reflect on it.
I ran across a blog post from a former friend today.
Even though she and I have long since stopped talking--because of my stupidity--I still have checked in on her blog.
"Nosiness, yes, but also to watch her growth."
"Now, she doesn't post often, but she did post something on her blog on my birthday."
Only people who know the situation would know that the post is about what happened to end our newly budding friendship and the significance of posting it on that day.
"It ripped at me like nothing I could really describe because it so eloquently versed what I have known about myself and my ""relationships"" with others in my life...the whole very ugly, very dark side of me that came out during that time."
And over someone who was and is COMPLETELY NOT WORTH IT!
"My other female friends at the time, doing what friends do, told me that it was her, not me, that was the crazy one."
But I have always known that I handled that situation in such a high school manner.
"The same behavior that I have been known to criticize in others, I exemplified to the thousandth degree during that time."
"I wanted to post a comment on her blog, telling her that she was so right to have walked away from that girl she had talked about in her poem at that time."
"Because that girl in the poem that had hurt her trust so was just that--a girl trying to walk in woman shoes, and failing miserably."
"I can say that now, a few years later, I have gotten better."
No more a sucka 4 love.
Learning more & more everyday how to put on my big girl panties and get over certain things that life throws my way.
But I still have a long way to go.
Maybe this will be the year.
"The age of ""young and dumb"" had passed now."
"Thank you, for posting that poem."
"It reminds me that for as far as I have come from that moment, I still have a long way to go"
"Since Microsoft acquired Xamarin earlier this year and made it available for free along with Visual Studio following Build 2016, developers can now leverage both solutions to build apps for all major platforms."
"But if this combo was not enough to ease the work the work of .NET and C# developers, mobile database platform Realm has just announced Realm Xamarin, a new edition of their database built specifically for the Xamarin framework."
"If you’re not familiar with it, Realm is a popular database solution already used by developers such as Twitter, Starbucks, Cisco, Walmart, Google, Amazon, eBay and more."
"After launching for Java, Objective‑C, and Swift in 2014 and for React Native earlier in 2016, the new Xamarin support is great news for developers who already rely on the Microsoft framework to write their apps."
"Realm shared additional technical details on their blog post today:

Realm Xamarin brings the modern design & simplicity you expect from Realm, and will allow you to target both iOS and Android with the same codebase."
"Like the other editions of Realm, it is designed from the ground up to enable reactive app development, with live objects, change events, and support for unidirectional data flows."
"Please note the Realm file format is also completely cross-platform, allowing data to be shared across iOS & Android easily."
"We currently support Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android, and look forward to supporting Xamarin.Mac in the future, as well as UWP and Unity."
"Realm Xamarin is already available on GitHub, and the team is asking developers to provide feedback on bugs and feature requests."
"Furthermore, Realm shares that we can “expect the API to improve significantly over the next few weeks, especially as we polish advanced features like migrations and queries.” Do you think Xamarin developers will welcome the native support for an easy-to-use mobile database platform to build their apps?"
Please tell us what you think in the comments.

"INTRODUCTION
============

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the movement and posture of a patient due to non-progressive damage of immature brain."
It affects patients throughout their life \[[@b1-arm-2018-42-5-722]\].
"CP is a complex disorder with various medical problems, including intellectual disability, sensory impairment such as hearing and vision loss, epilepsy, and so on \[[@b2-arm-2018-42-5-722],[@b3-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"Depending on the severity of CP and its associated problems, various treatments are needed for each patient."
"In addition, CP is typically diagnosed in childhood through a patient's growth and development, although several musculoskeletal problems and functional deterioration can also occur."
Continuous therapy and management are needed to minimize the disability related to CP and secondary complications throughout the patient's life.
Various therapies for CP have been published \[[@b4-arm-2018-42-5-722]\].
Considerable medical and social costs are needed for these treatments and special care.
"In the United States, the lifetime cost for patients with CP has been reported to be 11.5 billion US dollars \[[@b5-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"In Korea, patients are required to be enrolled in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)."
The NHIS is the only public medical insurance institution.
It is operated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Korea.
"The National Health Information Database (NHID) is a public database including data on healthcare utilization, health screening, socio-demographic variables, and mortality for the entire population of Korea."
It was formed by the NHIS in 2012 \[[@b6-arm-2018-42-5-722]\].
"In Korea, healthcare benefits are provided for rehabilitation as well as diagnosis, drugs, treatments, and surgery."
"Rehabilitation therapy includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and hydrotherapy, all of which are necessary for patients with CP."
Botulinum toxin injection (BTx) for the control of spasticity in CP patients is also covered by NHIS if certain criteria are met.
Healthcare services also include non-benefit items.
A patient who receives health care treatment pays a certain portion of the healthcare cost as a 'co-payment'.
The co-payment rate is determined separately from the cost incurred by the inpatient or outpatient service according to the healthcare institution level and type.
Typical copayment amounts are 20% of inpatient hospital care and 30%--50% of outpatient care.
"Although an option is available to support medical expenses in the case of rare and incurable diseases, it does not apply to CP cases."
"Thus, families with a CP patient live with a financial burden due to medical expenses incurred during the patient's life."
"In some other countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada, all medical expenses are funded through the National Health Service \[[@b7-arm-2018-42-5-722]-[@b9-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"Even in some countries such as the United States where private health insurance system is operated, the state is responsible for medical expenses for children with disabilities \[[@b7-arm-2018-42-5-722],[@b10-arm-2018-42-5-722],[@b11-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"In the case of Japan, individuals also pay a certain amount of the entire medical expense while the national health insurance funds the remaining expenses."
"However, it should be noted that disabled children in Japan are mostly supported by the government in the case of inpatient rehabilitation therapy \[[@b12-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
The type and amount of management required differ depending on the age of patients with CP.
"During childhood, management for CP focuses on achieving maximum development milestones and preventing future complications."
"In school age and adolescence, treatment for CP needs to prevent musculoskeletal problems and functional deterioration."
"Even in adulthood, continuous care of these musculoskeletal problems and pain reduction are essential for CP patients."
Management of complications that may occur with aging is also necessary.
"Previous studies have shown that CP patients who are able to walk independently during childhood gradually become non-ambulatory over time due to various problems \[[@b13-arm-2018-42-5-722],[@b14-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify rehabilitation treatment cost according to age by using NHID for patients with CP and investigate the change over time."
"MATERIALS AND METHODS
=====================

This study was conducted based on records from the NHID for 7 years from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2013."
We used all records of medical claims for all enrollees.
Patients were identified as having CP if their claim records included at least two diagnostic codes according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (KCD).
"Codes representing CP included spastic CP (G8000, 8001, 8002, 8008, 8009, 8100-8103, 8109-8113, 8119, 8190-8193, 8199, 830-833), dyskinetic CP (G803), ataxic CP (G804), and unspecified (G808)."
All patients with CP were divided into three groups according to age: 0--6 years corresponding to infants and toddlers; 7--18 years corresponding to school age and adolescence; and 19 years or older corresponding to adults.
These patients were analyzed based on treatment claim data related to CP.
"Costs of rehabilitation therapy including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and hydrotherapy were investigated through NHID data."
We analyzed inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation costs separately.
Costs of BTx were investigated using corresponding billing procedure codes or corresponding billing drug codes.
Costs of orthopedic surgery for correcting musculoskeletal deformity and selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) in CP patients were also investigated.
"Speech and language therapy, cognitive therapy, and the use of an intrathecal baclofen pump were excluded from analysis of treatment costs because they were non-benefit items not supported by NHIS."
Costs of assistive devices and appliances for disability were also excluded from the analysis.
Insurance-covered costs included both insurer's payment and patient's co-payment for medical services.
"All data were analyzed through Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)."
"RESULTS
=======

Number of patients with cerebral palsy
--------------------------------------

The number of patients with CP increased from 110,557 in 2007 to 130,032 in 2013."
"By age group, it decreased from 7,401 in 2007 to 5,979 in 2013 for the 0--6 years age group."
"On the other hand, it increased from 7,293 in 2007 to 8,585 in 2013 for the 7--18 years age group and increased from 95,863 in 2007 to 115,468 in 2013 for the 19 years or older age group."
"Rehabilitation therapy of patients with cerebral palsy
------------------------------------------------------

The proportion of patients who had received rehabilitation therapy on admission or on an outpatient basis among all CP patients has increased in recent years."
"By age group, 76.4% of all patients with CP in 2007 were treated in the 0--6 years age group."
It increased to 77.8% in 2013.
"In the case of the 7--18 years age group, this increased from 46.5% in 2007 to 55.3% in 2013."
"For the 19 years or older age group, it increased from 31.5% in 2007 to 40.5% in 2013."
The number of patients changed over time.
The pattern of change also differed among different age groups.
"In the 0--6 and 7--18 years age groups, more patients received outpatient rehabilitation therapy than inpatient therapy."
"However, patients aged 19 years or older were more likely to undergo inpatient rehabilitation therapy than outpatient therapy."
"In the case of hospitalized patients, the proportion of patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation therapy increased in recent years in all age groups."
The proportion of patients in the 0--6 years age group increased from 18.8% in 2007 to 23.4% in 2013.
"In the 7--18 years age group, the proportion increased from 7.4% in 2007 to 8.2% in 2013."
"In the 19 years or older age group, it increased from 20.8% in 2007 to 32.2% in 2013."
The proportion of patients receiving outpatient rehabilitation therapy in the 0--6 years age group was relatively constant.
It was 72.8% in 2007 and 73.1% in 2013.
The proportion increased from 44.1% in 2007 to 52.6% in 2013 in the 7--18 years age group but decreased from 14.2% in 2007 to 11.5% in 2013 in the 19 years or older age group ([Fig.
"1](#f1-arm-2018-42-5-722){ref-type=""fig""})."
"From 2007 to 2013, the total cost of rehabilitation therapy including inpatient and outpatient increased for all age groups."
The total cost was significantly higher in the 0--6 years age group and 19 years or older age group than that in the 7--18 years age group (p\<0.05).
"As of 2013, the total cost of rehabilitation therapy was KRW 6,229,639 for the 0--6 years age group, KRW 5,796,557 for the 7--18 years age group, and KRW 6,462,095 for the 19 years or older age group."
"The inpatient rehabilitation therapy cost per person increased 1.9 times from KRW 2,466,698 in 2007 to KRW 4,776,701 in 2013 for the 0--6 years age group."
"For the 7--18 years age group, it increased 2.4 times from KRW 1,587,026 in 2007 to KRW 3,773,249 in 2013."
"In the 19 years or older age group, the inpatient rehabilitation therapy cost increased 1.9 times from KRW 2,738,917 in 2007 to KRW 5,232,401 in 2013."
"In the case of outpatient rehabilitation therapy for the 0--6 years age group, the cost increased 1.2 times from KRW 1,185,188 in 2007 to KRW 1,452,938 in 2013."
"For the 7--18 years age group, the cost increased 1.5 times from KRW 1,344,596 in 2007 to KRW 2,023,308 in 2013."
"For the 19 years or older age group, it increased 1.3 times from KRW 930,028 in 2007 to KRW 1,229,694 in 2013 ([Fig."

"Botulinum toxin injection treatment of cerebral palsy patients
--------------------------------------------------------------

BTx injection treatment was most frequently performed for the 0--6 years age group."
"From 2007 to 2013, the proportion of patients undergoing BTx treatment did not change significantly over time in the 0--6 or 7--18 years age group."
"However, the proportion increased in the 19 years or older age group ([Fig."
"3](#f3-arm-2018-42-5-722){ref-type=""fig""})."
"On the other hand, the injection cost per person increased in all age groups."
"The cost per person increased 6.7 times from KRW 62,619 in 2007 to KRW 420,687 in 2013 in the 0--6 years age group."

"For the 19 years or older age group, it increased 9.0 times from KRW 62,350 in 2007 to KRW 561,736 in 2103."
"Orthopedic surgery for cerebral palsy patients
----------------------------------------------

Observing orthopedic surgery patterns according to age groups revealed that more orthopedic surgeries were performed for the 7--18 years age group of CP patients."
"The proportion of patients who underwent orthopedic surgery among all patients with CP decreased over time for all age groups: from 1.9% in 2007 to 1.1% in 2013 for the 0--6 years age group, from 5.7% in 2007 to 4.0% in 2013 for the 7--18 years age group, and from 0.15% in 2007 to 0.1% in 2013 for the 19 years or older age group ([Fig."
"4](#f4-arm-2018-42-5-722){ref-type=""fig""})."
The cost of orthopedic surgery was increased rapidly for the 19 years or older age group.
"The cost of surgery per person was similar from 2007 to 2013 for both 0--6 and 7--18 years age groups However, the cost per person aged 19 years or older increased by 6.3 times from KRW 649,049 in 2007 to KRW 4,081,413 in 2013."
"Selective dorsal rhizotomy for cerebral palsy patients
------------------------------------------------------

When we observed SDR data, we found that this operation was performed very rarely in all age groups."
It was most commonly performed for the 7--18 years age group.
"For the 0--6 years age group, the number of SDRs performed was decreased."
"The average cost of surgery per person was KRW 338,058--413,190."
This has remained constant without any increase or decrease over time from 2007 to 2013.
"Total cost of treatment for cerebral palsy patients
---------------------------------------------------

Total cost of treatment per person for each age group combined with rehabilitation therapy, BTx, orthopedic surgery, and SDR is as follows: (1) for the 0--6 years age group, the cost of treatment per person increased 1.7 times from KRW 4,697,811 in 2007 to KRW 8,066,013 in 2013; (2) for the 7--18 years age group, it increased 1.9 times from KRW 4,023,713 in 2007 to KRW 7,448,412 in 2013; (3) for the 19 years or older age group, it increased 2.6 times from KRW 11,518,434 in 2007 to KRW 4,380,344 in 2013."
"On average, over the 7 years of treatment, expenditure of treatment was higher in the following order: aged 19 years or older \> aged 0--6 \> aged 7--18 ([Fig."
"5](#f5-arm-2018-42-5-722){ref-type=""fig""})."
"DISCUSSION
==========

The present study was conducted to investigate rehabilitation treatment expenditures for patients with CP according to NHID data."
"Results of this study revealed that annual physical therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy, and botulinum toxin injection cost per person were increased over time."
"On the other hand, the number of orthopedic surgery and SDR was reduced."
The total cost of treatment per person showed a tendency of increase for all age groups.
"While CP is a disease that occurs in childhood, it affects patients throughout their life."
"In CP, brain damage is static while functional status and abilities will change."
"To reduce the rate and prevent these functional impairments, ongoing comprehensive care and management are needed \[[@b15-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
Conservative and/or surgical treatments of multiple musculoskeletal problems and pain that may occur with age are also required.
Results of this study confirmed that many treatment costs might incur even after the patient reached adulthood.
"According to the National Statistical Yearbook of National Health Insurance released in 2015, the health expenditure per person according to the age group was about KRW 1,241,778 for 0-year-old, KRW 1,023,604 for 1--4 years old, KRW 649,854 for 5--9 years old, KRW 417,542 for 10--14 years old, and KRW 400,845 for 15--19 years old."
"In this study, only CP-related medical expenditure was examined."
"General medical expenses not associated with CP such as common colds, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were excluded."
"Nevertheless, it was found that costs incurred by patients with CP were significantly more than the average medical expenditure of the entire population."
"According to unpublished results of work undertaken by the authors, about 25%--30% of children diagnosed with CP received inpatient rehabilitation treatment while about 60%--80% of them received outpatient rehabilitation treatment."
"According to a study based on the Korean Database of Cerebral Palsy \[[@b16-arm-2018-42-5-722]\], more than 70% of children with CP were classified as levels II--V in the Gross Motor Function Classification System."
"Based on these results, while almost all CP patients should have been receiving rehabilitation treatment in childhood, the actual rate of treatment was insufficient."
"This suggests that rehabilitation costs included in this study might have been underestimated compared to the actual rehabilitation costs required by all CP children, implying more expenditure may be required for proper treatment of CP children."
"In other countries, according to a report released by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average lifetime economic cost per CP patient increased from US \$503,000 in 1992 to US \$921,000 in 2003 \[[@b5-arm-2018-42-5-722],[@b17-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"According to a study published in Denmark, the average lifetime economic cost per CP patient is estimated to be US \$961,000 \[[@b18-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
Observation of the pattern of rehabilitation therapy according to age revealed that the 0--6 years age group received more inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation than the 7--18 years age group.
Chiarello et al.
\[[@b19-arm-2018-42-5-722]\] have reported that younger children receive regular treatment with a frequency of one to five times per week.
"In contrast, older children receive treatment on an episodic basis according to their specific needs."
"In the age group of 19 years or older, the proportion of outpatient treatment decreased while the rate of hospitalization increased."
This may be because it is difficult to treat CP patients at home after they become adults.
"In addition, many medical problems can occur."
"They may require more hospitalization in adulthood than in childhood or adolescence \[[@b15-arm-2018-42-5-722],[@b20-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"In this study, while the analysis did not include treatment cost for general medical problems, the possibility that physical therapy and occupational therapy were performed together during admission due to other medical problems might have some impact on the increment tendency of hospitalization costs in the 19 years or older group."
"In Korea, since 2008, the day hospital system was established as a way to provide rehabilitation therapy for children with disabilities."
It is a type of medical treatment that is carried out in the hospital for 6 or more hours per day.
Patients can participate in various rehabilitation programs and then return home in the evening.
"For this method, medical expenses are paid based on hospitalization rate."
"In this study, the increased rate of hospitalization for 0--6 years old children was higher than that for outpatient treatment."
It might be partly attributed to the increase in day hospital treatment for intensive rehabilitation.
Insurance coverage for BTx treatment was initiated in 2005.
"Then in November 2006, the insurance benefit of the motor point block (the injection of a certain drug at a motor point of a muscle) was established."
The upper age limit of the insurance policy increased from 5 years old to 7 years old in December 2007.
The highest amount of BTx.
administered in the 0--6 years age group would be within the limit of the insurance policy describing insurance benefits.
Our results showed that the cost of BTx injection was increased more than five times from 2007 to 2013.
This seems to be due to an increase in toxin dose per person after insurance coverage had been initiated as well as the policy change over time which provided compensation for injectable needle and cost of procedures.
"According to results of this study, orthopedic surgery was performed the most often in the age group of 7--18 years while the total number of orthopedic surgeries decreased each year."
"A variety of orthopedic surgeries are performed to treat multiple musculoskeletal problems, including joint contracture that can occur in patients with CP."
"Single-event multilevel surgery (SEMLS) is now considered to be one of the standard treatments to improve gait and function of patients with bilateral spastic CP whereas single-level surgeries such as isolated gastroc soleus lengthening were performed sequentially over several events in the past \[[@b21-arm-2018-42-5-722],[@b22-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
Effects of SEMLS on patients with CP have been investigated in several studies.
The average age of patients undergoing surgery is around 8 to 12 years of age.
Results of this study are consistent with results of previous studies showing that orthopedic surgery is performed most frequently in the 7--18 years age group.
"In young children aged 0--6, treatment with BTx accounts for a large portion of treatment for spasticity-related problems caused by CP."
"However, as age increases, the proportion of orthopedic surgery to solve musculoskeletal problems increases."
The number of SDRs performed in patients with CP was low in the total number of cases.
This rendered it difficult to accurately analyze the pattern.
SDR was advocated by Foerster in 1908.
It has been widely used as an effective treatment to reduce lower limb spasticity in patients with CP \[[@b23-arm-2018-42-5-722]\].
"However, serious complications related to SDR procedure have been reported and the number of procedures performed has gradually decreased \[[@b23-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"In recent years, the procedure has been supplemented to increase its safety."
It is now being used as a treatment option for severe spasticity along with an intrathecal baclofen pump \[[@b24-arm-2018-42-5-722]\].
The total treatment cost associated with CP has been increasing steadily.
This increasing tendency is more pronounced in the 19 years or older group than that in the other two age groups.
"Especially in the adult group, a large increase is observed in areas of rehabilitation therapy and orthopedic surgery, suggesting that continuous treatment is needed to solve problems such as functional deterioration, pain, and arthritis which may occur in patients with CP during their lifetime."
Only a few studies on the expenditure of medical care for patients with CP have been carried out in Korea.
In a study conducted by Park et al.
"\[[@b25-arm-2018-42-5-722]\], the health care cost of patients with CP was analyzed for 5 years from 2004 to 2008 using data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA)."
"The 'healthcare cost' in the study included surgery, medication, physical therapy, orthotics, and hospitalization costs related to CP."
The authors concluded that medical expenses related to CP were higher for younger patients.
"The lifetime expenditure on CP was about US \$26,383 per person, which was 1.8 times higher than the medical expenditure per person for non-CP patients at US \$14,579 \[[@b25-arm-2018-42-5-722]\]."
"However, the lifetime healthcare cost was sourced from discounted rates, not from actual expenses."
Kim et al.
\[[@b26-arm-2018-42-5-722]\] have compared treatment expenditures for different ages for children aged 1 to 18 years with CP using data from HIRA.
"They reported that expenditure on rehabilitation was the highest in childhood, followed by that in preschool, adolescence, and after school age."
"In the present study, health insurance claim data were used whereas HIRA data were used in previous studies."
"Thus, analyzed medical expenditure and age groups differed."
These results are somewhat difficult to compare directly.
"However, in both current and previous studies, results showed greater expenditure related to CP for infants and toddlers than that for school age and adolescence."
This study is meaningful as it is the first study to analyze expenditure for patients with CP of all age groups using actual claim data.
One of the limitations of this study is that only treatment items covered by NHIS could be included in the analysis.
"Second, the cost of medication, assistive devices, and appliances for disability could not be included."
"Third, we did not subdivide age groups any further."
"Lastly, the reliance on diagnostic codes to identify CP might have induced inaccuracy of the results for target patients due to the nature of claims data."
"In conclusion, this study investigated the cost of treatment for patients with CP using NHID data."
"Results demonstrate that annual physical therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy, and BTx costs per person have been increasing rapidly."
"On the other hand, the number of orthopedic surgeries and SDRs performed has decreased."
Results of this study are expected to be used as a basis for establishing insurance policies and support systems for medical expenses of patients with CP in the future.

The objective of this study was to identify predictors of relapse and determine the predictive score for relapse in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.
Ninety-nine children with nephrotic syndrome visiting the pediatric nephrology outpatient clinic of Soetomo Hospital from 1983 to 2001 were studied.
"There were 63 children with relapses (50 infrequent relapses, 13 frequent relapses) and 36 children without a relapse for at least 1 year after beginning steroid treatment, which served as a control group."
"The selected variables were grouped into non-renal factors (age, sex, nutritional status, infection) and renal factors (histopathologic findings, hypertension, hematuria, azotemia, hypocomplementemia, rapidity of early steroid response, number of relapses within the first 6 months, time-interval between early steroid response and first relapse)."
"Using the discriminant analysis function test, it was found that the statistically significant predictors of relapse were the time-interval between early steroid response and the first relapse, number of relapses within the first 6 months, infection during the first relapse, hematuria and sex."
"A prediction score can be determined using 3, 5 or 6 parameters by including the rapidity of early steroid response."
"It’s under debate (mostly because there is no hard science in this area), but people say that anywhere from January 17th to January 27th is the most depressing day of the year."
This is largely based on Northern Hemisphere’s suicide rates and other data associated with depression.
"You probably agree if you’ve ever felt that sinking slipping away of November, the rock bottom of January… and don’t get me started about the frustration of March – when it’s supposed to be SPRING already, goddammit!"
"Having grown up in Richmond, VA, and after spending extended periods (and winters) in northern Germany, Cleveland, and Vienna, I eventually drew a correlation."
"My longest, hardest periods of depression always coincided with darkness."
"It wasn’t as much the cold as it was the darkness, but the cold (and wind) certainly did not help either."
I’ve always been intrigued by what it is about winter that makes me so tired and sad and lethargic.
"How it works, why it’s so bad, and when to expect the sadness to arrive and then leave me alone."
"Of course, this is because I want to believe that if I know the how, why, and when, then I’ll magically be equipped with the tools and know-how to put it in a box and lock it away somewhere where it can’t hurt me anymore."
"Unfortunately, that’s not how these things work."
"However, once I took that very important step of recognizing the pattern and acknowledging the problem, by age 23 I had developed an arsenal of tools for how to stave off some of my symptoms."
SLEEP!
"Our bodies are demanding it, so put down the coffee and go to bed early."
"I chose this topic for my guest post on Tina Muir’s blog last summer, but I find it even more difficult to restrict my caffeine intake in the winter."
"If you’re like I was and can’t imagine parting with that hot morning beverage, maybe you can try replacing it with Cocoa Elite (for 10% off, use code Esther-0001)."

Dawn simulators do amazing things.
It turns out I’m just plain bad at transitions.
"I don’t do well going from cold to hot, asleep to awake, summer to winter, etc."
"I got this baby for the first time 7 years ago in Vienna (home of the darkest, most overcast winter I’ve ever survived) and it was a lifesaver, but I’m sure newer models are just as good if not better!"

Electric blankets!
They are cheap and amazing.
"I didn’t have a bathtub in the last few places I’ve lived, so I used this as a replacement, but it turned out to be an even better solution and it saves water."
"Especially after a long run in the cold, I would turn it on full blast and wrap myself up in it until I’d sweat."

And while we’re talking about classes – I recommend starting something new !
I started taking ballet classes for the first time in over 15 years this fall.
"Part of the problem with winter is the monotony of it, so put yourself out there."
Sign up for dance or art or dog agility.
You’ll be glad you did.
"Plus, it’s a great way to get yourself out of the house on cold evenings and be around other people."

Natural light is your best friend.
Open the blinds and stay near a window whenever you can.
Even having lunch out in your car on a sunny day is better than sitting inside a room surrounded by walls.

Invest in a big fat winter coat .
There are almost always some fun and affordable options at any second-hand store.
Forget about fashion.
The most important thing is that it is super warm.
My lifesaver during college in Cleveland was a bright yellow boy’s youth large ski jacket from Old Navy.
"I remember lying in bed, dreading leaving the house, and then I’d remember “Big Yellow,” and I’d pop right out of bed."

"My personal favorites are TED Radio Hour, RadioLab, This American Life, Freakonomics, Planet Money, Invisibilia, and Serial (all of which can also be found for free in your iTunes store)."
"If you’re looking for one to get you hooked (and haven’t heard it yet), try the first season of Serial."
"That’ll get you out running in the dark, wind and snow or on the hot treadmill at the gym."
"Or… if you have other crazy busy runner friends who you never get to see, just set up regular running dates with them and most importantly, never cancel."

Get out!
My sister has started planning a fun trip for herself every year during the month of February.
"She always makes her plans in the fall, before winter even has a chance to start settling in."
"Even if going somewhere warmer or sunnier isn’t an option, just having something exciting to look forward to will break up the monotony and keep you going."
"And then, when you get back, it’s just a few more weeks until spring, and it’ll be getting lighter and warmer from there on out."

"I hate to admit it, but as a last resort, I have also used a tanning bed up to 3 times per winter, and it works."
"This is something I’ll only do if I can feel that the darkness and cold have already caught up with me, and it’s one way to feel warm and alive and awake again."
It has nothing to do with looking tan and everything to do with the intensity of light and warmth all around me in that tanning bed.

And one more thing… that liquor jacket doesn’t do anything to keep us warm or protect us from the darkness of winter.
It ruins sleep quality and the dehydration and hangovers just leave us more isolated and depressed when it’s over.
Not to mention the fact that it will be a sure-fire contributor to that layer of fat that most of us put on in the winter.
"While I was with ZAP, my Seasonal Affective Disorder was almost a non-issue due to our long winter training camps in Tallahassee and Greenville, SC."
"And this year, with the Trials in February, I decided not to take any chances and flew south to Tallahassee again."
"I am super lucky to be able to afford this option both financially (thanks to RRCA, the New York Athletic Club, and Skechers) and scheduling-wise (thanks to Appalachian State University Track and Field for letting me just disappear from the mountains this winter)."
"But for those of you who don’t have that kind of flexibility, hopefully at least some of the tips above will help you make it through the darkness!"

392 So.2d 1318 (1981)
THE FLORIDA BAR, Complainant,
v.
Andrew BARON, Respondent."
Nos.
"57041, 58273, 58051 and 58228."
Supreme Court of Florida.
"January 15, 1981."
"*1319 David G. McGunegle, Branch Staff Counsel and John B. Root, Jr., Asst."
"Staff Counsel, Orlando and John A. Boggs, Asst."
"Staff Counsel, Tallahassee, for complainant."
"Andrew Baron, in pro."
"per., for respondent."
PER CURIAM.
These proceedings are before us by virtue of the Court's jurisdiction to regulate the discipline of lawyers.
Art.
"V, § 15, Fla. Const."
"Two of the cases, numbers 58,051 and 58,228, which we have already consolidated, are here on The Florida Bar's petitions for review of the referees' reports."
"Case number 58,273 is before us on the respondent's petition for review of the referee's report."
"In case number 57,041, Florida Bar staff counsel has filed the report of the referee with the Court, and neither party has sought review."
We now consolidate all four for purposes of disposing of them in one opinion.
Case No.
"57041
This case, based on a complaint in two counts, arises out of respondent's representation of two clients in separate marriage dissolution proceedings."
"The referee found that in both cases respondent collected a fee and filed the complaint for dissolution, but thereafter neglected the matter entirely."
"After the filing of grievances, respondent refunded the fees."
"The referee found that in both instances respondent violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(4), 6-101(A)(3), and 7-101(A)(2)."
"Taking into consideration the respondent's past disciplinary record, The Florida Bar v. Baron, 342 So.2d 505 (Fla. 1977), the referee recommended a public reprimand."
Case No.
"58273
The referee found that in October, 1975, respondent undertook representation of Norma G. Andrade, who had a dissolution proceeding pending and whose house had just been severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable by fire, for purposes of securing a dissolution and fire insurance recovery."
"Mrs. Andrade had seven children, five of them living with her, and was referred to respondent by the bar referral service after the Legal Aid Society declared her ineligible for its services."
"Respondent entered into an oral fee agreement with her, providing him with a twenty-five per cent share of the proceeds of a sale of the house, or a fire insurance recovery."
Respondent appeared with Mrs. Andrade at the final hearing on dissolution.
"From the testimony it became apparent that Mrs. Andrade wanted the home repaired so that she and the children could continue living there, while her husband wanted to sell the home."
"He had allowed the mortgage payments to become in arrears, and apparently thought the insurance proceeds inadequate to properly restore the house."
"The court, in granting judgment of dissolution, retained jurisdiction to determine the disposition of the marital home."
"The former husband subsequently moved for permission to sell the home, and a hearing date was set."
"Mrs. Andrade received the motion and notice of hearing, but went on vacation without leaving her vacation address with respondent because she did not think her presence would be necessary."
"At the hearing, respondent joined in the petition to allow the sale of the property."
"There is a conflict in the testimony, the referee reports, as to whether Mrs. Andrade had authorized respondent's action."
"The referee concludes that she wanted to keep the house, but that respondent acted in her better interest when he approved the sale."
The court awarded respondent a fee of $1000 for his services to Mrs. Andrade.
"Yet he filed a claim of lien for, and received from the proceeds of the sale of the house, $1500."
"*1320 The referee recommended that respondent be found guilty of joining in the approval of the sale of Mrs. Andrade's house without her consent and without notifying her and thereby violated his oath as an attorney and the integration rule, and Disciplinary Rules 7-101(A)(1), 7-101(A)(2) and 7-101(A)(3)."
"The referee found that in claiming an unauthorized fee respondent violated his oath, the integration rule, and Disciplinary Rules 7-101(A)(1), 7-101(A)(2) and 7-101(A)(3)."
The referee recommended a private reprimand and probation for not less than six months nor more than three years.
The referee gave consideration to the fact that respondent has previously been disciplined by the Court and that he supports five children and a retarded brother.
The burden is on the respondent to demonstrate that the referee's report is erroneous.
Fla.Bar Integr.Rule 11.09(3)(e).
The referee's findings of fact are presumed correct and will not be disregarded unless clearly erroneous or lacking support in evidence.
"The Florida Bar v. McCain, 361 So.2d 700 (Fla. 1978); The Florida Bar v. Hirsch, 359 So.2d 856 (Fla. 1978)."
"Applying this standard, we conclude that the referee's findings of fact must be upheld."
Case No.
"58051
The referee found that respondent, in June, 1975, undertook representation of a client who had a claim against an insurance company, and accepted a $100 partial fee in advance."
"Respondent engaged in some negotiations and then, in April, 1976, advised the client that suit would have to be filed."
"One year later, respondent informed the client that he would require an additional fee payment of $500 before filing suit."
"The client sent a check, and respondent cashed it."
"Respondent still did not initiate the lawsuit, however, and after the client complained to The Florida Bar, respondent refunded $500."
"The referee recommended that respondent be found guilty of violating his oath, the integration rule, and Disciplinary Rule 6-101(A)(3)."
We uphold the findings of fact.
"The referee recommended a public reprimand, six months of probation, and periodic case load status reports."
"The Florida Bar seeks review of this recommendation and asks, in this case as consolidated with case number 58,228, that respondent be suspended for one year with assessment of costs, and with reinstatement conditioned upon proof of rehabilitation."
Case No.
"58228
The referee found that a client whom respondent had represented in a marriage dissolution proceeding returned for representation when her former husband sought a reduction of his child support obligation."
"Depositions of both the client and the former husband were scheduled to be taken the same day, but because the client's deposition took longer than expected, the husband's deposition was not taken."
"While respondent indicated he would take the former husband's deposition, he never did."
The client filed a grievance when she was unable to get in touch with respondent for several months.
She subsequently entered into a stipulation with her former husband admitting a change in her circumstances due to her having begun gainful employment.
"When the respondent received a copy of the stipulation, he assumed that a child support reduction was a foregone conclusion and that he was discharged, and did not attend the final hearing."
"The referee found that respondent did not properly represent his client in the matter in violation of his oath, the integration rule, and Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(4), 6-101(A)(3), and 7-101(A)(2)."
We uphold the referee's findings of fact.
The referee recommended a private reprimand and six months to three years of probation.
"The Florida Bar seeks review of the recommended discipline, and recommends as discipline in this case as consolidated with case number 58,051 a one year suspension with proof of rehabilitation and taxation of costs."
"In supervising the discipline of lawyers, this Court deals more severely with *1321 cumulative misconduct than with isolated instances of misconduct."
"The Florida Bar v. Vernell, 374 So.2d 473 (Fla. 1979)."
"In view of the fact that we deal here with four separate bar discipline cases, we agree with the Bar that a more severe punishment is warranted than was recommended in any of the individual proceedings."
There was no evidence of a corrupt motive.
Respondent's problems have been those of neglect and failure to communicate.
"In those instances in which respondent neglected a legal matter, he refunded the fees paid."
The respondent is supporting five children and a mentally retarded brother.
It is our responsibility to impose the appropriate discipline.
"We suspend the respondent from the practice of law for sixty days, the suspension to commence on the fifteenth day from the date of this order."
Reinstatement shall be automatic.
"Upon reinstatement, respondent is to be placed on probation for three years, during which period he will report on the status of all his cases bimonthly to the Clerk of this Court and provide a copy of these reports to Florida Bar staff counsel as they are filed."
"We assess against respondent the costs of these proceedings, as found in the referee's reports, in the amount of $1147.69."
"SUNDBERG, C.J., and BOYD, OVERTON and McDONALD, JJ., concur."
"ALDERMAN, J., dissents with an opinion."
"ALDERMAN, Justice, dissenting."
"In view of the respondent's cumulative misconduct, including that set out in The Florida Bar v. Baron, 342 So.2d 505 (Fla. 1977), I would suspend him for one year."

"Don't mess with Mother Nature

The issues surrounding lightning protection have changed little since Benjamin Franklin famously invented the lightning rod in 1752."
"While Franklin was looking to protect ordinary buildings from fire after lightning strikes, at 21st-century base transceiver station sites, the priority — apart from the obvious safety requirement — is to safeguard the sensitive electronic equipment housed in the site's equipment building."
"The consequences of a loss are not simply related to the cost of replacing the equipment, but also to the loss of service."
"When contemplating protection against these losses, the site's transmission lines are a critical consideration, as they provide direct conductive paths from the top of the tower to the equipment below."
"It is no surprise that electrical storms are so spectacular, as they are truly high-energy events."
One-third of all recorded lightning strikes are rated between 20 and 100 kiloamps (kA).
The effects of lightning have been well-researched and documented.
It has been known to blast chunks of concrete from walls.
"Occasionally, a tower will be hit by lightning at its highest point — the antenna — which not only will “fry” the antenna but, without surge protection, can travel into the very expensive base station equipment housed in the equipment building."
Surge events are not only caused by hits to towers or antennas.
"At base transceiver station (BTS) sites, lightning strikes within a few hundred yards of a tower are just as dangerous as direct hits, as they may induce high-energy electromagnetic fields onto the feeder lines."
"The art then, is to design a system that protects the electronic equipment from a surge on the feeder lines, regardless of the source."
A properly grounded transmission system always will employ a minimum of three cable-grounding points.
"One is at the top of the main feeder line, within three feet of the top connector."
"The second is at the bottom of the tower-mounted section of the feeder line, and within three feet, but not on, the lateral bend away from the tower to the cable tray."
The third is within three feet of the entry to either the radio cabinet or equipment building.
Additional grounding points also must be added to the main vertical run of transmission line — one for each additional 200 feet of feeder cable.
"The grounding kits used for this purpose can either clip onto the cable or be held in place with clamps and screws, depending on the requirements of the installation."
"Regardless of the method used, a good electrical connection is vital; otherwise the resistance between the ground wire and the feeder may limit the protection against a strike."
"Once correctly attached to the feeder, the grounding lead usually is connected directly to the tower metalwork or to a site grounding bus bar."
Fitting a grounding kit to a feeder line leads to a protection concern of a different kind — weatherproofing the grounding system.
"It is extremely important that the raw material in the cable is not exposed to the weather, as that could cause oxidation issues."
"Further safeguarding of the sensitive electronics in the equipment room is provided by the insertion of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) protection devices close to the equipment, between the jumper cables and the feeder lines."
Such devices often are quite compact — only slightly larger than the connectors.
"Together, the transmission line grounding kits and EMP protection devices minimize the risk of equipment damage after a lightning strike."
"During normal operation, EMP devices — also referred to as surge protectors — do not influence the RF behavior of the antenna and cable systems; they activate only when there is a surge on the transmission line."
"Such devices fall into two broad categories: those that pass direct current (DC), and those that block it."
"The default choice is a DC-block device, but if power is required for tower-top components (such as boosters and amplifiers), a DC-pass device is selected."
Weatherproofing the EMP-protection devices is just as important as weatherproofing the feeder cable.
"All surge protectors that are mounted to the base of the tower, at the junctions, and at the jumper and feeder line exit and entry points should be weatherproofed."
"Having selected the appropriate forms of protection to suit the base station's configuration, designers need to consider the connections to the site's grounding point."
Every feeder run should have its own grounding.
"The grounding leads are connected to a bus bar at the base of the tower, which is connected in turn to a single ground rod, or a ground ring with multiple rods."
"The rods, which are generally 5 feet or more in length, are buried and disperse the energy into the ground."
A high-quality connection between the feeder's outer conductor and the grounding kit is a basic requirement.
"High-speed fitting allows the installer to be productive, but this needs to be achieved without loss of quality, otherwise cable lifetimes can be reduced, or work may need to be redone."
Tools are available that make the grounding job both easy and fast.
"For instance, stripping tools are designed specifically to remove the jacket material for grounding so installers aren't forced to use their knives to manually strip the cable off in the middle of the feeder run."
"This approach not only is quicker and cleaner, but it also takes the correct amount of material off without overstripping."
"Using these tools, installers don't have to worry about scratching, denting or damaging the cable."
"For the connectors and the EMP-protection devices, applying the correct torque at the fitting stage is important."
"Good mechanical connection and electrical contact are required, but they must be achieved without overtightening."
Using a torque wrench will achieve the desired result.
"Although lightning strikes at BTS sites always will occur, the combination of careful design, appropriate protection devices, good tooling and expert installation will minimize the risks."
Proper grounding and surge protection are small investments compared to the system replacement cost following a lightning strike.
"When lightning does hit a tower, everything above the lightning protector usually will be “smoked” and replaced, but the big expensive racks of equipment down in the BTS will be protected."
Matt Gauvin is the area product manager for Transmission Lines North America at Radio Frequency Systems.
"Q:

How to optimally combine multiple axios responses

I am working with a React app."
I have to create 2 objects using responses from 3 different APIs.
"For example: 

DataObject1 will be created using API1 and API2 
DataObject2 will be created using API1, API2, and API3

So, I am thinking about what would be the most optimal way of doing this by making sure 1 call each API only once."
"I was thinking this:
const requestOne = axios.get(API1);
const requestTwo = axios.get(API2);
const requestThree = axios.get(API3);

axios.all([requestOne, requestTwo, requestThree]).then(axios.spread((...responses) => {
  const dataObject1 = createDataObject1(responses[0], responses[1]);
  const dataObject2 = createDataObject2(responses[0], responses[1], responses[2]);
  // use/access the results 
})).catch(errors => {
  // react on errors.
})"
"const createDataObject1 = (response1, response2) => { //Combine required data and return dataObject1 }
const createDataObject2 = (response1, response2, response3) => { //Combine required data and return dataObject2 }

Is there a better way of doing this?"
"A:

Looks fine."
"You can change this
axios.all([requestOne, requestTwo, requestThree]).then(axios.spread((...responses) => {
  const dataObject1 = createDataObject1(responses[0], responses[1]);
  const dataObject 2 = createDataObject2(responses[0], responses[1], responses[2]);
  // use/access the results 
})).catch(errors => {
  // react on errors.
})"
"to
axios.all([requestOne, requestTwo, requestThree]).then(axios(response) => {
  const dataObject1 = createDataObject1(responses[0], responses[1]);
  const dataObject 2 = createDataObject2(responses[0], responses[1], responses[2]);
  // use/access the results 
}).catch(errors => {
  // react on errors.
})"
because spreading and resting is redundant.
"If you don't want to use them like responses[0], responses[1], etc then you can use:
axios.all([requestOne, requestTwo, requestThree]).then(axios.spread((response1, response2, response3) => {
  const dataObject1 = createDataObject1(response1, response2);
  const dataObject 2 = createDataObject2(response1, response2,response3);
  // use/access the results 
})).catch(errors => {
  // react on errors.
})"

"PS3 Firmware 3.30 has just been released by Sony, but at the moment the really cool new features aren’t accessible."
The only changes you can really see are the ones to the SCEA Terms of Service/User Agreement/Privacy Policy and the PS3 Trophy System.
"The other two features, 3D stereoscopic gaming support and VAIO remote play, aren’t accessible yet."
With the arrival of Sony’s PS3 firmware 3.30 comes an update to the SCEA Terms of Service and User Agreement and Privacy Policy for the PlayStation Network.
"Of course, if you have a PlayStation account, you received an email at the account you registered with letting you know all this and asking you to review the changes."
"The new terms state that Sony can automatically update or upgrade your system without telling you or your permission, and that these new updates may change your system and its functions."
Sounds like this is directed at people who are upset PS3s can’t run Linux anymore.
The Trophy System enhancements just make it easier to sort through the trophies you’ve earned so far.
"You can sort by game name and date, by when you earned your most recent trophies and by trophy information like name or grade."
It also makes it easier to sort and compare trophies when looking at them and your friends’.
Firmware 3.30 also takes the first steps towards making the PS3 a 3D console.
It prepares the console for 3D stereoscopic gaming and support.
"This means your PS3s will be compatible with any 3D TVs, like the forthcoming 3D Sony Bravia."
"You’ll need 3D PS3 games of course as well, of which there are none at the moment."
"Finally, Andriasang points out an interesting note at the Japanese PlayStation 3 firmware update page concerning firmware 3.30."
The page there states that Sony VAIO PCs will be able to registered as a device under the Remote Play Settings.
The page also states that the Japanese VAIO website will eventually offer instructions on how to enable the computers for Remote Play.
This means all PS3s with firmware 3.30 have this capability waiting inside for the right moment.

""White Hispanics""... unite!"
I guess there was that one goy that pointed a gun at some rioting Africans.
"Then
he got fined $250,000 or something."
"So yeah, we probably have to work
on continuing to use the internet to bring down the (((anti-white)))
institutions, culture and media outlets that Jews have created before
getting too crazy about anything."
The case of George Zimmerman shows that any white/Spanish or even brown man will be expected to let himself be beaten to death.
"If
Hillary wins and continues trying to diversify white privilege/""Nazis"" out of
existence for the anti-white Jewish Zionists and supremacists that own
her... well, I'm not sure what happens."
"One could look at what already
happened."
"No one really formed militias and rallied to Zimmerman when
he was targeted by the most powerful people and media outlet in the
country, although he did get some financial help."
"Anyway, it all leaves
a history."
"So ""Hispanics"" should take note that they're White and if
Hillary is a continuation of Obama/""diversity"", then the expectation will be that
they don't defend their neighborhoods and let some African criminal beat
them to death for being a ""white Hispanic."""
That's historical fact now.
"So check your ethnic identities based on what has actually occurred and
how you're targeted by corrupt shabbos goyim like Obama/Hillary... Hispanics are
White/Spanish."
Hope more and more of them realize their actual ethnic interests just like many Brexit folks realized their own ethnic interests as the process of immigration and diversity in (((economic))) unions progressively continues.
"(And gets worse and worse, under the Hillary/Merkel model of globalism...) ﻿"

Instruction in teaching and teaching opportunities for residents in US dermatology programs: Results of a national survey.
Dermatology residents routinely teach junior co-residents and medical students.
"Despite the importance of teaching skills for a successful academic career, no formal teaching instruction programs for dermatology residents have been described to our knowledge, and the extent of teaching opportunities for dermatology residents is unknown."
We sought to describe the range of teaching opportunities and instruction available to dermatology residents and to assess the need for additional teaching training from the perspective of dermatology residency program directors nationwide.
A questionnaire was administered to 113 US dermatology residency program directors or their designees.
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze questionnaire item responses.
The response rate was 55% (62/113).
"All program directors reported that their residents teach; 59% (33/56) reported offering trainees teaching instruction; 11% (7/62) of programs offered a short-term series of formal sessions on teaching; and 7% (4/62) offered ongoing, longitudinal training."
"Most program directors (74%, 40/54) believed that their residents would benefit from more teaching instruction."
Response rate and responder bias are potential limitations.
"Dermatology residents teach in a broad range of settings, over half receive some teaching instruction, and most dermatology residency program directors perceive a need for additional training for residents as teachers."

"Introduction {#sec1-ijerph-16-00926}
===============

In China, the primary health care (PHC) system set up in the 1950s has contributed to a dramatic reduction in maternal and infant mortality, a significant improvement in general population health and the development of the Declaration of Alma-Ata in 1978 \[[@B1-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"However, the market economic reform, which began in 1978, undermined the previously established PHC system \[[@B2-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Instead, a hospital-centered fragmented delivery system was developed where health facilities at different levels were encouraged to self-finance through user charges and price mark-ups on medications and procedures."
"These developments incentivized high technology and low interinstitutional referral, with escalating medical costs, low affordability, public dissatisfaction and a significant disparity between urban and rural areas \[[@B3-ijerph-16-00926],[@B4-ijerph-16-00926],[@B5-ijerph-16-00926],[@B6-ijerph-16-00926],[@B7-ijerph-16-00926],[@B8-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"To address these issues, China launched a national health reform in 2009 with the aim of providing its citizens with essential public health and basic medical services that are safe, effective, accessible and affordable through a strong PHC based health system \[[@B9-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Guided by this national strategy, China has made a significant investment in health infrastructure at the PHC level and made significant progress in strengthening the primary care workforce."
"Combined with the impact of expanding social health insurance coverage, that provides a basic public health service package and an essential medicines program, China has witnessed a more equitable access to health care and greater affordability \[[@B1-ijerph-16-00926],[@B4-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"To deepen the health reform efforts, China is currently reshaping its tiered health care delivery system in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework on Integrated People-Centered Health Services \[[@B10-ijerph-16-00926]\], which calls for health services to be organized around the health needs and preferences of individuals and requires active patient engagement in the care-seeking process \[[@B11-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
There is growing interest in measuring PHC performance from a patient perspective in order to assess the Chinese reform effectiveness.
"However, the survey instruments and implementation approaches used vary significantly between studies."
Patient experience has been studied extensively in developed countries.
It is recognized as one of the pillars of health care quality alongside clinical effectiveness and patient safety \[[@B12-ijerph-16-00926]\].
Patient experience during the service delivery process is also a major determinant of trust in and satisfaction with PHC \[[@B13-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"Patients are the best evaluators of key aspects of PHC, such as interpersonal communication, shared decision-making, relational continuity, respect, privacy and advocacy \[[@B14-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"With a positive care experience, patients are more likely to adhere to the recommended prevention methods and treatments, which subsequently results in better clinical and health outcomes \[[@B12-ijerph-16-00926],[@B15-ijerph-16-00926],[@B16-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Positive patient experience is also associated with a reduced use of health care resources and lower health care costs \[[@B17-ijerph-16-00926],[@B18-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"As an important indicator in health care performance evaluation, patient experience is included in quality improvement programs in developed countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Canada and the United States of America (USA) \[[@B19-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Some of the widely used patient experience instruments in developed countries include the Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS) \[[@B20-ijerph-16-00926]\]; the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) \[[@B21-ijerph-16-00926],[@B22-ijerph-16-00926]\]; the World Health Organization Health System Responsiveness Survey \[[@B23-ijerph-16-00926]\]; and the Primary Care Assessment Tools (PCAT) \[[@B24-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
Several lessons have been learned from the development and application of these instruments.
"First, PHC domains and items should be selected based on health system features and population preferences in a specific context."
"For example, to adapt PCAS from the USA to the UK, several modifications were made, including rewording some questions, removing questions that are not relevant in the UK and adding domains relating to patient priorities in the UK \[[@B25-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Second, the wording of item response scales should reflect the response tendency of the local population."
"For example, for Canadians, Likert response scales function best and agreement scales are least appreciated \[[@B26-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Third, survey administration methods may influence the measurement error."
"For example, telephone respondents tend to give more positive responses than mail respondents \[[@B27-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"These lessons provide practical information for patient survey design and implementation in developing countries, including China, where there is growing interest in measuring PHC performance from a user perspective."
"This literature review aims to summarize the progress and issues with patient evaluation studies of PHC in China in relation to three aspects: the choice of domains and items, the choice of response scales, and survey administration methods."
The results will lay a solid foundation for further development of patient experience measurement methods in China.

"Methods {#sec2-ijerph-16-00926}
==========

2.1."
"Databases and Search Terms {#sec2dot1-ijerph-16-00926}
-------------------------------

PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched to identify relevant articles."
The PubMed and CNKI searches were conducted in February 2018.
"The following key search terms and their synonyms were used: China, primary health care, primary care, community health, township health center, village clinic, assessment, evaluation, measurement and patient."
An iterative approach was used to identify search terms.
"The final search strategy can be found in [Supplement 1](#app1-ijerph-16-00926){ref-type=""app""}."
Only the publications in English and Chinese were retained.
No time limit was imposed.
2.2.
"Selection of Studies for Inclusion {#sec2dot2-ijerph-16-00926}
---------------------------------------

A total of 169 articles in English and 302 articles in Chinese were identified."
The following inclusion criteria were used: (1) the study is part of original research in China; (2) the study design is a patient survey; (3) the study reports the information on the measurement and administration of patient surveys.
The screening process was conducted by one researcher.
"After screening the titles and abstracts, 37 articles in English and 92 articles in Chinese were included for full-text review."
"After full-text review, nine English and 29 Chinese articles were excluded because they did not report any information on measurement and survey administration."
This resulted in a total of 28 articles in English and 63 articles in Chinese that were included in the final analysis.
"Among them, nine articles include two sub-studies each."
One article includes three sub-studies.
"Therefore, 102 studies were included in the current analysis."
"A total of 81 studies focus on community health centers, 17 studies - on township health centers and four studies---on village clinics."
"The description of each study is provided in [Supplement 2 and Supplement 3](#app1-ijerph-16-00926){ref-type=""app""}."
2.3.
"Data Extraction and Analysis {#sec2dot3-ijerph-16-00926}
---------------------------------

A data extraction form in Excel was developed to collect the following information: author, published date, the year when the study was conducted, study setting, domains measuring PHC, items measuring PHC, response options and survey administration methods."
"Due to the variations in measurements and administration methods between studies, a descriptive reporting approach was used."
3.
"Results {#sec3-ijerph-16-00926}
==========

A total of 102 studies were included for data analysis."
More than 80% (84) of the studies were published after 2009 when China launched its national health reform.
Most studies were conducted in eastern (more developed) provinces in China.
"Guangdong (29), Shanghai (9) and Shandong (8) contributed to nearly half of the studies."
3.1.
"Patient Experience Measurements Adapted from Other Instruments {#sec3dot1-ijerph-16-00926}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The measurements adapted from the instruments developed in other countries were used in over one-third (37 of 102) of the studies ([Table 1](#ijerph-16-00926-t001){ref-type=""table""})."
The PCAT and the WHO Health System Responsiveness Survey were the two instruments most often used in China.
"The original PCAT developed by Barbara Starfield at the Johns Hopkins Primary Care Policy Center is the most widely used instrument in China, including Guangdong \[[@B28-ijerph-16-00926],[@B29-ijerph-16-00926],[@B30-ijerph-16-00926],[@B31-ijerph-16-00926],[@B32-ijerph-16-00926],[@B33-ijerph-16-00926],[@B34-ijerph-16-00926],[@B35-ijerph-16-00926],[@B36-ijerph-16-00926],[@B37-ijerph-16-00926],[@B38-ijerph-16-00926]\], Shanghai \[[@B28-ijerph-16-00926],[@B33-ijerph-16-00926],[@B39-ijerph-16-00926]\], Hunan \[[@B40-ijerph-16-00926]\] and Tibet \[[@B41-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"The original English PCAT adult version includes seven domains: First Contact (accessibility and utilization), Continuity, Coordination (information and referral systems), Comprehensiveness (service availability and service provided), Community Orientation, Family Centeredness and Cultural Competency."
"The response options are a four-point Likert-type response scale where 1 = definitely not, 2 = probably not, 3 = probably, 4 = definitely and an additional option 9 = not sure/do not know \[[@B24-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
There are various Chinese versions of PCAT.
"Among 18 PCAT studies, 12 included all seven domains \[[@B29-ijerph-16-00926],[@B33-ijerph-16-00926],[@B34-ijerph-16-00926],[@B35-ijerph-16-00926],[@B36-ijerph-16-00926],[@B37-ijerph-16-00926],[@B38-ijerph-16-00926],[@B41-ijerph-16-00926]\] and the remaining six used a subset \[[@B28-ijerph-16-00926],[@B30-ijerph-16-00926],[@B32-ijerph-16-00926],[@B39-ijerph-16-00926],[@B40-ijerph-16-00926],[@B42-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"For example, Community Orientation and Family Centeredness were not included in four studies \[[@B28-ijerph-16-00926],[@B30-ijerph-16-00926],[@B39-ijerph-16-00926],[@B42-ijerph-16-00926]\] and Cultural Competency was not included in six studies \[[@B28-ijerph-16-00926],[@B30-ijerph-16-00926],[@B32-ijerph-16-00926],[@B39-ijerph-16-00926],[@B40-ijerph-16-00926],[@B42-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
Most studies followed the original four-point Likert-type response scale with the same wording but one study changed the wording of the response scale to 1 = never; 2 = sometimes; 3 = often; and 4 = always \[[@B30-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"All PCAT studies included four of the seven domains (First Contact, Continuity, Coordination and Comprehensiveness), which correspond to Starfield's ""core domains"" \[[@B24-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Although Comprehensiveness was included in all studies, the items in each study varied \[[@B24-ijerph-16-00926],[@B40-ijerph-16-00926],[@B43-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"The Health System Responsiveness Survey was developed by the WHO to measure the users' interaction with health services in eight domains: Dignity, Autonomy, Confidentiality, Communication, Prompt Attention, Quality of Basic Amenities, Social Support and Choice of health care providers."
Questions measuring health system responsiveness cover ambulatory (22 items) and inpatient (11 items) visits.
"All questions used similarly ordered four-point (always, usually, sometimes, never) or five-point (mainly: very good, good, moderate, bad, very bad) Likert response options \[[@B23-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Among the 12 studies using this survey in China, only six studies included all eight domains \[[@B44-ijerph-16-00926],[@B45-ijerph-16-00926],[@B46-ijerph-16-00926],[@B47-ijerph-16-00926],[@B48-ijerph-16-00926],[@B49-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Social Support was not included in five studies \[[@B50-ijerph-16-00926],[@B51-ijerph-16-00926],[@B52-ijerph-16-00926],[@B53-ijerph-16-00926],[@B54-ijerph-16-00926]\], Quality of Basic Amenities was not included in three studies \[[@B50-ijerph-16-00926],[@B54-ijerph-16-00926],[@B55-ijerph-16-00926]\] and Choice of Providers was not included in three studies \[[@B50-ijerph-16-00926],[@B51-ijerph-16-00926],[@B54-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Most studies used the response scale suggested by the WHO, with just two studies not doing so \[[@B48-ijerph-16-00926],[@B49-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"However, no studies reported the psychometric properties of measurements."

"Patient Experience Measurements Developed by Authors Themselves {#sec3dot2-ijerph-16-00926}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Two-thirds (65 of 102) of the studies used measurements developed by the authors themselves."
Most did not report the development process for these measurements.
"The frequency of PHC aspects, number of items and response options included in these measurements are summarized in [Table 2](#ijerph-16-00926-t002){ref-type=""table""} and [Table 3](#ijerph-16-00926-t003){ref-type=""table""}."
More than 40 care aspects were evaluated in the 65 studies.
"The care aspects most frequently evaluated, in decreasing order, were: service attitude of health professionals (92%); medical cost (82%); physical environment (78%); technical skill of health professionals (68%); and medical equipment (66%)."
Convenience and waiting times were evaluated in more than 50% of the studies.
"There are fewer studies that include interpersonal care aspects, such as privacy protection (25%), respect (12%), shared decision making (9%) and the doctor's listening skills and patience (6%)."
"The number of items reported in the studies ranged from 3 to 35, with the majority ranging from 5 to 15."
"A five-point-Likert response scale was used most often (50 out of 65) although some studies used three, four or six response options."
The wording of five-point response options also varied.
"For example, some studies used ""always, usually, sometimes, occasionally, never"" or ""completely agree, agree, not sure, disagree, completely disagree""."
"Other studies used ""very good, good, neutral, bad, very bad"" or ""very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied""."
"Depending on the types of questions (declarative or evaluative) measuring patient perception, further research could explore appropriate evaluative language and response scales among Chinese people."
"Only six out of the 65 studies reported the psychometric properties of measurements \[[@B56-ijerph-16-00926],[@B57-ijerph-16-00926],[@B58-ijerph-16-00926],[@B59-ijerph-16-00926],[@B60-ijerph-16-00926],[@B61-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Four studies reported good validity and reliability based on the results of Cronbach's α and principle component analyses \[[@B56-ijerph-16-00926],[@B57-ijerph-16-00926],[@B58-ijerph-16-00926],[@B61-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
One study briefly reported good reliability and unacceptable validity without reporting any detail about data analysis \[[@B59-ijerph-16-00926]\].
One study only tested face and content validity through a pilot study with 30 respondents \[[@B60-ijerph-16-00926]\].
3.3.
"Survey Implementation Approach {#sec3dot3-ijerph-16-00926}
-----------------------------------

The on-site survey was used by 99 studies while only three out of the 102 studies used a telephone survey."
"For the location of the on-site survey, the exit of primary care institutions is the most common place and was used by 63% of the studies."
"For the administration of the on-site survey, a face-to-face interview was reported by 29 studies and self-administration was reported by 14 studies, while this information was missing in the remaining 56 studies ([Table 4](#ijerph-16-00926-t004){ref-type=""table""})."

"Discussion {#sec4-ijerph-16-00926}
=============

Based on our previous research, we captured two major points relating to patient evaluation studies of PHC in China: the inconsistency of survey instruments and implementation approaches."
"Through a thorough discussion with PHC researchers in China and Canada, we agreed that a narrative review was an efficient approach to produce an overall picture about what measurements have been used and how they have been implemented among the patient evaluation studies of PHC in China."
"The advantage of this approach is that it offers breadth of literature coverage and the flexibility to deal with evolving knowledge and concepts, without requiring more time and resources to prepare and update the records as in a systematic review \[[@B62-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"To include as many relevant publications as possible, we identified search terms in Chinese and English using a brainstorming technique within our research team, and developed the search strategy through an iterative approach (trying different wording of search terms and different combinations)."
"Finally, we applied our search strategy in both PubMed and CNKI, which are the main databases that include publications about Chinese health services in English and Chinese, respectively."
"Although there is a small possibility that some relevant publications were missed in our search, we are confident that the results portray a comprehensive picture of patient evaluation studies of PHC in China."
"Through the analysis of 102 patient evaluation studies of PHC in China, we found that most studies used author-developed instruments with commonly used five-point Likert response options and many used Chinese translations of the instruments developed in other countries."
"Furthermore, most author-developed instruments measure the structural dimensions of PHC, and most measures focus on satisfaction to rate subjective perception rather than on care experience to report objective problems."
4.1.
"Issues of Measurements Adapted from Other Countries {#sec4dot1-ijerph-16-00926}
--------------------------------------------------------

The studies included in our review used a similar approach to adapting instruments but the results varied even in the same context."
This calls for national collaboration to address these issues.
"For example, three studies reported the adaptation process and validation results of PCAT in China \[[@B40-ijerph-16-00926],[@B43-ijerph-16-00926],[@B63-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
Each used the following process: forward--backward translation; consensus by an expert panel to identify the appropriateness of items and domains; and a pilot test to improve item wording.
"However, the three Chinese versions vary, particularly in item wording."
"Even for the same item in the original PCAT, there were variations in some of the Chinese translations."
These variations lead to varied findings of the psychometric properties of this instrument.
"For example, a validation study in Guangdong confirmed the construct factors embedded in the original PCAT \[[@B63-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"However, another study in the same province using the same validation technique suggests that some domains should be removed, including Family Centeredness, Community Orientation and Cultural Competence as well as two items measuring First Contact and Coordination \[[@B43-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
The psychometric analysis in the province of Hunan also showed that the factor constructs did not fit well with the underlying theoretical constructs in the original PCAT \[[@B40-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"For each domain of primary care, First Contact fails to meet optimal psychometric standards of internal consistency in two studies in China."
"These studies found that Cronbach's α was only 0.38 \[[@B43-ijerph-16-00926]\] and 0.48 \[[@B40-ijerph-16-00926]\] for First Contact-Utilization, respectively."
"The internal consistency of Comprehensiveness also showed inconsistent results between different studies \[[@B40-ijerph-16-00926],[@B43-ijerph-16-00926],[@B63-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"The principles of First Contact, Continuity, Coordination and Comprehensiveness that are included in PCAT are recognized and shared internationally."
"However, service delivery and financing systems vary significantly between countries."
The tools developed in one context may not be appropriate in another.
"For the same domain of primary care, the patients in different countries may have a different understanding and expectations."
"For example, First Contact items from the original PCAT may not be appropriate in countries with a different health system organization and patient expectations."
"Making appointments in advance and gatekeeping by primary care workers may not be applicable in some countries \[[@B64-ijerph-16-00926],[@B65-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Geographical accessibility is a major constraint for local people to get to health care services in rural and remote areas, but it was not addressed in the original PCAT."
Similar issues are likely to pertain to Comprehensiveness and Coordination with specialists.
4.2.
"Issues of Measurements Developed by Authors {#sec4dot2-ijerph-16-00926}
------------------------------------------------

Most author-developed measures focus on the structural dimensions of PHC, such as the physical environment, medical equipment and convenience (distance from home to facility)."
The interest in predominantly evaluating the structural dimensions is based on the assumption that adequately trained doctors and nurses with access to infrastructure (such as well-equipped facilities and medicines) will be sufficient for guaranteeing adequate quality \[[@B66-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"However, emerging evidence suggests that this understanding may be incorrect."
"For example, a cross-sectional study of 4,300 facilities in eight countries demonstrated that the structural input characteristics (amenities, equipment and medications) of health facilities are poorly correlated with the provision of evidence-based care (providers' adherence to evidence-based care guidelines) \[[@B67-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Furthermore, if user perceptions in patient surveys closely reflect the observable infrastructural facilities, questions related to these perceptions would not add to what could be learned from direct observation using facility surveys \[[@B68-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
These observations highlight the inappropriateness of evaluating the structural aspects of PHC from a user perspective.
"Although the technical skills of doctors are also often evaluated by patients in China, there is a weak correlation between the patient-perceived technical quality of care and technical quality measures extracted from medical records \[[@B69-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"However, strong correlations were identified between the patient-perceived technical quality and their assessment of doctors' interpersonal communication skills and trustworthiness \[[@B69-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
Few patients have sufficient knowledge about their own illness or about possible treatment options to make an informed judgement about the technical quality of care \[[@B70-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"When patients are asked about technical quality, they are more likely to make judgements based on the care aspects that they feel they are able to judge."
Experts claim that clinician reports and medical chart reviews are better approaches to evaluating technical quality of care \[[@B71-ijerph-16-00926]\].
4.3.
"Satisfaction and Care Experience {#sec4dot3-ijerph-16-00926}
-------------------------------------

Most patient survey measures of PHC in China focus on satisfaction to rate subjective perception rather than on patients' care experience to report objective problems."
"In addition, there is increasing interest in patient satisfaction studies in hospital settings in China \[[@B71-ijerph-16-00926],[@B72-ijerph-16-00926],[@B73-ijerph-16-00926],[@B74-ijerph-16-00926],[@B75-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"In developed countries, the rising consumerism in the 1970s and 1980s has led to an increased emphasis on patient perspectives \[[@B76-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"The motivation for early patient surveys was to keep patients ""happy"" or ""satisfied"" rather than ask about what did or did not happen."
"Although extensive studies were conducted on patient satisfaction assessment, many of them did not explicitly elicit quality information from patients."
"Since the 1990s, it became clear that as a tool for quality improvement, the patient satisfaction survey was neither very sensitive nor very useful \[[@B76-ijerph-16-00926],[@B77-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
There is agreement that the definitive conceptualization of satisfaction with health care has still not been achieved and that understanding the process by which a patient becomes satisfied or dissatisfied remains unanswered \[[@B78-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"Subsequently, patient surveys shifted towards reporting patient-reported care experience, which is now considered to provide more specific information to guide quality improvement compared to satisfaction measures \[[@B19-ijerph-16-00926],[@B79-ijerph-16-00926],[@B80-ijerph-16-00926],[@B81-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"The evolution of patient surveys from assessing satisfaction to focusing on care experience in developed countries suggests that apart from the increasing interest in patient satisfaction, patient care experience studies should also gain more attention in China."
4.4.
"Survey Implementation {#sec4dot4-ijerph-16-00926}
--------------------------

The patient exit survey in primary care institutions is the most commonly used survey implementation method in China."
The popularity of the patient exit survey is due to its operational efficiency as it is more convenient to identify patients at clinics than through population-based surveys \[[@B82-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"However, there are also arguments about the patient exit surveys that respondents in many cases do not openly report about negative experiences when they are within the premises of health facilities \[[@B68-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
Another potential problem relates to the sampling approach.
"In almost all studies using the patient exit survey, the interviewer selected the next patient exiting the clinic after completing an interview."
"However, recent evidence shows that this sampling method yields a biased sample as patients who spend a longer time with the clinician are overrepresented."
"This bias can be removed by selecting the next patient who enters rather than exits the consultation room, which is operationally more efficient than alternative methods (systematic and simple random sampling) in most PHC settings \[[@B82-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"In addition, most studies included in this review did not report clear information on sampling frames and patient recruitment procedures."
The two most popular survey administration methods in patient exit surveys in China are: face-to-face verbal interviews using paper and pencil; and the traditional paper and self-administration method involving handing paper questionnaires to people in person and asking them to complete them by hand and return them to the researcher.
Some studies used both methods.
Face-to-face interviews have the advantage of a high response rate and low cognitive burden for the respondents although this method leads to a high social desirability bias and interviewer bias \[[@B83-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"The visual and written method of self-administration has the advantage of a low social desirability bias and high willingness to disclose sensitive information but places high cognitive burden on respondents, especially the demand for literacy \[[@B83-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"Besides, the characteristics of these different survey administration modes may also influence participants' response to the instruments, which needs to be examined further in the context of China."

"Conclusions and Practice Implication {#sec5-ijerph-16-00926}
=======================================

The patient experience measurements and survey implementation approaches are two major issues in patient evaluation studies of PHC in China."
"Most studies evaluate the structural dimensions of PHC, of which patients are not the best evaluators."
Various wordings and categories of response options are used but it is unclear which one is optimal among Chinese people.
Many studies do not report a detailed sampling approach or patient recruitment procedures and the effect of different survey administration methods on participants' responses is unclear.
The lack of consistency in survey instruments and administration methods indicates that more coordinated efforts are needed in order to develop valid instruments to evaluate patient perceptions of PHC performance in China.
This study is only the first step to map out the current situation and propose future direction towards developing Chinese value-based patient experience measurements.
"As a starting point, explicit information about what matters most to patients in China should be investigated."
Patient experience measurements should reflect patients' needs and preferences in their cultural and health system contexts.
Patient preferences or priorities have been studied extensively in Europe and North America.
"These efforts consistently demonstrate that in addition to clinical competency or technical quality, interpersonal care aspects, such as interpersonal communication, shared decision-making, respectfulness and relational continuity, are also very important for patients \[[@B84-ijerph-16-00926],[@B85-ijerph-16-00926],[@B86-ijerph-16-00926],[@B87-ijerph-16-00926],[@B88-ijerph-16-00926],[@B89-ijerph-16-00926],[@B90-ijerph-16-00926],[@B91-ijerph-16-00926]\]."
"However, these health care aspects, their operational definitions and subsequent measures have all been developed in western countries with PHC-based health systems, which may not be applicable in other countries."
"Foundational work is needed to identify patient priorities in China through a strong collaboration among different stakeholders, especially with patients, caregivers and family members."
"This work could be performed through qualitative research using narrative-based analysis, followed by quantitative research using a discrete choice experiment."
This work would result in consensus on which care aspects of PHC could be measured by patients.
"Subsequently, the operational definitions and optimal response scales should be explored and identified."
"For each PHC care aspect prioritized by patients, we need to capture the measurable terms or phrases that they use when reporting their care experience."
"We also need to capture the evaluative language and categories that they use when they make judgement of ""good"" or ""bad"" health care."
"This type of work could generate the elements included in each PHC care aspect and the optimal response scale among Chinese patients, which will guide the selection of items and survey development."
"Based on these achievements, a research agenda of developing patient experience measurements could be envisioned."
"In general, this includes setting up a research team, selecting the domains and items, consensus process around finalizing the initial survey, pilot testing and refinement, examination of psychometric properties and knowledge translation."
"At the same time, a standardized survey implementation strategy could be developed, including determining the sample size for each institution, outlining the sampling approach, data collection approach, data entry and management, data analysis format and guidelines on data reporting."
"As China is moving towards building a people-centered integrated health system, measuring patient experience is an important approach to better understand patients' needs and preferences and to ensure that people-centered care is delivered."
Action plans are needed in order to promote the development of a patient experience measurement and the application of patient experience information.
"First, a national patient experience measurement strategy could be developed, which might be incorporated into the functions of the National Medical Service Management Center."
"This national strategy would aim to coordinate all efforts to measure patient experience, which would allow the government and health care providers to produce compelling data on which decisions can be based."
The UK and the USA are world leaders in this field.
"Supervised by Care Quality Commission (CQC), England's health care regulator, national patient experience surveys are conducted annually since 1998 through the National Health Service's (NHS) Patient Survey Program."
"In the USA, patient experience surveys are mainly conducted through the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program, which was established in 1995 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the government agency responsible for health care quality and research."
"Recently, Canada has also initiated the process of developing a federal and provincial strategy for patient experience measurement."
"Similar work could be conducted in China through strong collaboration between health authorities, care providers and researchers, while considering the experiences from the above-mentioned countries."
"Second, more clarity is required around what information health authorities and health care providers need from patient experience surveys, including the format and how this information will be used by them in health policy making and quality improvement."
International experiences have shown that managers and clinicians often struggle to link patient experience data to concrete transformations that could lead to an improved care experience \[[@B92-ijerph-16-00926]\].
These observations highlight the importance of involving local health authorities and health care providers in the development and implementation of patient experience surveys.
"Furthermore, exemplary primary care institutions with high patient experience performance should be selected as a benchmark in China."
"However, the link between organizational structure, management activities and patient experience performance is understudied."
Further studies from leadership and change management perspectives at the health care organization level may deepen our understanding.
"Third, an effective public reporting program may also be established in order to inform patients of the care experience performance of different providers to guide their health care seeking behavior."
"Recognizing the value of transparency and accountability, publicly released performance information is not only viewed as a fundamental patient right but is also essential for improving the functioning of health care markets."
There is evidence that consumers would use reports to support their decision making if the information was better designed and more relevant \[[@B93-ijerph-16-00926]\].
"As China is expanding the family doctor contract service model, which aims to build a gatekeeper role of primary care clinics based on a long-term therapeutic relationship between family doctors and patients, publicly released performance information on family doctors may guide patients' choice of their family doctor and facilitate the building of a longitudinal relationship."
"Based on the lessons learned from public reporting programs in other countries, such as low patient awareness of the existence of public reports, sub-optimal patient engagement in report development, information complexity and patients' difficulty in processing numbers and abstract ideas, China could develop some innovative public reporting programs to target and deliver reports to Chinese patients."

During the War of the Ring, on March 9, 3019, Prince Imrahil led a company of Swan Knights and 700 men at arms to Minas Tirith to help defend the City."
Prince Imrahil led the group that rode to the aid of Faramir and the rear-guard who were retreating from Osgiliath when the forces of Sauron overran the Pelennor Fields on March 13.
"Gandalf rode with them, and the Winged Nazgûl fled before him."
The Knights of Dol Amroth rescued Faramir from the Southrons.
"Faramir was poisoned, and Imrahil carried his nephew back to the City on his horse."
"Gandalf then took command of the besieged city, and Prince Imrahil assisted him because Denethor in his madness retreated to the White Tower with his dying son, and forgot about the city."
"Éomer and his Riders were outnumbered, but Imrahil then rode into battle and came to their aid."
"Shortly after, Aragorn arrived in the black ships of the Corsairs and the tide of the battle was turned."
"After the Pelennor fields had been cleared, Aragorn, Éomer and Imrahil rode to the Gate of Minas Tirith."
"Imrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King, but he agreed that it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city because Imrahil knew his brother-in-law Denethor was strong-willed and proud."
"When Imrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir was dying, he suggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the Kings of old were great healers."
"Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the City until Faramir awoke, in effect granting Imrahil the position of Steward."
"During the debate of the Captains of the West, Gandalf proposed that they march to the Black Gate to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo the Ring-bearer."
"Imrahil said that he would follow his liege Aragorn, but since Minas Tirith was under his command the Prince advised that some should remain to defend the City."
"In the end it was decided that an army of 7,000 would ride forth."
"Imrahil laughed and said:

""Surely this is the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the Black Land!"
"So might a child threaten a mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow!"""
"(The Return of the King: ""The Last Debate"")

The Host of the West left Minas Tirith on March 18."

"Sisters from the Bangalore province currently minister in the following states: Andra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharastra, Mangalore, and Tamil Nadu."
"The Province celebrates May 31st, the Feast of Our Lady of the Visitation, as its Patronal Feast."
"Green Living

With everything from a community garden with reserved plots to an herb garden for all to enjoy, as well as solar panels, LED lighting and electric vehicle charging stations, green living is easy at Stanford West Apartments."
"The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for inspecting electrical continuity of a circuit board, for example, having a fine wiring pattern."
The present invention also relates to a jig for use in such an inspection.
"As a system for inspecting a circuit board, there have been known a pin-contact system and a non-contact system."
As shown in FIG.
"1, the pin-contact system is configured to inspect electrical continuity between both ends of a conductive pattern as an inspection object by bringing two pin probes directly into contact with the ends, respectively, and applying a current to one of the pin probes so as to determine a resistance value of the conductive pattern from a detected voltage at the other pin probe."
This pin-contact system has an advantage of a high signal-to-noise (SN) ratio because of the pin probes contacted directly with the conductive pattern.
"On the other hand, in case of inspecting a fine-pitch board, it is fundamentally difficult to set up the pin probes only to a conductive pattern as an inspection object, and it is increasingly hard to secure an adequate positioning for bringing the pin probes into contact with the aimed pattern."
"Due to the necessity for keeping in the contact state, it is also difficult to maintain the initial accuracy of the pin probes themselves, resulting in undesirably increased running cost arising from replacements of the pin probes."
As shown in FIG.
"2, the other non-contact/contact combined system is configured to apply an inspection signal including an alternating current (AC) component with making one pin probe contact directly with one end of a conductive pattern as an inspection object (or through a capacitive coupling in a non-contact manner) and detect the inspection signal through a capacitive coupling at the other end."
The non-contact/contact combined system allows at least one of the pin probes not to be contacted with a pattern wire or the conductive pattern.
"This provides a relatively wide acceptable range of positioning accuracy for the pin probe, which makes it possible to use the pin probe commonly for a plurality of pattern wires, and thereby to reduce the number of pin probes."
"Furthermore, since the pin prove is free from any wear, the combined system is effective for a board with a fine wiring pattern."
"However, the non-contact/contact combined system has a small value of coupling capacitance and a high impedance (from several Mxcexa9 to several Gxcexa9)."
"Thus, this system cannot detect any defective portion having a resistance ranging from about 10xcexa9 to about 100xcexa9."
"As a result, due to the property including high impedance despite having many advantages, the non-contact/contact combined system has been actually implemented only for a board with an extremely narrow pitch not to allow pin probes to be adequately set up thereon."
"Thus, the required high accuracy in the pin probes and a jig thereof has been an obstacle in the effort to facilitate the cost reduction in the non-contact/contact combined system."
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a continuity inspection apparatus capable of inspecting any electrical conductivity not only under a high resistance but also under a low resistance by making a capacitance provided in the non-contact system generate a resonance in oscillations of a circuit formed on a board to reduce the impedance of the circuit.
"According to the present invention, an electrode is disposed close to one of ends of a pattern as an inspection object to form a capacitance C between the end and the electrode, and an inductive element L is connected to the capacitance C. An inspection signal (frequency f) including an AC component is applied to the other end of the pattern wire through a pin probe."
"When the impedance of a resonance circuit is reduced by appropriately adjusting the value L, or when the value L is adjusted, for example, so as to satisfy the following formula (1),
2fxc2x7L=(1/2)fxc2x7Cxe2x80x83xe2x80x83(1)
the following formula is derived from the formula (1)."
"L=(1/42)xc3x97f2xc3x97Cxe2x80x83xe2x80x83(2)
In other words, the impedance of the circuit can be zero by adjusting the value L in the formula (2), and then an output voltage V exhibits a maximum value."
Given that VR is the output voltage V in case of using a reference circuit board (i.e.
"a circuit board in which no disconnection has been verified) and applying a resonance frequency fR thereto, the output voltage Vx in case of using an actual circuit board as an inspection object would indicate a larger value because the circuit is expected to come close to a resonance state."
"As one example, when the value of the coupling capacitance is 10 fF, the relationship between the working frequency fR and the inductive element L which can cooperatively generate the resonance state is shown as follows,
when fR=10 kHz, L=25.3 kH, or
when fR=10 MHz, L=25 mH, or
when fR=50 MHz, L=1 mH, or
when fR=100 MHz, L=250 mH."
"A parameter for controlling resonance includes the frequency f of the input inspection signal, the coupling capacitance C, and the inductance L of the inductive element."
"For example, when the electrode has a fixed size and the measuring is carried out with keeping the distance between the electrode and the pattern constant, the capacitance C would be, for example, about 15 fF."
"Then, by adjusting the value of the inductive element L in the range of about 250 mH to about 1 mH, and providing an AC signal source having a frequency ranging from about 50 MHz to about 100 MHz, the impedance can be substantially zero."
"Based on the above knowledge, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a continuity inspection apparatus for inspecting electrical continuity between first and second terminals of a pattern wire formed on a board, comprising:
capacitive coupling means to be capacitively coupled with the first terminal in a non-contact manner to provide a coupling capacitance therebetween;
an inductive element connected to the capacitive coupling means to form a resonance circuit in conjunction with the capacitance yielded by the capacitive coupling means;
a first lead wire connected to the inductive element;
probe means connected to a second lead wire and to be contacted with the second terminal;
signal inputting means for inputting an inspection signal including an AC component into one of the first and second lead wires; and
signal detecting means for detecting an output of the inspection signal at the other of the first and second lead wires."
The arrangement of the inductive element may be variously modified.
"Thus, according to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a continuity inspection apparatus for inspecting electrical continuity between first and second terminals of a pattern wire formed on a board, comprising:
probe means to be directly contacted with the first terminal;
an inductive element connected to the probe means;
a first lead wire connected to the inductive element;
capacitive coupling means connected to a second lead wire and to be capacitively coupled with the second terminal in a non-contact manner to provide a coupling capacitance therebetween;
signal inputting means for inputting an inspection signal including an AC component into one of the first and second lead wires; and
signal detecting means for detecting an output of the inspection signal at the other of the first and second lead wires."
The coupling capacitance may be formed at both the first and second terminals.
"Thus, according to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a continuity inspection apparatus for inspecting electrical continuity between first and second terminals of a pattern wire formed on a board, comprising:
first capacitive coupling means to be capacitively coupled with the first terminal in a non-contact manner to provide a coupling capacitance therebetween;
an inductive element connected to the first capacitive coupling means to form a resonance circuit in conjunction with the capacitance yielded by the first capacitive coupling means;
a first lead wire connected to the inductive element;
second capacitive coupling means connected to a second lead wire and to be capacitively coupled with the second terminal in a non-contact manner to provide coupling capacitance therebetween;
signal inputting means for inputting an inspection signal including an AC component into one of the first and second lead wires; and
signal detecting means for detecting an output of the inspection signal at the other of the first and second lead wire."
The above object of the present invention can also be achieved according to a fourth aspect of the present invention which provides a continuity inspection jig having first and second terminal groups spaced apart each other with leaving a given distance therebetween.
"The continuity inspection jig comprising:
a lead wire connected to all or part of first ends of the first terminal group so as to apply a continuity inspection signal thereto;
contact sections provided respectively at all or part of second ends of the first terminal group and to be contacted with a board as an inspection object;
one or more inductive elements connected to all or part of the second terminal group; and
electrodes provided respectively at all or part of the second ends of the second terminal group and for forming a coupling capacitance without any contact with a wiring pattern of the board as an inspection object."
"The above object can also be achieved according to a fifth aspect of the present invention, which provides a continuity inspection method for inspecting electrical continuity between first and second terminals of a pattern wire formed on a board, comprising the steps of:
positioning a given electrode close to the first terminal to form a coupling capacitance, and connecting a given inductive element to the electrode, followed by connecting a first lead wire to the inductive element and connecting a second lead wire to the second terminal, so as to form a resonance circuit by the first lead wire, inductive element, electrode, coupling capacitance, first terminal, pattern wire, second terminal and second lead wire;
applying an inspection signal including an AC component to one of the first and second lead wires; and
detecting an output of the inspection signal at the other of the first and second lead wires."
"In order to achieve the same object, according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a continuity inspection method for inspecting electrical continuity between first and second terminals of a pattern wire formed on a board, comprising the steps of:
bringing a first lead wire directly into contact with the first terminal through an inductive element, and capacitively coupling a second lead wire with the second terminal in a non-contact manner to provide a coupling capacitance therebetween, so as to form a resonance circuit by the first lead wire, inductive element, first terminal, pattern wire, second terminal, electrode, coupling capacitance and second lead wire;
applying an inspection signal including an AC component to one of the first and second lead wires; and
detecting an output of the inspection signal at the other of the first and second lead wires."
"In order to achieve the same object, according to a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a continuity inspection method for inspecting electrical continuity between first and second terminals of a pattern wire formed on a board, comprising the steps of:
capacitively coupling an inductive element connected to a first lead wire with the first terminal through a first electrode in a non-contact manner, and capacitively coupling a second lead wire with the second terminal through a second electrode in a non-contact manner, so as to form a resonance circuit by the first lead wire, inductive element, first electrode, coupling capacitance, first terminal, pattern wire, second terminal, second electrode, coupling capacitance and second lead wire;
applying an inspection signal including an AC component to one of the first and second lead wires; and
detecting an output of the inspection signal at the other of the first and second lead wires."
"Comparing the above construction with a conventional example having only a coupling capacitance, in case of no inductance L, for example, given that the coupling capacitance C is 10 fF and the working frequency is 10 kHz, the output impedance of the circuit is calculated as follows."
"1          /                      (                          2              ⁢              fC                        )                          =                ⁢                  1          /                      (                          2              xc3x97              3.14              xc3x97                              10                3                            xc3x97                              10                                  -                  15                                                      )                                                  =                ⁢                  1.6          ⁢                      xe2x80x83                    ⁢          G          ⁢                      xe2x80x83                    ⁢          Ω                    
Thus, it is almost impossible to measure a resistance of the pattern."
"Given that the frequency f is 100 MHz, the impedance can be reduced as follows."
"1/(2xc3x973.14xc3x97106xc3x9710xe2x88x9215)=159 kxcexa9
However, in view of cost performance, it is impractical to increase the frequency up to such a value."
"That is, it is extremely important to select an optimum value of frequency."
"Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the above method may further comprise the step of; previous to the step of applying an inspection signal, determining a resonance frequency for a pattern wire between first and second terminals of a given reference board by applying an inspection signal to the reference board while changing the frequency of the inspection signal, and in the step of applying an inspection signal, applying the inspection signal to one of the first and second lead wires with using said determined resonance frequency as a frequency thereof."
It is necessary to define the allowable changing range of the frequency in advance.
"Particularly, one embodiment of the present invention may include the step of; in the step of determining a resonance frequency, changing the frequency of the inspection signal for the reference board within a given range having a center frequency defined by a standard frequency determined based on the constant of the inductive element."
"If the difference between the reference board and an actual board as an inspection object comes up, an apparent difference can be caused in the detected signal."
"In order to compensate this error, one embodiment of the present invention may include the step of; in the step of applying an inspecting signal, changing the frequency of the inspection signal for the board as an inspection object within a given range having a center frequency defined by the frequency determined in the step of determining a resonance frequency."
"Brink of Passion

He’d do anything to protect his mate."
The last thing Laurie expects when she bumps into Max at the shifter convention is finding her mate.
Certainly not that her mate can shift into a leopard.
Wolves and leopards mix about as well as water and oil.
"Or should she say, dogs and cats."
"Mating him means leaving her family, her town, and the only home she’s ever known."
"But the possibility of a happily ever after is worth the risk, right?"
"Max couldn’t be happier with his brazen, feisty wolf, but returning home isn’t the welcoming affair he’d expected."
"In his absence, his brother has been attacked within the leap complex."
Something must to be seriously wrong.
Could someone be using his loved ones to get to him?
"When his worst fears prove true, his protective instinct goes into overdrive."
Will keeping Laurie mean putting her in danger?
"Add it on Goodreads:

“Are you hungry?” he asked."
She shook her head.
"“Drinks then?” Although he’d phrased it as a question, he had no intention of letting her refuse."
"Now that he’d found her, there was no way he’d let her go."
He couldn’t.
The beast inside him wouldn’t stand for it.
"Taking her arm, he steered her toward the front of the hotel."
"Sure, he could have taken her to the hotel bar."
"It would have been faster, and more convenient."
"But the bar was no doubt packed full of shifters, and he wanted more privacy than that."
"He didn’t need a bunch of strangers, who would no doubt sense what was happening, staring and whispering while they were getting to know each other."
"Earlier, he’d seen a pub around the corner from the hotel that seemed promising."
He pointed toward the hotel entrance as they walked and she nodded before moving ahead of him to maneuver through the crowd.
"His fingers still tingled from touching her skin, and every nerve in his body thrummed with awareness."
"His gaze strayed downward to the swing of her hips as she walked, and he bit his lip to hold in a groan."
No doubt the two of them together would burn up the sheets once he got her into his bed.
Soon.
They both knew they’d end up there.
Why deny themselves the pleasure?
"She hesitated a moment, looking over her shoulder, as they walked out of the hotel, making him wonder if she were in fact with a man."
"If so, he admired her loyalty, even if it was no longer relevant."
The poor shmuck would have to find someone else.
"He grabbed her hand, almost groaning at the pleasure merely touching her gave him, and led her down the street."
She had to feel the connection between them.
The inexplicable pull toward each other.
He’d never felt so certain of anything before in his life.
Suddenly he understood the possessiveness other men displayed toward their mates.
A part of him had always sneered at men who found their mates and ignored everything else.
The ones who became so enamored that they professed undying devotion to someone they barely knew.
"He’d always thought those men weak-willed, or somehow kidding themselves."
But now he knew differently.
"No, he wasn’t in love with Laurie—he didn’t even know her—but he was completely and utterly captivated by everything about her."
Love would grow.
What they had between them was more intense and consuming than that.
"As they walked down the street, more men stared at her, some shifters in town for the convention, but plenty of full humans as well."
Annoyance grew at every eye he caught looking at her with interest.
"Laurie appeared either oblivious to the attention, or used to it."
The thought of the latter irritated him further.
Was she looked at so often that she’d become immune to it?
Even women’s eyes were drawn to her.
"When they got to the pub, Max pulled Laurie away from everyone else and into a secluded circular booth."
Away from prying eyes.
He scooted into the booth until they were seated together in the back.
"Her scent drove him wild, and he couldn’t resist rubbing the tip of her hair between his fingers."
"Her eyes tracked his movements, her mouth opening as if she wanted to protest, but after a moment, she closed it."
Pleasure filled him.
"Before the end of the night, Laurie would be his."
The smile vanished from his face as a waiter came to take their orders.
The man’s eyes were riveted on his mate.
A low growl rumbled in his throat.
Pure male satisfaction filled him when the waiter’s eyes widened in fear.
"He left so fast after taking their drink orders, Max was surprised he didn’t leave skid marks."
"“Are you always this friendly, or do I bring out the best in you?” Sarcasm dripped from the words."
"He’d admit it, watching other men ogle his mate was awakening his beast."
“Not me.
You.
"Doesn’t it bother you to have so many people making eyes at you?”

“Making eyes?"
"What are you, eighty?” She laughed and the sound swept through him, punched through his frustration and brought a steady burn of lust in his gut."
"Low, with a hint of roughness that sent chills down his spine."
Desire burned in the back of his throat and pooled in his belly until thoughts of Laurie took over his entire being.
"With another growl, this time one of pure need, Max leaned forward and nipped the top of Laurie’s ear."
"Her laughter ceased, breath catching on a quickly indrawn gasp."
"Fingers dug into his thigh, right above his knee, until he released her ear, soothing it with a small lick before pulling back."
"“I’m being serious.”

Her eyes stared at him in confusion, lust still clouding their depths."
He’d be lying if he said the sight of her desire didn’t fill him with pride and no small amount of excitement for the night ahead.
"After a minute, she shook her head."
He could almost see her scattering droplets of bewilderment just as a dog shakes off water after a bath.
The image broke through the tension from frustration and lust.
"He could be patient, because tonight would be the start of forever."
"“I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”

She didn’t know."
He could see it in her face.
"She wasn’t trying to be cute, or pretend innocence."
She really didn’t see the way everyone stared at her.
"Somehow, that only made her more attractive."
"Unable to resist, he tangled his fingers with hers and leaned his other arm along the back of the booth so that he could play with her hair."
Then he began to get to know her in earnest.
"Israel and the United States sent a secret military delegation to Ukraine to test the Russian-made S-300 missile defense system, which Moscow recently provided to Syria, Hadashot TV news reported Monday, citing Syrian and Russian news outlets."
There was no comment on the reports from either Israel or the US.
"According to the reports, members of the Ukrainian military instructed their US and Israeli counterparts on the capabilities of the system, as well as running through various possible scenarios."
"Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up

One Russian report said that F-15 planes are training in Ukraine against the S-300 as part of an international exercise that includes Israeli pilots."
It wasn’t immediately clear if the Israeli pilots were flying or merely observing from the ground.
Tensions remain high between Russia and Ukraine since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Kremlin has been known to direct misinformation as a tool in the conflict.
"It has been widely reported that the Israeli Air Force has been training against the S-300 in exercises in Greece, perhaps since 2007."
Israel and the US are both thought to be using stealth aircraft in Syrian maneuvers.
"The IAF returned its fleet of F-35 stealth fighters to full service on Sunday, after grounding it last week in light of the state-of-the-art aircraft’s first-ever crash, which took place in the United States, the army said."
The pilot ejected safely.
"Israeli planes have carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria against what it says are Iranian and Hezbollah targets, but there have been no reports of suspected Israeli airstrikes since the accidental Syrian downing of a Russian plane during an Israeli airstrike in Syria, an incident that raised tensions between Israel and Russia."
"Fifteen Russians were killed in the September 17 incident, which Moscow blamed on Israel, accusing its pilots of using the larger Russian plane as cover."
Israel disputes the Russian findings and says its jets were back in Israeli airspace when the plane was downed.
"In response, Moscow announced new measures to protect its military in Syria, including equipping Damascus with S-300 air defense systems."
"Russia and Israel set up a hotline in 2015 to avoid accidental clashes in Syria, but the new measures have led to concern among Israelis that their strikes will now be limited there."
"At the opening of the Knesset’s winter session on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed ties with Russia, saying he is in “direct, frequent contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin” to confront the “complex, very difficult challenges in our region.”

Netanyahu said his personal relationship with Putin has enabled unprecedented “trust” between the two countries."
"“This is very important for Israel’s security,” he said."
The prime minister said last week that he had told Russia’s vice premier that Israel must continue to hit hostile targets in neighboring Syria despite Moscow’s decision to equip Damascus with the S-300.
"Netanyahu said at a press conference that he told Maxim Akimov in talks in Jerusalem that Israel would continue to fight what it says are Iranian attempts to entrench itself militarily in Syria and channel advanced weaponry to its Lebanese ally, the Hezbollah terror group."
"Despite the delivery of the S-300 air defense systems to the Syrian military, Israel was committed as a matter of self-defense to continue its “legitimate activity in Syria against Iran and its proxies, which state their intention to destroy us,” Netanyahu said."

Physico-chemical and biological treatment of MSW landfill leachate.
"This paper analyses the evolution of the physico-chemical characteristics of the leachate from the Central Landfill of Asturias (Spain), which has been operating since 1986, as well as different treatment options."
"The organic pollutant load of the leachate, expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD), reached maximum values during the first year of operation of the landfill (around 80,000 mg/L), gradually decreasing over subsequent years to less than 5000 mg/L."
"The concentration of ammonium, however, has not decreased, presenting values of up to 2000 mg/L."
"When feasible, recirculation can greatly decrease the organic matter content of the leachate to values of 1500-1600 mg COD/L."
"Applying anaerobic treatment to leachates with a COD between 11,000 and 16,000 mg/L, removal efficiencies of 80-88% were obtained for organic loading rates of 7 kg COD/m3d."
"For leachates with lower COD (4000-6000 mg/L), the efficiency decreased to around 60% for organic loading rates of 1 kg COD/m3d."
"Applying coagulation-flocculation with iron trichloride or with aluminium polychloride, it was possible to reduce the non-biodegradable organic matter by 73-62% when treating old landfill leachate (COD: 4800 mg/L, BOD5: 670 mg/L), also reducing turbidity and colour by more than 97%."
"It is likewise possible to reduce the non-biodegradable organic matter that remains after biological treatment by adsorption with activated carbon, although adsorption capacities are usually low (from 15 to 150 mg COD/g adsorbent)."
"As regards ammonium nitrogen, this can be reduced to final effluent values of 5 mg/L by means of nitrification/denitrification and to values of 126 mg/L by stripping at pH 12 and 48 h of stirring."

"Technical Field
The present invention relates to pallets capable of supporting various kinds of objects and movable by a forklift to desired locations."
"More particularly, the present invention relates to an assembly of a pallet component and fasteners that is applicable to making a pallet."
"The pallet component is composed of at least two structural elements, depending on the required dimension of the pallet component, so as to facilitate the making of a stable pallet in accordance with the widths of objects to be placed on the pallet."
"Thus, not only are the mold manufacturing costs and production costs of the pallet significantly reduced, but also a plurality of such pallet components can be stacked in a space-efficient way during transportation."
2.
"Description of Related Art
Conventional pallets for supporting various kinds of objects are typically made by cutting wood boards to the desired sizes and nailing the wood boards according to predetermined configurations."
"As wood pallets are costly, plastic injection-molded pallets have been developed for supporting finished goods and being transported by a forklift."
"The injection molding of plastic pallets requires molds that are manufactured in conformity with the specifications of the pallets, as well as a machine capable of accommodating the molds so that a plastic material can be injection-molded therein."
"Therefore, if pallets of relatively large sizes are to be made by injection molding, the mold manufacturing costs will be high, and the injection molding machine must be increased in size."
"Moreover, as pallets of different dimensions must be formed in different molds and different injection molding machines, the overall equipment costs will be considerable."
"Besides, if a factory is not spacious enough for installing injection molding machines designed for making large pallets, the factory is simply unsuitable for producing such large pallets."
"Furthermore, large pallets usually cannot be stacked in a space-efficient way and therefore take up much space."

"Trichomoniasis

Page address: https://www.mnsu.edu/shs/trichomoniasis.html

Trichomoniasis, or ""trich,"" is a common vaginal infection."
It is caused by a single-celled organism that is usually transmitted sexually.
Both men and women can have trichomoniasis without any symptoms and pass it on to others without even knowing it.
"Symptoms of trichomoniasis infection in women include:

yellow–green, frothy, bubbly, foul–smelling discharge

burning on urination

inflamed external genitalia

Although most men have no symptoms they can transmit this infection to their partners."
"Symptoms of trichomoniasis infection in men include:

a slight ""tingly"" feeling in the penis

painful urination

thin, watery penile discharge

Trichomoniasis is usually treated with oral antibiotics."
"It is important that your partner be treated at the same time you are, even if they show no symptoms."
"Note: If you are being treated for trichomoniasis with Flagyl, avoid drinking any alcoholic beverages during treatment."

Defining has_one with different foreign key

I have two Rails models, Hub and Advisor."
"A Hub has_many Advisors like so:
class Hub < ApplicationRecord

"Logic would dictate that it should be:
has_one :manager, class_name: 'Advisor', primary_key: :manager_id

But when I save like so:
hub.manager = advisor
hub.save

The hub ID doesn't get set."
What gives?

This code doesn't compile because the compiler has no idea what T is."
I would like to constrain T so that it must inherit a certain class that defines somethingSpecial.
Bonus points if you can tell me how to do the same thing by contraining T so that it must implement a certain interface.
"A:

public class MyClass<T> where T: IAmSomethingSpecial

It's called Constraints on Type Parameters."
"A:

Use the following type parameter constraint in the class declaration:

[Ticks and hemoparasitoses of livestock in Senegal.
VI.
The Soudano-Sahelian zone].
"The authors report the results of a study on ticks and hemoparasitoses among cattle, sheep and goats in the Sudano-Sahelian zone."
"During a period of 15 months, ticks were systematically removed from 40 cattle, 40 sheep and 40 goats in order to assess the population dynamics and determine more accurately the preferential sites of settlement of the different species."
"The following species were collected in ruminants: Hyalomma truncatum, H. marginatum rufipes, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Rh."
"guilhoni, Amblyomma variegatum, Boophilus decoloratus."
"Concurrently, studies were made on hemoparasitoses using blood smears and splenectomy."
"The following species were found in cattle: Anaplasma marginale, Ehrlichia bovis, Theileria mutans."
"Infections detected in sheep and goats were caused by Anaplasma ovis, Ehrlichia ovina and Theileria ovis."
The PCV values of apparently healthy nature animals as well as the seasonal variations in this hematological parameter were investigated.
"WEDNESDAY, June 14, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Millions of older people often turn to do-it-yourself home blood pressure monitors to track that vital health sign."
"But a small, new Canadian study suggests that readings from the devices are wrong most of the time and could put patients at risk."
"A team led by Jennifer Ringrose, of the University of Alberta in Calgary, tested dozens of home monitors used by 85 patients averaging 66 years of age."
The researchers found the units weren't accurate within five mmHg of blood pressure about 70 percent of the time.
"And the devices were off the mark by at least 10 mmHg about 30 percent of the time, the investigators added."
"That inaccuracy could have serious consequences for people's health, Ringrose said."
"""Monitoring for and treating hypertension [high blood pressure] can decrease the consequences of this disease,"" she said."
"""We need to make sure that home blood pressure readings are accurate."""
One U.S. expert in diabetes and its related heart risks agreed that the findings are troubling.
"""This study highlights why it is so difficult to treat hypertension,"" said Dr. Robert Courgi."
"He's a specialist in diabetes care at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.

""If the home blood pressure monitors were more accurate, we would have a better chance at successful treatment of hypertension,"" he said."
Should people who have bought and use these monitors toss them out?
Maybe not.
"According to Ringrose, there are a number of ways to minimize inaccurate readings with the devices."
"First, she said, ""compare the blood pressure machine measurement with a blood pressure measurement in a clinic before exclusively relying upon home blood pressure readings."""
"Also, ""what's really important is to do several blood pressure measurements and base treatment decisions on multiple readings,"" Ringrose added."
"Home monitoring may still be very useful,"" she said, ""because it ""empowers patients and [it] is helpful for clinicians to have a bigger picture rather than just one snapshot in time."""
"Patients should not have blood pressure medications started or changed based on one or two measurements taken at a single point in time unless the measurements are clearly elevated, noted study co-author Raj Padwal."
Dr. Yasir El-Sherif directs stroke care at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.
"He called the findings ""interesting and clinically relevant in that many physicians request their patients to keep daily logs of their blood pressures."
"I and many neurologists who care for stroke patients regularly ask our patients to keep daily logs of their blood pressures using an automated device and inform us of a trend upwards."""
"El-Sherif said the study population was too small to deliver concrete conclusions, but it ""does raise concern."""
"Certain factors -- inappropriately sized arm cuffs, patients with a specific type of blood pressure -- may combine with inaccurate readings to give some patients a ""a false sense of security,"" he said."
El-Sharif's advice?
"""Patients who use these automated blood pressure devices should bring them to their physicians once or even twice to measure their accuracy against a [office-based] manual measurement,"" he said."
The study was published recently in the American Journal of Hypertension.
"Q:

Synchronizing UIView animation speed with audio playback

I have a vertical one-pixel view that I want to move over a grid that represents notes being played."
Depending on the BPM (beats per minute) of the song the animation should be slower or faster.
The notes are squeezed next to each other and have a width of 25px.
"The way I'm doing this right now is by moving the view 1px to the right every time x samples have passed:
int bpm = 90;
int interval = (44100 * 60.0f / song.bpm) / 25.0f; // = 1176
// sample rate=44100 multiplied by 60 (seconds) divided by number of pixels

So with BPM=90 I move the UIView 1px every 1176 samples played."
This works fairly well but gives me problems if the BPM is higher than 180.
At that point the view is behind on the music that is played and when BPM goes up to 240 the view is way off.
How can I do this with the built in animation features of Views and base the animation speed on the calculations I posted above?
I want to start the animation once the music starts playing so I don't need to manually move it pixel by pixel.
"A:

If I understood correctly, what you want to do is:

Draw a static background image."
Draw a vertical line on top of that which moves from left to right.
Synchronize the line's x position with the audio playback time.
"There are two problems to solve:

Drawing performance
Audio synchronization

To get the drawing performance right there are two implementations to consider:

Using Core Animation layers and animation (much easier to implement than 2.)"
Using OpenGL to draw the whole view (possibly a little faster and a little less latency than 1.)
"Implementing the view in OpenGL is too much code to post as an example, but here's code for the Core Animation option:
// In the UIViewController:

- (CALayer *)markerLayer
{
    static NSString *uniqueName = @""com.mydomain.MarkerLayer"";
    for (CALayer *layer in self.view.layer.sublayers) {
        if ([layer.name isEqualToString:uniqueName])
            return layer;
    }

    CALayer *markerLayer = [CALayer layer];
    markerLayer.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor].CGColor;
    markerLayer.name = uniqueName;
    markerLayer.anchorPoint = CGPointZero;
    [self.view.layer addSublayer:markerLayer];
    return markerLayer;
}

- (void)startAnimationWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration
{
    [CATransaction begin];
    [CATransaction setDisableActions:YES];

    CALayer *markerLayer = [self markerLayer];

    markerLayer.bounds = (CGRect){.size = {1, self.view.bounds.size.height}};
    markerLayer.position = CGPointZero;
    [CATransaction commit];

    CABasicAnimation *animation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@""position.x""];
    animation.fromValue = @0.0f;
    animation.toValue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:self.view.bounds.size.width];
    animation.duration = duration;
    [markerLayer addAnimation:animation forKey:@""audioAnimation""];
}

Audio synchronization is very much depending on the way you are playing it, for example using AVFoundation or Core Audio."
To get precise synchronization you would need some kind of callback from the audio engine that tells you where exactly the playback is right now or when it did start.
Maybe it is enough to just call startAnimationWithDuration: immediately before you start the audio but that seems kind of fragile and depends on the latency of the audio framework.
Anti-Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody Associated With Gray Matter Predominant Transverse Myelitis Mimicking Acute Flaccid Myelitis: A Presentation of Two Cases.
"Anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody associated disorders frequently manifest as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis."
"While their clinical phenotypes overlap with relapsing inflammatory Central nervous system (CNS) conditions such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, MOG-related syndromes frequently occur in a younger age group."
"In children, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is less specific for anti-aquaporin-4 associated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and has also been reported in pediatric multiple sclerosis, idiopathic transverse myelitis, and acute flaccid myelitis."
We summarize two patients with positive MOG antibodies and myelitis.
We identified two individuals with anti-MOG associated LETM that demonstrate primarily gray matter involvement.
Clinically these patients exhibited hyperreflexia and had rapid improvement with immunotherapies.
"Anti-MOG diseases can cause LETM with gray matter predominance mimicking acute flaccid myelitis, but clinically these patients can have retained reflexes and respond favorably to immunotherapies."
