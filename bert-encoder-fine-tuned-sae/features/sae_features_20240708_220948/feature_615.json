They have various formats, including mathematical notations and chemical formulas, as well as informal elements like emojis and internet slangs. The samples exhibit a mix of structured, academic writing and casual social media expressions. This variety appears to be the most specific attribute that differentiates these samples from the other set which primarily contains conversational text lacking the highly technical, numerical, or formatted content seen here.",
