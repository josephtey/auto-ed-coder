These texts often include specific references to events, people, places, and institutions, indicating their informative and structured nature. In contrast, the other samples are informal conversations, opinions, or casual remarks that do not have the same structured and informative characteristics. The most specific attribute I found that all the samples share is the presence of proper nouns, formal titles, dates, and structured factual content, which indicates a more formal and informative nature.",
