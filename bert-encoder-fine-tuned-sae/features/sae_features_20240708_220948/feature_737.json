Additionally, they often contain detailed, well-organized data, and include citations, coordinates, formal names, and events. These types of content are intricate and specific in details. On the other hand, the other samples are informal conversational texts that revolve around opinions, discussions, and narrative accounts of personal experiences without structured or technical information.",
