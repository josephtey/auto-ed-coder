The text includes narrative elements, mentions of specific events, expressions of personal sentiments, and details about specific subjects or topics. This distinguishes the texts from those in the other samples, which mainly consist of conversational or speculative writing and general commentary. The texts also often have a structured composition with sentences and phrases that appear more formal or informative in nature.",
