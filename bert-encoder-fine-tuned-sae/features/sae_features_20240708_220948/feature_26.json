Specifically, they often include technical terms, numerical data, research information, or dialogue from identifiable contexts like scientific texts, directions, or structured inputs. This distinguishes them from the more conversational and opinion-based narratives found in the samples. The are more likely to include sentences with specific references, including names, locations, technical terms, formal language, and numerical values. Furthermore, they often feature fragments or interrupted sentences like inputs, whereas the samples are more cohesive paragraphs with coherent flow.",
