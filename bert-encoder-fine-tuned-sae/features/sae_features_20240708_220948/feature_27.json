Additionally, they have a high presence of dates, times, numerical data, and longer, more complex sentence structures. They also frequently switch between different topics or sections within a single sample. In contrast, the samples analyzed have a more conversational tone, seem more opinionated or speculative, and lack the structured and varied content seen in the other samples.",
