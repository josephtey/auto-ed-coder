The samples contain a mix of mathematical, scientific, and academic content, along with personal statements and formal writing styles. They tend to have sentences that include logical reasoning, formal academic language, mathematical notation, and structured formatting. On the other hand, the samples show informal conversations, personal opinions, and casual language without structured or formal academic content. The presence of mathematical formulas, scholarly references, and structured academic content such as technical documentation or scientific studies is a defining feature of the samples.",
