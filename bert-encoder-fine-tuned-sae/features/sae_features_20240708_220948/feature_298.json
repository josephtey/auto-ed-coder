Many sentences end with punctuation like periods, exclamation marks, and commas. Additionally, there are several references to dates, numbers, and section markers. In contrast, the other samples predominantly consist of casual conversations or commentaries, often lacking in formal or structured writing. They do not exhibit the same range of formal and scientific communication, nor do they showcase a variety of structured data formats like periods, commas, exclamations, or scientific notations.",
