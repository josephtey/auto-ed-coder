Specifically, all of the texts in the samples adhere to a formal writing style, detailed factual information, and often involve references to events, individuals, or technical data. This includes precise language, complete sentences, and a focus on presenting information or discussing topics in a comprehensive manner. In contrast, the texts in the other samples are more informal, conversational, and fragmented, often containing personal opinions, rhetorical questions, and incomplete sentences.",
