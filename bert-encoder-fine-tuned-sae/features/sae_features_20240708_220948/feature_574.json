They also contain structured information, often linked to legal, educational, or procedural contexts. The samples exhibit a consistent formality in language, presenting specific details or instructions, often found in formal documentation or professional contexts. In contrast, the other samples are more conversational, informal, and opinion-based, lacking the structured and formal tone.",
