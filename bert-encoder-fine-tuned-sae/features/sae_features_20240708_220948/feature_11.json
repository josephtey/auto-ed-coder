The samples often include structured forms such as quotes, categories, references, and sections. They also contain a varied and often complex sentence structure, are rich in literary and academic references, and frequently discuss philosophical, legal, and technical topics. In contrast, the other samples are mostly conversational English, discuss recent events or opinions, and lack the structured and formal elements present in the samples.",
