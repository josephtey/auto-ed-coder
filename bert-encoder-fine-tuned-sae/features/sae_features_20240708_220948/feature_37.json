These details indicate a rich and varied context, incorporating both formal and informal writing styles. Additionally, they often provide specific information or describe events in a structured way. Conversely, the other samples contain more conversational dialogue, debates, chat-like interactions, and opinions, which are generally less detailed and less formal.",
