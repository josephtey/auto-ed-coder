The primary distinguishing feature of the samples is their focus on factual and descriptive content. These texts tend to describe specific physical attributes, features, and technical details about buildings, mechanical systems, and locations, often using precise terminologies and technical language. They typically avoid abstract, conversational, or opinion-based language, which is present in the samples. As such, the shared attribute is the presence of detailed descriptive or technical content.",
