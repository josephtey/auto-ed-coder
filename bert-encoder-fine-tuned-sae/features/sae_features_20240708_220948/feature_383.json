The samples in the first group contain structured elements such as names, dates, addresses, signatures, and formal phrases, indicative of formal documentation, case files, medical records, or legal proceedings. The overall tone and components suggest that these are excerpts from official documents. In contrast, the samples in the second group are more informal, resembling conversational text or social media exchanges, lacking the formal structure and specific details seen in the first group.",
