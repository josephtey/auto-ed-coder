    "reasoning": "Upon analyzing the samples, it is evident that the shared attribute among the samples is the frequent use of parenthetical expressions, notation of scientific terms, abbreviations, temperatures with units, and references to physical or chemical properties. Additionally, the samples have structured and technical language, often using specialized terminology and providing measurements or evidence related to scientific or technical contexts. These attributes are consistently found in the samples, distinguishing them from the other samples which are more conversational and lack this precise, technical terminology and structure.",
