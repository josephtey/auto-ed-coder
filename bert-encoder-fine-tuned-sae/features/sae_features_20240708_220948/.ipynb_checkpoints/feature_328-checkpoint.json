They cover various topics such as personal experiences, scientific discussions, and formal declarations. In contrast, the texts in the second set consist of informal language, chat-like fragments, incomplete sentences, and a lack of clear, reasoned arguments. These texts often appear disjointed, conversational, and focus on personal opinions and assumptions rather than structured narratives or descriptions.",
