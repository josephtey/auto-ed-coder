The samples contain mixed content including reviews, specific geographical descriptions, technical or specialized information, user comments, and excerpts from dialogues, with often non-sequential or abrupt topic shifts. These samples often feel like they could be snippets from articles, reviews, comments, or informal writings and contain diverse topics ranging from personal experiences, technical content, to casual statements. Meanwhile, the other samples focus on highly contextually coherent narratives around specific incidents or discussions, primarily related to political or social issues.",
