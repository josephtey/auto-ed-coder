They include names of people, organizations, studies, legal references, locations, and other specific proper nouns. Conversely, the texts in the second category (negative samples) are more focused on general discourse, discussions, opinions, and conversational topics without detailed and specific references to proper nouns or specific events. The presence of proper nouns and specific references to concrete entities and events is a substantial and distinctive attribute shared exclusively by the first category.",
