    "reasoning": "Upon reviewing the samples, it appears that all the texts within the samples have specific structured content including: exact phrases, scientific descriptions, programming code, dialogue from scripts or specific names/events that reference popular culture or product/service announcements. There are significant portions where anticipation ('expect!') is used. Additionally, there is extensive use of quotation marks, commas, parentheses, specific formatting such as variable names or XML tags, and the texts seem more fragmented or bullet-point like. The negative samples, however, have a more continuous and cohesive narrative style with informal or conversational language without the same level of structured details or formatting.",
