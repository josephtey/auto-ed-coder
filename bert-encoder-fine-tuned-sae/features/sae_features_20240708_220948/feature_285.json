They include literary sentences, technical language, coding snippets, dialogue, historical information, and scientific descriptions. The samples also include multiple languages (English and Russian). On the other hand, the negative samples are primarily conversational, opinionated, and contain contemporary internet discourse, focusing on informal discussions and commentary on various topics. The width of context and type diversification is the distinctive factor.",
