They also contain different languages and are contextually rich, often with complete narrative or descriptive sentences. In contrast, the samples are often part of dialogues, forum posts, or casual conversations which are less structured, and frequently include informal language and colloquial speech. Additionally, the samples tend to have incomplete or broken sentences and lack the depth seen in the samples.",
