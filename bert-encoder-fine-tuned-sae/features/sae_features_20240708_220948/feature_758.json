These samples also tend to contain more dramatic or mind-stimulating statements or questions, indicating higher levels of engagement, curiosity, or urgency, often accompanied by direct or indirect speech. In contrast, the other set of samples revolves around conversational or informal language, usually consisting of simpler sentence structures, less punctuation, and lack of domain-specific terminology.",
