These samples often contain detailed, factual, and structured information, and some may include complex terminology or references to specific studies or data. Additionally, the positive samples frequently mix different languages and use technical formatting like citations and special characters. In contrast, the negative samples mainly exhibit informal conversational language, personal opinions, and predominantly discuss current events or political topics, often presented in paragraph form.",
