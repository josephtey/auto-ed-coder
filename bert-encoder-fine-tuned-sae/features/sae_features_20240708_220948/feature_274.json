    "reasoning": "Upon comparing the texts, it becomes clear that the samples tend to be rich in context and contain detailed information or narratives across various topics like sports, science, history, and news. They frequently include complex structures, specific dates, systematic sequences, scientific concepts, names of people and places, and comprehensive descriptions. In contrast, the other samples lack this depth and detail, often containing casual conversation, incomplete thoughts, or unfocused narratives.",
