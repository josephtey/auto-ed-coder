There is an abundance of adjectives and detailed imagery used to paint a picture for the reader. This is not solely limited to the use of adjectives, but rather the purpose of these descriptions is to create a vivid scene or elaborate on the topic in a way that enriches the reader's experience. This descriptive quality is absent in the other samples, which tend to be more straightforward and lack detailed imagery.",
