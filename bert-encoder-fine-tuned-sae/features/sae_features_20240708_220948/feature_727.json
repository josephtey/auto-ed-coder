These samples often contain sentences that are abrupt, sometimes standalone words or phrases, and seem to include non-English phrases or complex constructions. On the other hand, the samples in the second set tend to be more extended discussions, coherent paragraphs, and lack the frequent use of abrupt punctuation marks.",
