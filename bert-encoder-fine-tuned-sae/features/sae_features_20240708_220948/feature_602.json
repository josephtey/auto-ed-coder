They are constructed in a way that they could plausibly stand alone or within a narrative while some may be idiosyncratic. In contrast, the texts in the second set include conversational language, informal dialogue, references to specific individuals or events, and have a more disorganized or comment-style structure often found in discussions. The key differentiator is the self-contained and declarative nature of the first set as opposed to the interactive and discursive nature of the second set.",
