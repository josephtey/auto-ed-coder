They include technical terms, complete sentences, proper nouns, references to specific locations, scientific content, and a mix of multiple languages. Additionally, many of the texts provide detailed explanations, technical descriptions, and specific narratives. In contrast, the texts from the samples mainly consist of casual, conversational language and lack the detailed and structured content seen in the texts from the samples. The samples contain varied topics and often encapsulate complex ideas or detailed ornate descriptions.",
